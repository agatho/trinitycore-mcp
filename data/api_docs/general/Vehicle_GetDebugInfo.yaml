documentation:
  brief: Retrieves debug information identifier for the vehicle object
  description: The GetDebugInfo method returns an integer identifier used for debugging
    and tracking vehicle instances within the TrinityCore framework. This debug identifier
    typically corresponds to internal engine tracking mechanisms that help developers
    and administrators monitor vehicle behavior, ownership, and state during runtime.
    The returned value is often used in logging systems, debugging tools, or administrative
    commands to uniquely identify specific vehicle objects in the game world. This
    method does not modify any vehicle state and is purely informational for diagnostic
    purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer debug identifier that uniquely represents this vehicle instance
    within the TrinityCore engine. The exact value format depends on internal implementation
    but typically serves as a handle or reference number for debugging systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    int debugInfo\
      \ = vehicle->GetDebugInfo();\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"vehicle\", \"Vehicle debug\
      \ info: {}\", debugInfo);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and development purposes.
    The returned integer value may vary between different TrinityCore builds or configurations.
    It should not be relied upon for game logic or gameplay mechanics as its format
    and meaning are implementation-specific.
  warnings: Do not use the return value for gameplay decisions or state management.
    The debug identifier is not guaranteed to remain stable across different server
    instances or client versions, and should only be used in development environments
    or logging contexts.
