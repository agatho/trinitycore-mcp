documentation:
  brief: Returns the configuration string specifying which auction house items are
    included in the AHBot's operations.
  description: The GetAHBotIncludes method retrieves the current configuration string
    that defines which item types or categories are included for auction house bot
    (AHBot) activities. This setting determines which items the AHBot will consider
    when generating, managing, or interacting with auctions on the auction house.
    The returned string typically contains a list of item class and subclass identifiers
    or other filtering criteria used by the AHBot to determine eligibility for its
    operations. This method is part of the AuctionBotConfig class that manages various
    configuration settings for the AHBot system in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the AHBot includes configuration.
    This string represents the filtering criteria used by the auction house bot to
    determine which items should be included in its operations. The format of this
    string is typically defined by the AHBot's configuration system and may contain
    item class/subclass identifiers or other category-based filters.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve AHBot includes configuration
    code: 'AuctionBotConfig config;

      const std::string& includes = config.GetAHBotIncludes();

      std::cout << "AHBot includes: " << includes << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference to avoid unnecessary copying of
    the configuration string. The returned value should not be modified directly as
    it's meant to be read-only. The configuration string format is dependent on the
    AHBot implementation and may vary between different TrinityCore versions or custom
    configurations.
