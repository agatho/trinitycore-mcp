documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PaladinAI instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The PaladinAI destructor is responsible for cleaning up all dynamically
    allocated memory and resources used by the Paladin AI behavior system. This includes
    releasing any pointers to game objects, clearing internal state variables, and
    ensuring proper cleanup of AI-related data structures. The destructor is automatically
    called when a PaladinAI object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It
    ensures that no memory leaks occur in the AI subsystem and that all references
    to the associated player or creature are properly handled before the object is
    destroyed.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'PaladinAI* ai = new PaladinAI(creature);

      // ... AI logic here ...

      delete ai; // Triggers ~PaladinAI() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is part of the standard C++ object lifecycle and should not
    be called directly. It's automatically invoked during object destruction. Developers
    should ensure that no other objects hold references to the PaladinAI instance
    after deletion to prevent dangling pointer issues.
