  class: FollowerAI
  method: UpdateAI
  signature: void FollowerAI::UpdateAI(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the AI behavior for a follower unit based on the provided time delta
    parameter.
  description: The UpdateAI method is responsible for executing the core artificial
    intelligence logic for follower units in TrinityCore. This method is typically
    called by the game engine's main update loop at regular intervals, and it processes
    the follower's current state, target tracking, movement behavior, and interaction
    with the player or environment. The method handles tasks such as maintaining follow
    distance, avoiding obstacles, responding to combat situations, and executing quest-related
    behaviors. It serves as the primary driver for follower AI functionality within
    the World of Warcraft emulation framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since last update call. This parameter
      determines how much time has passed since the previous AI update, allowing the
      follower to adjust its behavior based on elapsed time for smooth movement and
      timing-sensitive actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateAI Call
    code: "void MyFollower::UpdateAI(int diff)\n{\n    if (!HasFollowState(STATE_FOLLOWING))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    FollowerAI::UpdateAI(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom AI Update with Extended Logic
    code: "void CustomFollowerAI::UpdateAI(int diff)\n{\n    if (!HasFollowState(STATE_FOLLOWING))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Perform custom behavior before base AI update\n\
      \    if (GetOwner() && GetOwner()->IsInCombat())\n        SetFollowState(STATE_FOLLOWING\
      \ | STATE_COMBAT);\n    \n    FollowerAI::UpdateAI(diff);\n    \n    // Additional\
      \ post-update logic\n    if (HasFollowState(STATE_COMBAT))\n        HandleCombatBehavior();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The UpdateAI method is automatically invoked by the core game engine and
    should not be called directly from external code unless implementing custom AI
    behavior. The parameter represents a time delta that allows for smooth, frame-rate
    independent movement calculations. This method assumes that the follower unit
    has been properly initialized with a valid owner and follow state.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly in custom implementations without understanding
    its internal dependencies. Incorrect handling of the time delta parameter can
    cause erratic movement behavior or timing issues. The method relies on the follower
    having a valid player owner and proper initialization of follow states.
