  class: RotateMovementGenerator
  method: Deactivate
  signature: void RotateMovementGenerator::Deactivate(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the rotation movement generator, stopping any ongoing rotational
    movement.
  description: The Deactivate method is used to halt and disable a RotateMovementGenerator
    instance. This method is typically called when the movement generator needs to
    be suspended or terminated, such as when a unit's movement state changes or when
    the generator is no longer required. The method ensures that any active rotational
    movement is stopped and the generator transitions into an inactive state. In the
    context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method is part of the AI and
    movement system where units may need to dynamically change their movement behavior
    based on combat or environmental conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that may be used to control deactivation
      behavior or provide additional context for the deactivation process. The exact
      usage depends on implementation details within the movement generator system.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Usage
    code: 'RotateMovementGenerator* rotator = new RotateMovementGenerator();

      rotator->Deactivate(nullptr); // Deactivates the rotation movement generator

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivation with Parameter Context
    code: 'int deactivateFlag = 1;

      RotateMovementGenerator* rotator = new RotateMovementGenerator();

      rotator->Deactivate(&deactivateFlag); // Deactivates with specific flag context

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely modifies internal state flags to indicate that the movement
    generator is no longer active. It may also trigger cleanup routines or notify
    other systems about the change in movement status.
  warnings: Calling Deactivate on an already inactive generator may lead to undefined
    behavior if not properly handled by the implementation. Ensure proper state checking
    before calling this method.
