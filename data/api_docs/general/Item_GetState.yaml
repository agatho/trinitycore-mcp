  class: Item
  method: GetState
  signature: ItemUpdateState Item::GetState() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current update state of the item, indicating whether it's in
    a pending, active, or removed state.
  description: The GetState method retrieves the current ItemUpdateState of an item
    object, which reflects its status within the game world. This state determines
    how the item is handled during updates and synchronization with clients. The method
    is essential for understanding the item's lifecycle and ensuring proper handling
    during various game operations such as item creation, destruction, or modification.
    It helps developers determine if an item is currently being processed or has been
    removed from the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ItemUpdateState enum value that indicates the current state
    of the item. Possible values include ITEM_UPDATE_PENDING (item is awaiting update),
    ITEM_UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS (item is actively being updated), and ITEM_UPDATE_REMOVED
    (item has been removed from the game world). The return value provides insight
    into how the item should be handled during synchronization operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "ItemUpdateState state = item->GetState();\nif (state == ITEM_UPDATE_REMOVED)\n\
      {\n    // Handle removed item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and should be called from within the context of
    a game thread. It's important to note that the state returned may change during
    the execution of a function, especially in multi-threaded environments where item
    updates occur asynchronously.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method in conjunction with other item-related
    methods, as the state can change between calls. Also, calling GetState on a removed
    item may result in undefined behavior if not properly handled.
