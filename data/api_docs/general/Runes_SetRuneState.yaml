  class: Runes
  method: SetRuneState
  signature: void Runes::SetRuneState(uint8 index, bool set)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the state of a specified rune to either active or inactive.
  description: The SetRuneState method is used to control the activation state of
    a specific rune within the Runes class. This functionality is typically employed
    in the context of player character abilities, particularly for Death Knights who
    utilize runes as part of their combat mechanics. The method takes an index representing
    which rune to modify and a boolean value indicating whether to set the rune as
    active (true) or inactive (false). This allows for precise control over rune regeneration
    and usage within the game's combat system.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: The zero-based index of the rune to modify. Valid values are typically
      0-5 for standard Death Knight runes.
  - name: set
    description: Boolean value indicating the desired state of the rune. True sets
      the rune as active, false sets it as inactive.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate a Rune
    code: 'Runes* runes = player->GetRunes();

      runes->SetRuneState(0, true); // Activate the first rune'
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate a Rune
    code: 'Runes* runes = player->GetRunes();

      runes->SetRuneState(3, false); // Deactivate the fourth rune'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the game engine during rune regeneration
    events or when abilities are cast. It directly modifies internal rune state flags
    and should be used carefully to maintain synchronization with the game's combat
    system.
  warnings: Direct manipulation of rune states may cause desynchronization with the
    client-side UI if not properly coordinated with the game's rune regeneration logic.
    Avoid calling this method outside of appropriate combat or regeneration contexts.
