documentation:
  brief: Sets the cache size for loot analysis operations
  description: Configures the maximum number of items that can be cached during loot
    analysis processing. This method adjusts the internal buffer size used to store
    temporary loot data during item evaluation and distribution calculations. The
    cache size directly impacts memory usage and performance during high-volume loot
    scenarios such as raid encounters or large-scale item drops. Setting an appropriate
    cache size is crucial for maintaining optimal server performance while ensuring
    all relevant loot data is properly tracked.
  parameters:
  - name: size
    description: The maximum number of items to cache for loot analysis operations.
      Valid values are positive integers representing the desired cache capacity.
      Larger values allow more items to be stored temporarily but consume more memory.
      Typical usage ranges from 100-10000 depending on server configuration and expected
      loot volume.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Size Configuration
    code: 'LootAnalysis* lootAnalyzer = new LootAnalysis();

      lootAnalyzer->SetCacheSize(500);

      // Configures the loot analyzer to cache up to 500 items'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance-Optimized Cache Setting
    code: 'LootAnalysis* analyzer = sWorld->GetLootAnalyzer();

      uint32 optimalSize = sWorld->getConfig(CONFIG_LOOT_ANALYSIS_CACHE_SIZE);

      analyzer->SetCacheSize(optimalSize);

      // Sets cache size based on server configuration for optimal performance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal cache behavior of the LootAnalysis class.
    The cache is used to temporarily store item data during loot evaluation and should
    be sized appropriately for server load. Changes take effect immediately without
    requiring restart or additional initialization.
  warnings: Setting cache size too high may lead to excessive memory consumption,
    especially during peak server activity. Setting it too low might cause performance
    degradation due to frequent cache evictions and re-computation of loot data.
