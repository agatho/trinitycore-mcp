  signature: void ArenaAI::Execute2v2DPSHealer(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the 2v2 DPS/Healer AI behavior for an arena player.
  description: The Execute2v2DPSHealer method implements the artificial intelligence
    logic specific to 2v2 arena battles for players acting as either damage dealers
    or healers. This method determines the appropriate actions a bot or AI-controlled
    player should take during combat, including target selection, spell casting priorities,
    and movement strategies tailored for the 2v2 arena format. It is typically invoked
    during the arena combat loop to make real-time decisions based on the current
    game state, health levels, mana availability, and enemy positions. The method
    assumes that the player is already in an arena environment and has been assigned
    a specific role (DPS or Healer) within a 2v2 team.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the index or identifier of the
      player in the arena team. This parameter is used to determine which player's
      AI logic should be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat
    code: "void MyArenaHandler::UpdateArenaAI()\n{\n    int playerIndex = 0;\n   \
      \ arenaAI->Execute2v2DPSHealer(&playerIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing AI for both players in a 2v2 team
    code: "void ArenaTeam::UpdateAllPlayers()\n{\n    int player1 = 0;\n    int player2\
      \ = 1;\n    arenaAI->Execute2v2DPSHealer(&player1);\n    arenaAI->Execute2v2DPSHealer(&player2);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI system for TrinityCore's arena implementation.
    It relies on accurate state tracking of player health, mana, and combat status.
    Developers should ensure that the player parameter correctly identifies a valid
    arena participant before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization or with an invalid player
    index may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that all necessary
    game state data is available and up-to-date.
