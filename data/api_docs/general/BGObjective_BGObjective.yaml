documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BGObjective instance with default values and prepares it
    for use in battleground scenarios.
  description: The BGObjective constructor initializes a new battleground objective
    instance. This method sets up the internal state of the objective, including default
    values for its properties such as ownership, progress, and status flags. It ensures
    that the objective is properly configured to participate in battleground mechanics
    like capture points, resource gathering, or control-based objectives. The initialization
    process typically involves setting up base class members and establishing initial
    conditions required for the objective to function within the game's battleground
    framework. This constructor is automatically called when creating new BGObjective
    objects and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required by advanced
    custom battleground implementations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new battleground objective
    code: 'BGObjective* objective = new BGObjective();

      // The objective is now initialized and ready for use in battleground logic

      objective->Initialize(); // Example of additional setup if needed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when battleground objectives are created. Developers should not directly instantiate
    BGObjective objects unless implementing custom battleground mechanics. The constructor
    ensures proper initialization of all internal state variables required for battleground
    objective functionality.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of BGObjective objects outside of the framework's
    internal battleground system may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always
    use the provided factory methods or framework interfaces when creating battleground
    objectives.
