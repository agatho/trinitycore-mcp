  class: Object
  method: SendUpdateToPlayer
  signature: void Object::SendUpdateToPlayer(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Sends object update data to a specific player client.
  description: The SendUpdateToPlayer method is responsible for transmitting the current
    state of an Object to a specific Player client. This method is typically invoked
    when an object's properties have changed and need to be synchronized with the
    player's view of the game world. It ensures that the player's client receives
    the latest information about the object, such as position, orientation, visual
    appearance, or other relevant attributes. The update is sent through the appropriate
    network protocol messages to maintain synchronization between server state and
    client representation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object to which the update data will be sent.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Update to a Specific Player
    code: 'Object* obj = ...;

      Player* targetPlayer = ...;

      obj->SendUpdateToPlayer(targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Players
    code: "Object* obj = ...;\nfor (auto& player : playerList)\n{\n    obj->SendUpdateToPlayer(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop or during
    object state changes. It may trigger network serialization of the object's data,
    which can be performance-sensitive for frequently updated objects like players
    or moving creatures.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null. Calling this method on an object that has been destroyed or is in an invalid
    state may lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
