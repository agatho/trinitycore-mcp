documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PointMovementGenerator instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PointMovementGenerator class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when a
    PointMovementGenerator object is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks in
    the game's AI movement system. It is automatically invoked when the object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor does not take any parameters
    and performs no special operations beyond standard cleanup.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of PointMovementGenerator
    code: 'PointMovementGenerator* generator = new PointMovementGenerator();

      // ... use the generator ...

      delete generator; // Triggers ~PointMovementGenerator()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is part of the standard C++ object lifecycle management and
    should not be called directly. It is automatically invoked by the runtime when
    an object is destroyed, ensuring proper cleanup of movement-related data structures.
