  class: Spell
  method: SelectImplicitTargetObjectTargets
  signature: void Spell::SelectImplicitTargetObjectTargets(const SpellEffectInfo &
    spellEffectInfo, const SpellImplicitTargetInfo & targetType)
documentation:
  brief: Selects implicit target object targets for a spell effect based on provided
    spell effect info and target type.
  description: This method processes the selection of implicit target objects for
    a spell effect, determining which targets are valid based on the provided SpellEffectInfo
    and SpellImplicitTargetInfo. It handles the logic for selecting appropriate targets
    for spells that may have multiple possible targets, such as area-of-effect spells
    or spells targeting multiple objects. The method is crucial for proper spell execution
    and target selection in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, ensuring that
    correct targets are chosen based on game mechanics and spell properties.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains information about the specific spell effect being processed,
      including effect type, level, and other relevant parameters that determine target
      selection behavior.
  - name: targetType
    description: Defines the implicit target type information for the spell effect,
      specifying how targets should be selected based on game rules and spell mechanics.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::SelectImplicitTargetObjectTargets(const SpellEffectInfo & spellEffectInfo,\
      \ const SpellImplicitTargetInfo & targetType)\n{\n    // Implementation logic\n\
      }\n\n// Usage in a spell handler\nSpell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);\n\
      spell->SelectImplicitTargetObjectTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell processing system and should be called
    during spell initialization. It requires proper handling of target selection rules
    and may involve complex logic for different target types. The implementation likely
    involves checking various conditions and applying game-specific rules to determine
    valid targets.
  warnings: Improper handling of target selection can lead to incorrect targeting,
    potentially causing spells to target the wrong objects or fail to target any at
    all. This method should be used carefully in conjunction with other spell processing
    methods.
