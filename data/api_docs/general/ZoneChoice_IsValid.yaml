  class: ZoneChoice
  method: IsValid
  signature: bool ZoneChoice::IsValid() const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the zone choice data is in a consistent and usable state.
  description: The IsValid method checks if the ZoneChoice object contains valid data
    and is in a consistent state for use within the TrinityCore framework. This validation
    typically ensures that required fields such as zone identifiers, choice indices,
    or related flags are properly initialized and within acceptable ranges. The method
    is commonly used before processing zone-specific choices in player interaction
    systems, such as quest rewards, teleportation options, or zone-specific UI elements.
    It helps prevent runtime errors caused by malformed or uninitialized zone choice
    data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ZoneChoice object contains valid and consistent data;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false typically indicates that the
    object was not properly initialized or contains invalid values that would cause
    issues during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "ZoneChoice choice;\n// ... initialize choice ...\nif (choice.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with zone choice processing\n    ProcessZoneChoice(choice);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid choice\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Invalid zone\
      \ choice detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Quest Reward Context
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nQuestRewardChoice rewardChoice = ...;\nZoneChoice\
      \ zoneChoice = ZoneChoice::FromQuestReward(player, rewardChoice);\n\nif (zoneChoice.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Apply zone-specific effects\n    player->TeleportTo(zoneChoice.GetTargetMap(),\
      \ zoneChoice.GetPosition());\n} else {\n    // Fallback to default behavior\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Invalid zone choice selected.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented with lightweight checks that avoid expensive
    operations. It's recommended to call IsValid() before performing any operations
    on a ZoneChoice object to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior. The
    validation logic may vary depending on the specific implementation of ZoneChoice,
    but generally includes checking for null pointers, valid map IDs, and proper range
    constraints.
  warnings: Calling methods on an invalid ZoneChoice object (where IsValid() returns
    false) can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. Always validate before using
    any zone choice data in critical game systems like teleportation or quest progression.
