  class: UpdateFetcher
  method: ReadSQLUpdate
  signature: std::string UpdateFetcher::ReadSQLUpdate(const Path & file) const
documentation:
  brief: Reads and returns the contents of a SQL update file as a string.
  description: The ReadSQLUpdate method reads the complete content of a specified
    SQL update file and returns it as a std::string. This method is typically used
    during database initialization or update processes within the TrinityCore framework
    to load SQL scripts that define schema changes or data modifications. The method
    expects a valid file path to be provided through the class's internal state, and
    it will throw an exception if the file cannot be opened or read. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with database update mechanisms where SQL scripts need to
    be executed in sequence during server startup or maintenance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the complete contents of the SQL update file.
    If the file cannot be read, an exception will be thrown rather than returning
    an empty string.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to read a SQL update file
    code: 'UpdateFetcher fetcher;

      // Assuming the UpdateFetcher has been initialized with a valid file path

      std::string sqlContent = fetcher.ReadSQLUpdate();

      // Process or execute the SQL content as needed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages database schema
    updates in TrinityCore. The method assumes that the file path has already been
    set within the UpdateFetcher instance, possibly through a constructor or setter
    method. It's important to ensure proper error handling when dealing with file
    I/O operations.
  warnings: The method may throw exceptions if the file cannot be accessed or read.
    Ensure appropriate exception handling is in place. Also, be aware that reading
    large SQL files into memory could impact performance and memory usage.
