  method: Execute
  signature: ActionResult AttackAction::Execute(BotAI * ai, const ActionContext &
    context)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the attack action for a bot AI, determining and performing the appropriate
    combat behavior.
  description: The Execute method of the AttackAction class is responsible for carrying
    out the core logic of an attack action within the TrinityCore bot AI system. It
    evaluates the current context and state of the bot and its target to determine
    the most effective combat approach. This includes selecting the proper attack
    type, checking for valid targets, ensuring the bot has sufficient resources (such
    as mana or energy), and executing the chosen attack sequence. The method integrates
    with the broader AI decision-making framework to ensure that attacks are performed
    in a strategic and context-aware manner.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ActionResult enum value indicating whether the attack was successfully
    executed, failed due to conditions, or requires further processing. Possible values
    may include SUCCESS, FAILED, or NEEDS_DELAY depending on the outcome of the action
    execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Execution
    code: "ActionResult result = attackAction.Execute(ai, context);\nif (result ==\
      \ ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Attack was successfully executed\n    ai->GetBot()->GetAI()->SetNextAction(\"\
      attack\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the AI's action queue processing.
    It assumes that all preconditions for attacking (e.g., valid target, sufficient
    resources) have been checked prior to execution. The method may perform checks
    for line-of-sight, range, and target validity before proceeding with the actual
    attack.
  warnings: Improper handling of the ActionResult return value can lead to incorrect
    AI behavior or infinite loops in action processing. Ensure that all possible return
    states are properly handled to avoid unexpected outcomes.
