documentation:
  brief: Destroys an EconomyManager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the EconomyManager class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an EconomyManager
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    economy system, this may involve releasing references to currency data structures,
    transaction logs, or other financial tracking components. The destructor typically
    does not require any special preconditions as it is automatically invoked by the
    C++ runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of EconomyManager instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    EconomyManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when manager goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of EconomyManager pointer
    code: 'EconomyManager* manager = new EconomyManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers destructor

      manager = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this method
    should not be called directly unless you're managing memory manually. The EconomyManager
    class likely handles cleanup of internal data structures such as currency caches,
    transaction queues, or database connections.
  warnings: Do not call the destructor directly unless you are explicitly managing
    memory for a dynamically allocated object. The destructor should only be invoked
    by the C++ runtime during normal object destruction. Calling it manually can lead
    to undefined behavior if other code still references the object's members.
