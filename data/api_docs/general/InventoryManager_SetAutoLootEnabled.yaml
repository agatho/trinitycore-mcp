  class: InventoryManager
  method: SetAutoLootEnabled
  signature: void InventoryManager::SetAutoLootEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the auto-loot feature for the player's inventory.
  description: The SetAutoLootEnabled method controls whether the player's inventory
    automatically loots items from defeated creatures. When enabled, items will be
    automatically added to the player's inventory without requiring manual interaction.
    When disabled, players must manually loot items from corpses. This functionality
    is commonly used in automated scripts or when players want to control loot distribution
    manually. The setting affects only the current player session and does not persist
    across server restarts unless explicitly saved by game logic.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean value indicating whether auto-loot should be enabled (true)
      or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Loot
    code: player->GetSession()->GetInventoryManager()->SetAutoLootEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto-Loot Conditionally
    code: "if (player->HasAura(SPELL_ID_AUTO_LOOT_DISABLE))\n{\n    player->GetSession()->GetInventoryManager()->SetAutoLootEnabled(false);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    player->GetSession()->GetInventoryManager()->SetAutoLootEnabled(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the InventoryManager, which is
    typically associated with a player session. Changes made through this method are
    not persisted to the database and will reset upon logout or server restart. The
    implementation likely interacts with the player's loot settings and may affect
    how loot is processed during combat.
  warnings: Be cautious when disabling auto-loot in automated scripts, as it may interfere
    with quest progression or loot distribution systems that depend on automatic looting.
    Ensure that manual looting is handled properly if auto-loot is disabled.
