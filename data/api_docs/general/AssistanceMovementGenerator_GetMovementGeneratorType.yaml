documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for assistance behavior.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique integer identifier
    associated with the AssistanceMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used
    internally by TrinityCore's AI system to distinguish different types of movement
    generators during pathfinding and behavior execution. The returned value typically
    corresponds to a predefined enum or constant that represents the specific movement
    type, allowing the game engine to properly route and manage NPC movement behaviors
    based on their current AI state.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for assistance
    behavior. This value is used by the AI system to categorize and process different
    movement patterns in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Movement Generator Type
    code: "AssistanceMovementGenerator assistGen;\nint type = assistGen.GetMovementGeneratorType();\n\
      if (type == MOVEMENTGENERATOR_TYPE_ASSISTANCE)\n{\n    // Handle assistance\
      \ movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision making processes to determine
    how an NPC should move in response to assistance requests. The return value is
    constant for the lifetime of the object and should not change after initialization.
