  class: DamageInfo
  method: GetSchoolMask
  signature: int DamageInfo::GetSchoolMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the damage school mask associated with the damage information.
  description: The GetSchoolMask method retrieves the school mask that represents
    the damage type(s) for a given DamageInfo object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    damage types are categorized using school masks which are bit flags representing
    different damage types such as physical, holy, fire, nature, frost, shadow, and
    arcane. This method allows scripts and systems to determine what kind of damage
    is being processed, enabling proper handling of damage interactions, resistances,
    and effects based on the damage school. The returned value is a bitmask where
    each bit corresponds to a specific damage school, allowing multiple schools to
    be represented simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the school mask of the damage. Each bit in the
    integer corresponds to a specific damage school (e.g., physical, holy, fire, etc.).
    Multiple schools can be combined using bitwise OR operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "DamageInfo* damageInfo = new DamageInfo();\nint schoolMask = damageInfo->GetSchoolMask();\n\
      if (schoolMask & DAMAGE_SCHOOL_MASK_FIRE)\n{\n    // Handle fire damage\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Schools
    code: "DamageInfo* damageInfo = new DamageInfo();\nint schoolMask = damageInfo->GetSchoolMask();\n\
      if (schoolMask & (DAMAGE_SCHOOL_MASK_FIRE | DAMAGE_SCHOOL_MASK_FROST))\n{\n\
      \    // Handle both fire and frost damage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The school mask returned by this method is typically used in conjunction
    with other damage-related APIs to determine how damage should be processed, modified,
    or resisted. It's important to note that the mask may contain multiple bits set
    if the damage originates from multiple sources or types.
