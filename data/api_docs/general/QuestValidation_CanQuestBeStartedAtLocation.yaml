  class: QuestValidation
  method: CanQuestBeStartedAtLocation
  signature: bool QuestValidation::CanQuestBeStartedAtLocation(uint32 questId, const
    int & location)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can start a specific quest at a given location.
  description: The CanQuestBeStartedAtLocation method evaluates if a player is eligible
    to begin a specified quest based on their current location. This validation checks
    various location-based requirements such as zone restrictions, area triggers,
    and quest gating mechanics that prevent players from starting quests outside of
    appropriate environments. The method typically integrates with the game's quest
    system to ensure logical progression and prevent exploits related to quest initiation
    in invalid locations.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate for starting at the
      specified location. Must correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: location
    description: The location identifier where the quest attempt is being made. This
      typically represents a zone, area, or specific map coordinate that determines
      eligibility.
  returns: Returns true if the player can start the specified quest at the given location,
    false otherwise. The method returns false when location restrictions prevent quest
    initiation, such as attempting to start a zone-specific quest outside of its designated
    area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation Check
    code: "if (QuestValidation::CanQuestBeStartedAtLocation(12345, player->GetZoneId()))\
      \ {\n    // Player can start the quest\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Quest cannot be started at current location\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You cannot start this quest here.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Location-Based Validation
    code: "uint32 currentZone = player->GetZoneId();\nuint32 questId = 67890;\nif\
      \ (QuestValidation::CanQuestBeStartedAtLocation(questId, currentZone)) {\n \
      \   if (player->GetQuestStatus(questId) == QUEST_STATUS_NONE) {\n        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendGossipMenu(12345,\
      \ player->GetGUID());\n    }\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid location case\n\
      \    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"This quest is not available in your current\
      \ area.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely performs database lookups to verify quest location requirements
    and may cache results for performance. It's commonly used during gossip interactions
    or quest acceptance events to validate player eligibility before allowing quest
    initiation.
  warnings: Ensure that the location parameter corresponds to a valid zone or area
    identifier; invalid identifiers may cause unexpected behavior or database errors.
    This method should not be used as a sole validation mechanism for quest progression,
    as additional checks like quest state and player level requirements are typically
    needed.
