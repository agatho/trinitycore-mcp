documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to the voice on append structure.
  description: The Append method is responsible for adding channel notification data
    into the VoiceOnAppend structure. This method is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation, where it handles voice
    chat or channel-related notifications. The method takes a reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet and incorporates its contents into the internal data structure of the VoiceOnAppend
    class. It serves as part of the communication pipeline for handling in-game channel
    events such as join/leave messages, whispers, or other channel-based interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Append method
    code: 'VoiceOnAppend voiceOnAppend;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      // Populate notifyPacket with relevant data

      voiceOnAppend.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for managing voice chat or
    channel notifications in TrinityCore. The internal structure of VoiceOnAppend
    and how it processes the ChannelNotify packet may depend on the specific implementation
    details of the server's communication layer.
