  class: Item
  method: SetContainedIn
  signature: void Item::SetContainedIn(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the container GUID for an item, indicating where the item is stored.
  description: The SetContainedIn method assigns a container GUID to an item, which
    determines where the item is located within the game world. This method is typically
    used when an item is placed inside another item or container, such as a bag or
    a mailbox. It updates the item's internal state to reflect its new location in
    the inventory system. The method ensures that the item's container information
    is properly maintained and can be accessed by other systems or scripts.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The GUID of the container where the item is stored. This value represents
      the unique identifier of the container object, such as a bag or mailbox, that
      holds the item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetContainedIn(12345);

      // The item is now contained in container with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the item's internal state
    and may influence how other systems interact with the item. It is recommended
    to ensure that the container GUID corresponds to a valid container object before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Improper use of SetContainedIn can lead to incorrect inventory tracking
    or even crashes if the GUID refers to an invalid container. Always verify that
    the container exists and is valid before setting the contained-in relationship.
