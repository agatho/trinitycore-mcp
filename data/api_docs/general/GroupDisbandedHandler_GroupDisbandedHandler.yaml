documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player's group is disbanded in the game world
  description: The GroupDisbandedHandler method is responsible for managing the cleanup
    and state updates that occur when a player's group is disbanded. This typically
    happens when the group leader leaves the group, or when all members of the group
    have left. The handler ensures that any bot AI associated with the group is properly
    notified and updated to reflect the new group status. It may also handle reassignment
    of bots to new groups or reset their behavior patterns accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Context
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnGroupDisbanded()\n{\n    GroupDisbandedHandler handler(this);\n\
      \    // Handler performs cleanup and state management\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the TrinityCore AI system's event
    handling mechanism. It assumes that the BotAI object passed to it has been properly
    initialized and maintains valid references to group data structures.
  warnings: Improper handling of this event can lead to dangling references or inconsistent
    bot behavior. Ensure that any cleanup performed by this handler does not interfere
    with other systems relying on group membership information.
