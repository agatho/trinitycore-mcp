  class: ResourceEvent
  method: PowerChanged
  signature: ResourceEvent ResourceEvent::PowerChanged(int player, Powers type, int32
    amt, int32 max)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a ResourceEvent object indicating a player's power change.
  description: The PowerChanged method is used to generate a ResourceEvent that represents
    a change in a player's resource (such as mana, rage, or energy). This event is
    typically triggered when a player's power amount is modified through gameplay
    actions like spell casting, attacking, or gaining resource from abilities. The
    method takes the player identifier, power type, and the amount of change as parameters
    to construct the event object. It serves as a core mechanism for tracking and
    responding to resource modifications in the game state.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose power is being changed.
      This value should correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  - name: type
    description: The type of power being modified, represented as a Powers enum value.
      Common values include POWER_MANA, POWER_RAGE, POWER_ENERGY, etc.
  - name: amt
    description: The amount of change to the player's power. Positive values indicate
      power gain, while negative values indicate power loss.
  - name: max
    description: The maximum possible value for the specified power type. This parameter
      defines the upper bound of the resource.
  returns: Returns a ResourceEvent object that encapsulates the details of the power
    change, including the player ID, power type, amount changed, and maximum value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Power Change Event
    code: ResourceEvent event = ResourceEvent::PowerChanged(12345, POWER_MANA, 50,
      1000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Power Loss Event
    code: ResourceEvent event = ResourceEvent::PowerChanged(67890, POWER_RAGE, -25,
      100);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the game's event system to notify subsystems
    about resource changes. It should be called whenever a player's power value is
    modified through gameplay mechanics. The returned ResourceEvent can be queued
    or processed by other systems that respond to resource changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID corresponds to an actual player in the game
    world, as invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior. Also, make sure that the power
    type is valid and supported by the game's current implementation.
