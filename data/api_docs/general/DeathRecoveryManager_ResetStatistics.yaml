  signature: void DeathRecoveryManager::ResetStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all death recovery statistics for the DeathRecoveryManager instance.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears and initializes all internal death
    recovery tracking data within the DeathRecoveryManager. This includes resetting
    counters, timers, and any accumulated statistics related to player deaths and
    recovery events. The method is typically invoked when a new game session begins
    or when statistics need to be cleared for administrative purposes. It ensures
    that subsequent death events are tracked from a clean state without any previous
    data interference.

  - title: Resetting Death Recovery Statistics
    code: 'DeathRecoveryManager* manager = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayer(guid)->GetDeathRecoveryManager();

      manager->ResetStatistics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it will erase all current death
    recovery data, potentially affecting gameplay mechanics that depend on historical
    death statistics. It's recommended to call this only during session initialization
    or when explicitly resetting player progress.
