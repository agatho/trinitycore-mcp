  class: GameObjectModel
  method: initialize
  signature: bool GameObjectModel::initialize(int modelOwner, const int & dataPath)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the GameObjectModel with the specified model owner and data path.
  description: The initialize method sets up the GameObjectModel by associating it
    with a specific model owner and configuring its data path. This method is typically
    called during the construction or setup phase of a game object to ensure that
    the model is properly initialized with the correct owner and resource location.
    It performs necessary internal setup operations to prepare the model for rendering
    or interaction within the TrinityCore framework. The method returns true upon
    successful initialization, or false if the initialization fails due to invalid
    parameters or resource issues.
  parameters:
  - name: modelOwner
    description: An integer identifier representing the owner of the model. This typically
      corresponds to a GameObject's unique identifier (GUID) that owns this model
      instance.
  - name: dataPath
    description: A reference to an integer representing the data path identifier for
      the model resources. This value is used internally by TrinityCore to locate
      and load the appropriate model files from the game data directories.
  returns: Returns true if the GameObjectModel was successfully initialized with the
    provided parameters, false otherwise. Initialization may fail if the model owner
    is invalid or if the data path cannot be resolved.
  examples:
  - title: Basic initialization of a GameObjectModel
    code: "GameObjectModel model;\nint ownerGuid = 12345;\nint dataPathId = 67890;\n\
      bool success = model.initialize(ownerGuid, dataPathId);\nif (success) {\n  \
      \  // Model initialized successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the creation or loading of GameObject
    instances in TrinityCore. It's important to ensure that the modelOwner and dataPath
    parameters are valid before calling this method, as invalid values may lead to
    undefined behavior or failed initialization.
  warnings: Calling initialize on an already initialized GameObjectModel may result
    in unexpected behavior or resource leaks. Always verify that the model is in a
    clean state before invoking this method.
