  class: Battleground
  method: GetWinner
  signature: int Battleground::GetWinner() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the winning team ID of the battleground.
  description: The GetWinner method retrieves the identifier of the team that has
    won the current battleground instance. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    battlegrounds are structured with two teams (Alliance and Horde), typically represented
    by team IDs 0 and 1 respectively. This method is commonly used to determine the
    outcome of a battleground match after it has concluded. The return value indicates
    which faction has emerged victorious, or may return -1 if no winner has been determined
    yet (e.g., during an ongoing match or before the battleground has started).
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the winning team ID (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde),
    or -1 if no winner is determined.
  examples:
  - title: Check battleground winner after match ends
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    int winner = bg->GetWinner();\n    if (winner == 0)\n        sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_WIN_ALLIANCE);\n\
      \    else if (winner == 1)\n        sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_WIN_HORDE);\n\
      \    else\n        sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_NOT_ENDED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the battleground has ended. Calling
    it during an active match may return unexpected results or -1 if no team has won
    yet.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-negative return value indicates a completed match;
    always verify the battleground state before relying on this result.
