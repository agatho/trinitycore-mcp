documentation:
  brief: Removes stale or outdated bot data from the population manager's internal
    tracking structures.
  description: The CleanupStaleData method is responsible for identifying and removing
    outdated or invalid bot entries from the BotPopulationManager's tracking systems.
    This process typically involves checking for bots that have been inactive for
    a specified duration, have reached their maximum lifetime, or have otherwise become
    obsolete within the game environment. The method ensures that the population manager
    maintains accurate and up-to-date records of active bots, preventing memory leaks
    and maintaining optimal performance. It is commonly invoked during periodic maintenance
    cycles or when the system detects an accumulation of stale data that could impact
    overall system efficiency.

    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    botPopulationManager.CleanupStaleData();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically to maintain system health. It may
    involve database operations or in-memory cleanup, so performance impact should
    be considered during high-traffic periods. The exact criteria for what constitutes
    'stale' data is implementation-specific and typically configurable.
