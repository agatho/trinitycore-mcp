  class: Spell
  method: SelectImplicitDestDestTargets
  signature: void Spell::SelectImplicitDestDestTargets(const SpellEffectInfo & spellEffectInfo,
    const SpellImplicitTargetInfo & targetType, int targetIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Selects implicit destination target for spell effects based on spell effect
    information and target type.
  description: This method determines and selects the appropriate destination targets
    for spell effects by analyzing the provided spell effect information and target
    type. It processes the target index to identify valid target destinations, considering
    various game mechanics such as target selection rules, spatial constraints, and
    spell-specific requirements. The method is crucial for proper spell execution
    and target validation in TrinityCore's spell system, ensuring that spells are
    cast correctly with appropriate target selection.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains detailed information about the spell effect including effect
      type, radius, and other parameters that influence target selection
  - name: targetType
    description: Specifies the implicit target type for the spell effect, determining
      how targets are selected based on game rules and constraints
  - name: targetIndex
    description: The index of the target being processed, used to determine which
      specific target from multiple possible targets to select
  returns: null

    code: 'Spell::SelectImplicitDestDestTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, targetIndex);

      // This method is typically called internally during spell cast processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell processing system and should not
    be directly called from external code. It handles target selection logic that
    depends on complex game mechanics including spatial requirements, target type
    validation, and spell-specific constraints.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code as it's designed
    for internal spell processing. Incorrect usage may lead to invalid target selections
    or spell execution failures.
