  method: GetRelevanceScore
  signature: float Action::GetRelevanceScore() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the relevance score of this action for the current
    AI context.
  description: The GetRelevanceScore method computes a floating-point value that represents
    how relevant or important this action is within the current artificial intelligence
    decision-making context. This score is typically used by AI systems to prioritize
    actions, with higher scores indicating greater relevance. The calculation may
    consider factors such as target distance, threat level, available resources, and
    other contextual variables specific to the AI's current state. This method is
    commonly called during AI decision-making cycles to determine which action should
    be executed next among a set of possible actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the relevance score of this action. Higher values
    indicate greater relevance or priority. The exact range and interpretation may
    vary based on implementation details, but typically ranges from 0.0 (least relevant)
    to 1.0 (most relevant), though values outside this range may be possible.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float score = action->GetRelevanceScore();\nif (score > 0.7f)\n{\n    //\
      \ Execute the action\n    action->Execute();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing multiple actions for selection
    code: "Action* bestAction = nullptr;\nfloat bestScore = -1.0f;\n\nfor (auto& action\
      \ : availableActions)\n{\n    float score = action->GetRelevanceScore();\n \
      \   if (score > bestScore)\n    {\n        bestScore = score;\n        bestAction\
      \ = action;\n    }\n}\n\nif (bestAction && bestScore > 0.0f)\n{\n    bestAction->Execute();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI update cycles, so performance
    considerations are important. The relevance score calculation may involve complex
    logic and should be optimized for real-time execution. The exact implementation
    details of how the score is calculated are not exposed in this API.
  warnings: The returned value is context-dependent and may change between calls.
    Do not cache the result unless you understand the implications of using stale
    data. Ensure that actions with zero or negative relevance scores are handled appropriately
    to avoid unintended behavior.
