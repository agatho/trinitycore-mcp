documentation:
  brief: Initializes the script reload manager for handling dynamic script reloading
    in the TrinityCore server.
  description: The ScriptReloadMgr constructor initializes the script reload manager,
    setting up internal data structures and state required for managing dynamic script
    reloading during runtime. This method is typically called during server startup
    or when initializing the scripting subsystem. It prepares the manager to handle
    various script reload operations such as reloading AI scripts, creature scripts,
    game object scripts, and other scripted components without requiring a full server
    restart. The initialization process ensures that all necessary resources are allocated
    and that the manager is ready to respond to reload commands issued by administrators
    or through in-game mechanisms.

  - title: Initialization of ScriptReloadMgr
    code: 'ScriptReloadMgr reloadMgr;

      // The constructor automatically initializes the manager

      // No explicit initialization call needed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method, so it should be called as part of object instantiation
    rather than as a standalone function. The manager may perform resource allocation
    and setup operations during construction that are essential for proper script
    reloading functionality.
