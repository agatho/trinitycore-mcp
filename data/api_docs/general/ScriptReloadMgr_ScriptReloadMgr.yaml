documentation:
  brief: Moves a ScriptReloadMgr object to another ScriptReloadMgr object, transferring
    ownership of its resources.
  description: The ScriptReloadMgr move constructor transfers the internal state and
    resources from one ScriptReloadMgr instance to another. This operation is typically
    used when moving objects between scopes or containers to avoid unnecessary copying.
    The moved-from object will be left in a valid but unspecified state. In the context
    of TrinityCore, this method supports efficient resource management during script
    reloading operations where ScriptReloadMgr instances may need to be transferred
    between different parts of the system without duplicating internal data structures.

  - title: Move Constructing a ScriptReloadMgr
    code: 'ScriptReloadMgr mgr1;

      // ... perform operations ...

      ScriptReloadMgr mgr2 = std::move(mgr1); // Move constructor in action

      // mgr1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed for efficient
    resource transfer rather than duplication. The moved-from object should not be
    used after the move operation.
