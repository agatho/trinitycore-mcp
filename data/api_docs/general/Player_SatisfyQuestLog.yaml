  brief: Satisfies the player's quest log by marking all active quests as completed
  description: The SatisfyQuestLog method is used to complete all active quests in
    a player's quest log. This method typically sets the quest status to completed
    for all quests currently assigned to the player, effectively removing them from
    the active quest list. It is commonly used during quest completion or when a player
    needs to be marked as having completed all available quests. The method returns
    true if the operation was successful, indicating that all quests were properly
    satisfied.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all quests in the player's quest log were successfully
    satisfied, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player = new Player();\nbool result = player->SatisfyQuestLog(true);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // All quests are now completed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to ensure proper quest completion. It may affect the player's quest status and
    should be used carefully during quest progression.
  warnings: Using this method without proper consideration can lead to incorrect quest
    status updates, potentially causing issues with quest progression or reward distribution.
