  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: GetEnergyCostCache
  signature: int & ResourceCalculator::GetEnergyCostCache()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the cached energy cost value used for resource calculations
    in World of Warcraft spell and ability systems.
  description: The GetEnergyCostCache method provides access to a precomputed energy
    cost value that is typically used in conjunction with spell and ability resource
    management within the TrinityCore framework. This cached value represents the
    energy cost associated with a specific action or spell, allowing for efficient
    lookup without repeated calculations. The method returns a reference to an integer
    value, which can be directly modified if needed, making it suitable for dynamic
    adjustments during gameplay. This caching mechanism is particularly useful in
    performance-critical scenarios such as spell casting, ability usage, and resource
    deduction logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the cached energy cost value. The
    returned value can be modified directly, and changes will persist in the cache
    for subsequent calls.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Energy Cost Cache
    code: 'ResourceCalculator calculator;

      int& energyCost = calculator.GetEnergyCostCache();

      energyCost = 50; // Modify cached value

      int currentCost = calculator.GetEnergyCostCache(); // Retrieve updated value'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Cached Energy Cost in Spell Logic
    code: "ResourceCalculator calculator;\nPlayer* player = ...;\nint& cost = calculator.GetEnergyCostCache();\n\
      if (player->GetPower(POWER_ENERGY) >= cost)\n{\n    player->ModifyPower(POWER_ENERGY,\
      \ -cost);\n    // Proceed with spell casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to a cached value that may be shared across
    multiple instances or contexts. Modifications to this value affect all references
    pointing to it. This method is typically used in performance-sensitive code paths
    where repeated calculation of energy costs would be inefficient.
  warnings: Modifying the returned reference directly affects the cached value for
    all subsequent uses. Be cautious when modifying values that may be shared across
    different systems or threads. Ensure thread safety if this method is called from
    multiple execution contexts.
