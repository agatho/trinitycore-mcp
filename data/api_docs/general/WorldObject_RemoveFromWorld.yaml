  method: RemoveFromWorld
  signature: void WorldObject::RemoveFromWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the WorldObject from the world environment, making it invisible and
    inaccessible to players and creatures.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method removes a WorldObject from the active world
    state, effectively taking it out of the game's world simulation. This action prevents
    the object from being interacted with by players or AI, and ensures that it no
    longer appears in the game world. The method is typically used when an object
    needs to be temporarily or permanently removed from gameplay, such as during creature
    death, object destruction, or when transitioning between zones. It also ensures
    that the object's position is no longer updated in the world, preventing further
    interactions with other objects or players.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void RemoveFromWorld() {\n    // This method is called on a WorldObject\n\
      \    // to remove it from the world\n    this->RemoveFromWorld();\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method does not destroy the object itself; it simply removes it from
    the world's active state. The object may still be referenced in memory and can
    be re-added to the world later if needed. This method is often used in conjunction
    with other methods like AddToWorld or RemoveFromMap to manage object lifecycle
    within the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already removed object may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. It's important to ensure that the object is not already removed
    before calling this method. Additionally, removing objects from the world should
    be done carefully as it can affect gameplay mechanics and potentially cause issues
    with AI behavior or player interactions.
