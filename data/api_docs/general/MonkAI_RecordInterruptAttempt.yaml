  class: MonkAI
  method: RecordInterruptAttempt
  signature: void MonkAI::RecordInterruptAttempt(int * target, int spellId, bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records an attempt to interrupt a spell cast by a target unit.
  description: The RecordInterruptAttempt method logs information about a successful
    or failed attempt to interrupt a spell being cast by a target unit. This method
    is typically used within the Monk AI system to track combat interactions and spell
    interruption mechanics. It updates internal tracking data that may be used for
    AI decision-making, cooldown management, or logging purposes. The method accepts
    a pointer to the target unit, the spell ID of the interrupted spell, and a boolean
    indicating whether the interruption was successful.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit whose spell casting is being interrupted.
      This parameter represents the unit that was casting the spell at the time of
      interruption attempt.
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell being interrupted. This value corresponds
      to the Spell ID in the game's database and uniquely identifies the specific
      spell being interrupted.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the interruption attempt was successful.
      True indicates successful interruption, false indicates failure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Attempt Recording
    code: 'MonkAI* ai = ...;

      Unit* target = ...;

      int spellId = 12345;

      ai->RecordInterruptAttempt(&target, spellId, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Failed Interrupt Attempt
    code: 'MonkAI* ai = ...;

      Unit* target = ...;

      int spellId = 67890;

      ai->RecordInterruptAttempt(&target, spellId, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters or tracking structures within
    the MonkAI class to maintain state about recent interrupt attempts. It may be
    used in conjunction with other AI decision-making logic to determine when and
    how to attempt spell interruptions based on previous success/failure patterns.
