documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's versatility damage done values based on current stats
    and equipment.
  description: The UpdateVersatilityDamageDone method recalculates and applies the
    player's versatility damage bonuses to their attack power and spell power. This
    method is typically invoked when the player's stats, gear, or buffs change, ensuring
    that versatility effects are properly reflected in combat calculations. The method
    updates internal damage multipliers used during damage computations, affecting
    both melee and spell damage output. It may be called automatically by the game
    engine upon stat changes or manually by scripts requiring immediate stat synchronization.

  - title: Manual Update Call
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateVersatilityDamageDone();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal player damage multipliers and should
    only be called when stat changes have occurred. It's typically invoked by the
    game engine automatically, but can be manually triggered in custom scripts or
    during gear swaps.
