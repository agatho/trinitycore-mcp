  method: ResetMetrics
  signature: void InteractionValidator::ResetMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all interaction metrics tracked by the InteractionValidator instance.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears and initializes all internal counters
    and statistics related to player interactions validated by this InteractionValidator
    object. This method is typically invoked when starting a new validation session
    or when resetting accumulated data to ensure accurate tracking of subsequent interactions.
    The operation does not affect the validator's configuration or state, only the
    collected metrics. It ensures that any previously recorded interaction data is
    cleared before new validation cycles begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InteractionValidator validator;

      validator.ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating a new set of interaction validations
    to ensure clean metric tracking. It is not thread-safe and should be used in a
    controlled environment where no concurrent validation operations are occurring.
  warnings: Calling ResetMetrics during active validation sessions may lead to inconsistent
    or incorrect metric reporting. Ensure all ongoing validations are completed before
    invoking this method.
