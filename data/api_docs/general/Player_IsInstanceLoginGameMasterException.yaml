  signature: bool Player::IsInstanceLoginGameMasterException() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is exempt from instance login restrictions.
  description: This method checks if the player has Game Master privileges that exempt
    them from instance login restrictions. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    certain GM accounts may be allowed to enter instances even when they would normally
    be restricted due to level requirements or other limitations. This typically applies
    to GMs who need to test content or perform administrative tasks within instances.
    The check is performed against the player's current account permissions and GM
    status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has Game Master exception privileges for instance
    login, false otherwise. This indicates whether the player can bypass normal instance
    entry restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Check Instance Login Exception Status
    code: "if (player->IsInstanceLoginGameMasterException()) {\n    // Player is exempt\
      \ from instance login restrictions\n    player->TeleportTo(1, 0, 0, 0, 0); //\
      \ Example: Teleport to instance\n} else {\n    // Player must follow normal\
      \ instance entry rules\n    player->SendNotification(\"You cannot enter this\
      \ instance.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks the player's account permissions and GM status
    flags. It may be used in conjunction with other instance-related methods to determine
    access rights. The implementation probably involves checking if the player's account
    has specific GM privileges enabled.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method for access control, as it bypasses normal
    game restrictions. Ensure that only appropriate GM accounts are granted these
    exceptions to prevent abuse of instance entry.
