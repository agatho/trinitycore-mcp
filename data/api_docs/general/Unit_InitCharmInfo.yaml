documentation:
  brief: Initialize and return a new CharmInfo structure for managing pet behavior.
  description: The InitCharmInfo method creates and initializes a new CharmInfo object
    that manages the behavior and state of a summoned creature or pet. This method
    is typically used when creating a new pet or creature that needs to be controlled
    by a player, ensuring proper initialization of the charm's data structures. The
    method returns a pointer to the newly created CharmInfo structure which can then
    be used to manage various aspects of pet control, such as commands, spells, and
    behavior. This method is essential for proper pet management in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to a newly initialized CharmInfo structure that manages
    pet behavior and control. The returned pointer may be null if initialization fails
    or if the unit does not support charm functionality.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nCharmInfo* charm = unit->InitCharmInfo();\nif (charm\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use charm for pet management\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a unit needs to initialize a charm
    structure. It is typically used in conjunction with other pet management methods
    and should be called before any pet behavior operations are performed.
  warnings: This method should not be called on units that do not support charm functionality,
    as it may result in null pointer dereferences or undefined behavior. Also, this
    method should be called only once per unit to avoid memory leaks or duplicate
    initialization.
