documentation:
  brief: Validates the current quest states for a player to ensure consistency with
    game rules and requirements.
  description: The ValidateQuestStates method checks the validity of all active and
    completed quests for a player, ensuring that quest progress aligns with game mechanics
    and server rules. This method typically runs during quest updates or when a player
    interacts with quest givers to prevent quest state inconsistencies. It verifies
    prerequisites, completion conditions, and ensures that players cannot advance
    quests out of order or bypass required objectives. The validation process may
    trigger updates to the player's quest log, update quest status flags, or reset
    invalid quest progress.

  - title: Basic Quest State Validation

      \ completion;\n    completion.ValidateQuestStates();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    quest-related events. Developers should not need to call this method directly
    unless implementing custom quest validation logic. The method may modify internal
    quest state data structures and should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Calling ValidateQuestStates manually without proper context may cause
    unexpected behavior or quest state corruption. This method is not thread-safe
    and should only be called from the main game thread or within appropriate synchronization
    contexts.
