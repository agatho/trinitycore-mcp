  brief: Moves the spline initialization data from one MoveSplineInit object to another
    using move semantics.
  description: The MoveSplineInit constructor that accepts an rvalue reference to
    another MoveSplineInit object performs a move operation, transferring ownership
    of internal resources and state from the source object to the destination. This
    is a standard C++ move constructor implementation designed for efficient resource
    management in spline-based movement calculations within TrinityCore's pathfinding
    and character movement systems. The method is typically used internally during
    object construction or when reassigning MoveSplineInit instances to avoid unnecessary
    copying of potentially large data structures.

  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init1;

      // ... initialize init1 with movement data ...

      MoveSplineInit init2 = std::move(init1); // Move constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor utilizes move semantics to efficiently transfer resources
    without deep copying. It's important to note that after the move operation, the
    source object should not be used in a meaningful way as its state becomes undefined.
    This is standard behavior for move constructors in C++.
  warnings: After calling this move constructor, the original MoveSplineInit object
    must not be accessed or used, as it will be left in a moved-from state with undefined
    contents. Using the source object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior.
