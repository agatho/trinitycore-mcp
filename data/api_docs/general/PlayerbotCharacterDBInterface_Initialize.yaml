  class: PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the player bot character database interface, setting up required
    connections and data structures for bot character management.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface for
    use by establishing necessary database connections, creating or verifying required
    tables, and initializing internal data structures needed for managing player bot
    characters. This method is typically called during the startup sequence of the
    TrinityCore server when bot functionality is enabled. It ensures that all prerequisites
    are met before any bot character operations can be performed, including validating
    database schema integrity and setting up connection pools. The initialization
    process may involve checking for existing bot data, creating default configurations,
    and preparing transaction handling mechanisms. This method should only be called
    once during the application lifecycle to avoid resource conflicts or duplicate
    initializations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all required components
    were properly set up; returns false if any critical error occurred during the
    setup process, such as database connection failures, schema validation errors,
    or insufficient permissions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface dbInterface;\nbool success = dbInterface.Initialize();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Proceed with bot character operations\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      playerbot\", \"Player bot database interface initialized successfully.\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\"\
      , \"Failed to initialize player bot database interface.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup and should not be invoked
    multiple times. The interface assumes that the underlying database system is already
    configured and accessible. Initialization may take several seconds depending on
    database size and complexity of bot character data structures.
  warnings: Calling Initialize more than once can lead to undefined behavior, resource
    leaks, or inconsistent state. Ensure that all necessary database permissions are
    granted before calling this method. The method will not handle database migration
    automatically; schema updates must be performed separately if needed.
