  method: Hook_OnGroupUpdate
  signature: void GroupHooks::Hook_OnGroupUpdate(Group * group, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates group-related data and handles group events during each game tick.
  description: The Hook_OnGroupUpdate method is a callback function that is invoked
    periodically to process updates for group objects within the TrinityCore framework.
    It is typically called during the game loop's update cycle, allowing mods or extensions
    to perform custom logic on groups, such as tracking member status, managing group
    loot settings, or synchronizing group data with external systems. This method
    receives a pointer to the Group object and the time difference (in milliseconds)
    since the last update, enabling precise timing-based operations. The function
    is part of the GroupHooks system which provides extension points for modifying
    or enhancing standard group behavior without directly altering core TrinityCore
    code.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that needs updating. This parameter must
      not be null and represents a valid group instance in the game world.
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since the last update call for this
      group. Used to calculate time-based events or cooldowns within the group context.
  returns: This method does not return any value (void).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Update Handler
    code: "void MyMod::Hook_OnGroupUpdate(Group* group, uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Example:\
      \ Log group member count\n    sLog->outString(\"Group %u has %u members\", group->GetId(),\
      \ group->GetMembersCount());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Group Update with Time-based Logic
    code: "void MyMod::Hook_OnGroupUpdate(Group* group, uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (group->IsLootMaster())\n\
      \    {\n        // Example: Process loot settings every 5 seconds\n        static\
      \ uint32 lootTimer = 0;\n        lootTimer += diff;\n        if (lootTimer >=\
      \ 5000)\n        {\n            group->UpdateLootSettings();\n            lootTimer\
      \ = 0;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from the main game update loop, so performance considerations
    are important. Avoid heavy computations or blocking operations within this function
    to prevent impacting overall server performance. The group pointer passed in may
    be invalid if the group has been disbanded or deleted during the update cycle.
  warnings: Do not modify the group object directly in this hook unless you are certain
    of the implications, as it might cause race conditions or unexpected behavior.
    Also, ensure that your implementation handles potential null group pointers gracefully,
    though they should typically be valid at the time of invocation.
