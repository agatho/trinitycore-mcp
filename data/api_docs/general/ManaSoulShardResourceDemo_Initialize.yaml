  class: ManaSoulShardResourceDemo
  method: Initialize
  signature: void ManaSoulShardResourceDemo::Initialize(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the mana soul shard resource demo for a player bot.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state and configurations
    required for managing mana soul shards within the context of a player bot. This
    typically involves initializing resource tracking variables, setting up event
    handlers, or preparing data structures needed for the mana soul shard mechanics.
    The method ensures that the bot's mana soul shard system is properly configured
    before any operations involving these resources are performed. It should be called
    once during the bot's initialization phase to ensure proper functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will use the
      mana soul shard resource demo. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'ManaSoulShardResourceDemo demo;

      demo.Initialize(playerBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance. Reinitialization
    may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The player pointer must be valid
    and represent an active bot entity.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the bot parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object is fully initialized before
    calling this method.
