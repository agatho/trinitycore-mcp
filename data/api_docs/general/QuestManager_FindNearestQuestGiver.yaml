  class: QuestManager
  method: FindNearestQuestGiver
  signature: Creature * QuestManager::FindNearestQuestGiver() const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the nearest quest giver creature within the player's current
    map.
  description: The FindNearestQuestGiver method searches for the closest Creature
    object that serves as a quest giver in the same map as the calling entity. It
    iterates through all creatures in the current map and calculates the distance
    to each one, returning the creature with the shortest distance that is valid for
    quest interaction. This method is typically used by players or NPCs to locate
    nearby quest givers for quest acceptance, turn-in, or progression. The search
    only considers creatures that are within the same map instance and are not in
    an invalid state (e.g., dead or despawned).
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a Creature object representing the nearest quest giver, or
    nullptr if no valid quest giver is found within the current map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player quest interaction
    code: "Creature* questGiver = player->GetQuestManager()->FindNearestQuestGiver();\n\
      if (questGiver)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest interaction\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->ClearMenus();\n\
      \    questGiver->PrepareDialogText(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through creatures in the current map,
    so performance may degrade in maps with many creatures. It is recommended to cache
    results when frequently checking for quest givers in the same area.
  warnings: The returned Creature pointer should always be checked for null before
    use, as the method may return nullptr if no valid quest giver exists in the current
    map. Also, this method only searches within the same map instance and does not
    account for different phases or instances.
