documentation:
  brief: Unloads all data associated with the grid map, freeing memory and resources.
  description: The GridMap::unloadData method is responsible for releasing all memory
    and resources that are currently allocated for a specific grid map instance. This
    includes deallocating terrain data, object references, and any other internal
    structures that represent the grid's contents. The method ensures that no memory
    leaks occur when a grid map is no longer needed, such as when a player leaves
    a zone or when the server shuts down. It is typically called internally by the
    game engine during cleanup operations, but may also be invoked manually in specific
    scenarios where explicit resource management is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in grid cleanup
    code: "GridMap* map = sGridMapMgr->GetGridMap(0, 0);\nif (map)\n{\n    map->unloadData();\n\
      \    // Grid map data is now freed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the grid map is no longer in use to
    prevent dangling references. It's important to ensure that all references to objects
    within this grid are cleared before calling unloadData, as the method does not
    perform any reference checking.
  warnings: Calling unloadData on a grid map that is still actively being used by
    the game engine can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that
    no active players or objects are present in the grid before invoking this method.
