  method: ExecuteGuildEvent
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::ExecuteGuildEvent(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a guild event by its unique identifier, triggering associated actions
    and updates within the guild system.
  description: 'The ExecuteGuildEvent method is responsible for processing and activating
    a specific guild event based on its unique identifier. This method typically handles
    the logic for events such as guild achievements, member promotions, or other coordinated
    guild activities. It ensures that all relevant subsystems are notified and updated
    accordingly. The method operates within the context of TrinityCore''s guild management
    system and is usually invoked when a guild event needs to be processed, either
    manually by an administrator or automatically through game mechanics. Precondition:
    The eventId must correspond to a valid registered guild event; Postcondition:
    The event''s associated actions are executed and any necessary state changes are
    applied.'
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: A unique identifier for the guild event to be executed. This value
      should correspond to a registered event in the guild event coordinator system.
      Valid values are positive integers representing registered event IDs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Event Execution
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator* eventCoord = sGuildEventCoordinator;

      eventCoord->ExecuteGuildEvent(1001); // Executes a guild achievement event with
      ID 1001'
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing Event Based on Game Logic
    code: "uint32 eventId = sGuildMgr->GetNextGuildEventId();\nif (eventId > 0)\n\
      {\n    sGuildEventCoordinator->ExecuteGuildEvent(eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the game's event handling system
    or when a guild-related action requires coordination across multiple subsystems.
    It may involve database operations and network communication to update all connected
    clients. The method assumes that the eventId parameter has been validated against
    registered events.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or unregistered eventId may result in undefined behavior
    or silent failure. Ensure eventId corresponds to a valid, registered guild event
    before calling this method. Avoid calling this method from within critical sections
    of code where race conditions might occur.
