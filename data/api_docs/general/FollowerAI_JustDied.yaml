documentation:
  brief: Handles the death event of a follower unit in the game world
  description: The JustDied method is called when a follower unit controlled by FollowerAI
    dies. This method serves as a callback that allows custom behavior to be executed
    upon the death of a follower, such as triggering quest events, updating NPC states,
    or managing follower-related objectives. The method is part of the AI system in
    TrinityCore and is invoked automatically by the game engine when a follower's
    health reaches zero. It provides an opportunity for developers to implement specific
    logic tied to the death of a follower unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Follower Death Handling
    code: "class MyFollowerAI : public FollowerAI {\npublic:\n    void JustDied()\
      \ override {\n        // Trigger quest completion or update NPC state\n    \
      \    if (GetLeaderGuid().HasEntry(12345))\n            GetLeader()->SetQuestStatus(67890,\
      \ QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE);\n        // Perform cleanup\n        CleanupFollower();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core AI system and should
    not be invoked directly. It's important to ensure that any actions taken in this
    method do not cause infinite loops or race conditions, especially when dealing
    with quest states or other world objects.
  warnings: Do not modify the follower's health or state directly within this method
    as it may interfere with the death sequence. Avoid performing heavy operations
    that could block the game loop.
