  signature: MovementGeneratorType Unit::GetDefaultMovementType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the default movement type for a unit.
  description: This method retrieves the default movement generator type assigned
    to a Unit object, which determines how the unit will move by default when no specific
    movement is active. The returned value indicates the type of movement behavior
    that should be applied to the unit under normal circumstances, such as idle, random,
    or targeted movement patterns. This is particularly useful for understanding and
    managing NPC behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a MovementGeneratorType enum value representing the default movement
    type assigned to this unit. Possible values include MGTYPE_IDLE, MGTYPE_RANDOM,
    MGTYPE_TARGETED, MGTYPE_CHASE, MGTYPE_FOLLOW, and others depending on the unit's
    configuration and behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "MovementGeneratorType type = unit->GetDefaultMovementType();\nif (type\
      \ == MGTYPE_IDLE)\n{\n    // Unit is configured for idle movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore to determine default
    behavior for units. It does not directly affect the unit's current movement state
    but provides information about what movement type would be applied if no active
    movement generator is set.
  warnings: Care should be taken when interpreting return values, as different movement
    types may have varying implications for AI behavior and pathfinding in TrinityCore.
    This method should not be used to determine actual movement status of a unit.
