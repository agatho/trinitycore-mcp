api:
  class: EvokerAI
  method: HasEssence
  signature: bool EvokerAI::HasEssence(int required)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the evoker has the specified essence available for use.
  description: The HasEssence method determines whether the EvokerAI instance currently
    possesses a required essence type. This method is typically used within the AI
    logic to evaluate if an evoker can cast a spell or perform an action that requires
    a specific essence resource. The check considers the evoker's current essence
    pool and any restrictions or cooldowns that may prevent usage of the specified
    essence. It serves as a predicate in decision-making processes for spell selection
    and ability execution within the evoker's AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: required
    description: The essence type identifier to check for availability. This value
      typically corresponds to an enum or constant representing different essence
      types such as Life, Death, or other evoker-specific resources.
  returns: Returns true if the evoker has the specified essence available; otherwise
    returns false. The method may return false if the essence is not in the evoker's
    possession, is currently on cooldown, or is otherwise restricted from use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (evokerAI->HasEssence(ESSENCE_LIFE)) {\n    // Perform life essence\
      \ based action\n    evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_LIFE_BURST);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Execution
    code: "if (evokerAI->HasEssence(ESSENCE_DEATH)) {\n    if (evokerAI->GetHealthPercent()\
      \ < 30) {\n        evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_DEATH_SURGE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal essence tracking systems and may
    be affected by cooldowns, resource limitations, or temporary status effects. Developers
    should ensure that the required essence type parameter maps correctly to the expected
    enum values used internally by the evoker AI system.
  warnings: The method may not account for transient states where essence is temporarily
    unavailable due to combat mechanics or spell restrictions. Always validate the
    return value before performing actions that consume essence to prevent invalid
    operations.
