  class: HunterAI
  method: HandleTargetSwitching
  signature: bool HunterAI::HandleTargetSwitching(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter should switch to a new target based on threat
    and combat conditions.
  description: The HandleTargetSwitching method evaluates the current hunting AI's
    target selection logic, determining if the hunter should abandon its existing
    target in favor of a more suitable one. This method typically checks for higher
    threat levels, target validity, or other combat-relevant factors to ensure optimal
    targeting behavior. It is used internally by the HunterAI system during combat
    updates and may influence the hunter's attack selection process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a new target was successfully identified and selected;
    false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that no suitable replacement
    target exists or that the current target remains optimal.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat update
    code: "if (hunterAI->HandleTargetSwitching(nullptr)) {\n    // Target has been\
      \ switched, proceed with new target logic\n    Unit* newTarget = hunterAI->GetTarget();\n\
      \    // Perform actions on the new target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI decision-making loop and should not
    be called directly from external code unless implementing custom AI behavior.
    The method relies on the hunter's current threat table and target validity checks.
  warnings: Do not assume that calling this method will immediately change the hunter's
    target; it only returns a boolean indicating whether a switch is recommended.
    The actual target switching logic may be deferred or subject to additional conditions.
