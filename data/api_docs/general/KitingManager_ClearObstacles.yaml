documentation:
  brief: Clears all registered obstacles from the kiting manager's obstacle list.
  description: The ClearObstacles method removes all previously added obstacles from
    the KitingManager's internal collection of navigational barriers. This method
    is typically invoked when resetting or reinitializing the kiting behavior, ensuring
    that stale obstacle data does not interfere with new pathfinding calculations.
    The operation is immediate and does not require any specific preconditions. After
    execution, the obstacle list will be empty, allowing new obstacles to be registered
    without conflict.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be safely called from any thread context.
    It performs a simple clearing operation on an internal container, making it efficient
    for frequent use during kiting behavior updates.
