  brief: Determines whether the player can apply resilience to their current combat
    state.
  description: The CanApplyResilience method checks if a player is eligible to apply
    resilience effects, which are typically related to damage reduction mechanics
    in World of Warcraft. This method evaluates various conditions such as player
    status, combat state, and resource availability to determine if resilience can
    be applied. It is commonly used in combat calculations and damage mitigation scenarios
    where players need to assess their ability to reduce incoming damage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can apply resilience, false otherwise. The method
    does not return null or error values as it is a boolean check.
  examples:

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related functions
    to determine eligibility for damage reduction mechanics. Performance considerations
    include checking player status and combat state before calling this method.
  warnings: This method should not be called during combat without proper context,
    as it may lead to incorrect damage calculation results if used outside of appropriate
    combat scenarios.
