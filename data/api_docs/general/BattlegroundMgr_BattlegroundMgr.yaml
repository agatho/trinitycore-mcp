documentation:
  brief: Moves a BattlegroundMgr object to another BattlegroundMgr object using move
    semantics.
  description: The BattlegroundMgr move constructor transfers ownership of resources
    from one BattlegroundMgr instance to another. This is a fundamental part of C++'s
    move semantics, allowing efficient resource management when transferring objects.
    In the context of TrinityCore's battleground system, this constructor would typically
    be used internally during object creation or reassignment operations where an
    existing BattlegroundMgr instance needs to be replaced with a new one. The operation
    leaves the source object in a valid but unspecified state, as is standard for
    move constructors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'BattlegroundMgr mgr1;

      // ... initialize mgr1 ...

      BattlegroundMgr mgr2 = std::move(mgr1); // Moves resources from mgr1 to mgr2

      // mgr1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    and should not be called directly in most user code. The move constructor enables
    efficient resource transfer without deep copying, which is crucial for performance
    in battleground management systems that may handle many concurrent battleground
    instances.
