  brief: Determines whether the player has reached the maximum level in the game.
  description: The IsMaxLevel method checks if a player character has achieved the
    highest possible level in World of Warcraft, which is typically 60 for retail
    versions. This method returns true when the player's level equals the maximum
    level allowed by the game rules, and false otherwise. It is commonly used in game
    logic to determine whether a player can progress further or to trigger special
    events when reaching maximum level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has reached the maximum level, false otherwise.
    The method does not return null or error values as it is a simple boolean check.

  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It relies on
    the player's current level value which is updated through game mechanics. The
    method does not require any special conditions or pre-requisites.
