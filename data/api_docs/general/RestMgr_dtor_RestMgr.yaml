documentation:
  brief: Destroys the RestMgr instance and performs cleanup operations
  description: The ~RestMgr destructor is called when a RestMgr object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup of any resources
    allocated by the RestMgr instance, including releasing memory and terminating
    any ongoing processes related to rest management. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this class likely manages player rest states, energy
    regeneration, and related game mechanics. The destructor should be invoked automatically
    by the C++ runtime when the object is no longer needed.

  - title: Automatic destruction of RestMgr instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    RestMgr* restManager = new RestMgr();\n   \
      \ // ... use restManager ...\n    delete restManager; // ~RestMgr() will be\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call
    this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction
    process ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures and prevents resource
    leaks.
