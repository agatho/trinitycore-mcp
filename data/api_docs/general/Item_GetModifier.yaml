documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the value of a specific item modifier from an Item object.
  description: The GetModifier method returns the value associated with a given item
    modifier type for a specific Item instance. This method is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to access item properties such as stats, bonuses,
    or other modifiers that affect gameplay mechanics. The method operates on the
    item's internal data structure and provides direct access to modifier values without
    requiring additional calculations or lookups. It is particularly useful for examining
    item attributes during item creation, modification, or when processing item effects
    in game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the uint32 value associated with the specified ItemModifier type.
    This value represents the numerical modifier applied to the item, such as stat
    values, bonus amounts, or other property modifiers depending on the modifier type.
    The return value may be zero if no modifier is present or if the modifier type
    is not applicable to the current item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      uint32 statValue = item->GetModifier(ItemModifier::ITEM_MOD_MANA);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = new Item();\nuint32 statValue = item->GetModifier(ItemModifier::ITEM_MOD_STRENGTH);\n\
      if (statValue > 0)\n{\n    // Process the modifier value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe when used with properly synchronized Item objects.
    Performance considerations include avoiding repeated calls to this method for
    large numbers of items, as it involves direct data access rather than complex
    calculations. Developers should be aware that the method returns zero for non-existent
    modifiers and that modifier types are defined by enum values in TrinityCore's
    item system.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the ItemModifier type is valid or
    present on the item. It may return zero even if no modifier exists, so developers
    must ensure proper handling of returned values to avoid incorrect assumptions
    about item properties. Also, be cautious when using this method with items that
    have not been fully initialized or modified.
