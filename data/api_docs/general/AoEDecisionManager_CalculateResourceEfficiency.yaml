documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the resource efficiency ratio between an AoE spell
    and a single-target spell for AI decision making.
  description: The CalculateResourceEfficiency method evaluates the relative efficiency
    of using an Area of Effect (AoE) spell versus a single-target spell in terms of
    resource consumption. This method is typically used by AI systems within TrinityCore
    to make strategic decisions about spell selection during combat. It considers
    factors such as mana cost, cooldown duration, and damage output to determine which
    spell type provides better value for the resources invested. The returned float
    value represents the efficiency ratio, where higher values indicate that the AoE
    spell is more resource-efficient compared to the single-target alternative.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the resource efficiency ratio of the AoE spell
    versus the single-target spell. Values greater than 1.0 indicate that the AoE
    spell is more efficient, while values less than 1.0 suggest the single-target
    spell is more efficient. A value of exactly 1.0 indicates equal efficiency between
    both spells.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "float efficiency = decisionManager.CalculateResourceEfficiency(12345, 67890);\n\
      if (efficiency > 1.0f)\n{\n    // Choose AoE spell\n    player.CastSpell(target,\
      \ 12345);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Choose single-target spell\n    player.CastSpell(target,\
      \ 67890);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other AI decision-making utilities
    within the TrinityCore framework. The efficiency calculation may be influenced
    by current combat conditions, target count, and spell-specific modifiers. Developers
    should ensure that the spell IDs passed to this method correspond to valid spells
    with defined resource costs and effects.
  warnings: This method assumes that both spell IDs are valid and have been properly
    configured in the database. Using invalid spell IDs may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect efficiency calculations. The returned value is a relative ratio and
    should be interpreted within the context of the specific game mechanics being
    evaluated.
