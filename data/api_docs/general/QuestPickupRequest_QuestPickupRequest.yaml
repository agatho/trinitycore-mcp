    uint32 gGuid, QuestGiverType gType)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a quest pickup request with specified quest ID, giver GUID, and
    type.
  description: The QuestPickupRequest method is used to create and initialize a quest
    pickup request within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the necessary
    parameters for handling quest interactions, including the quest identifier (qId),
    the GUID of the quest giver (bGuid), the GUID of the quest receiver (gGuid), and
    the type of quest giver (gType). It is typically invoked when a player interacts
    with a quest giver object to initiate or process a quest pickup event. The method
    does not return any value but prepares internal state for further processing in
    the quest system.
  parameters:
  - name: qId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being picked up. This value corresponds
      to the ID field in the quest_template table within the database.
  - name: bGuid
    description: The GUID of the quest giver object (such as an NPC or GameObject)
      that is providing the quest. This GUID uniquely identifies the specific quest
      giver instance.
  - name: gGuid
    description: The GUID of the player who is picking up the quest. This represents
      the target player's unique identifier in the game world.
  - name: gType
    description: The type of quest giver, indicating how the quest is being offered
      (e.g., NPC, GameObject). Values are typically defined by QuestGiverType enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Pickup Request Initialization
    code: 'QuestPickupRequest request(12345, 67890, 54321, QUEST_GIVER_TYPE_NPC);

      request.QuestPickupRequest(12345, 67890, 54321, QUEST_GIVER_TYPE_NPC);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest handling system and should not
    be called directly by external code. It is usually invoked automatically during
    player interaction with quest givers in the game world.
