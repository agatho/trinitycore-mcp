documentation:
  brief: Resets all pathfinding metrics to their initial state
  description: The Reset method clears and initializes all internal counters and statistics
    within the PathfindingMetrics class. This method is typically invoked to prepare
    the metrics for a new measurement period or to clear accumulated data from previous
    pathfinding operations. It ensures that subsequent measurements start with clean
    baseline values, making it useful for performance monitoring and debugging purposes.
    The reset operation affects all tracked metrics including node visits, path calculations,
    and timing data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathfindingMetrics metrics;

      metrics.Reset(); // Clear all accumulated metrics'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Reset
    code: "void UpdatePerformanceMetrics()\n{\n    // ... gather current metrics ...\n\
      \    PathfindingMetrics::Instance()->Reset(); // Prepare for next measurement\
      \ cycle\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly in performance-critical sections as
    it involves resetting all internal counters. The implementation is expected to
    be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded environments, though explicit synchronization
    may be required depending on how the metrics are accessed.
  warnings: Calling Reset() during active pathfinding operations may lead to inconsistent
    metric reporting. Ensure that no pathfinding calculations are in progress when
    invoking this method.
