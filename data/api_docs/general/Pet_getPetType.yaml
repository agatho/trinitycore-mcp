documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the type of pet associated with this Pet object.
  description: The getPetType method returns the PetType enumeration value that identifies
    the specific kind of pet this object represents. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, pets can be classified into different types such as guardian, summoned,
    or companion pets. This method allows scripts and game logic to determine how
    to handle or interact with the pet based on its type. The returned PetType value
    is determined during pet creation and remains constant throughout the pet's lifetime.
    This information is crucial for implementing pet-specific behaviors, abilities,
    and interactions within the game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PetType enumeration value indicating the category or classification of
    this pet. Possible values typically include guardian pets (like hunter's pets),
    summoned pets (like warlock's demons), and companion pets (like the player's mount
    or companion creatures).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine pet type
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    PetType petType = myPet->getPetType();\n\
      \    switch (petType)\n    {\n        case PET_TYPE_GUARDIAN:\n            //\
      \ Handle guardian pet logic\n            break;\n        case PET_TYPE_SUMMONED:\n\
      \            // Handle summoned pet logic\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Handle other pet types\n            break;\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method performs a simple lookup operation and has minimal performance
    impact. The PetType enumeration is defined in the core TrinityCore codebase, and
    its values correspond directly to the internal pet classification system used
    by the game server.
