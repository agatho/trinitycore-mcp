documentation:
  brief: Initializes the baseline rotation manager for priest class abilities and
    spell sequences.
  description: The InitializePriestBaseline method sets up the foundational spell
    rotation logic specific to the priest class within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method configures default spell priorities, cooldown tracking, and combat
    behavior patterns that define how a priest character should prioritize and cast
    spells during combat. It establishes the core rotation structure used by the AI
    system for decision-making in various encounter scenarios. The initialization
    process typically occurs once during the creation or loading of a priest AI instance,
    ensuring all necessary data structures are properly populated before any combat
    decisions are made.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializePriestBaseline();

      // The rotation manager is now ready to handle priest spell rotations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per instance during initialization.
    It assumes that the underlying AI system and spell data structures are already
    properly set up. The method does not perform any runtime validation of spell availability
    or player state.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same instance may lead to undefined
    behavior or memory leaks. Ensure all prerequisite systems (like spell database
    loading) are completed before invoking this method.
