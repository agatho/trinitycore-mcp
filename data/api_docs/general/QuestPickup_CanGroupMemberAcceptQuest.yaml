  class: QuestPickup
  method: CanGroupMemberAcceptQuest
  signature: bool QuestPickup::CanGroupMemberAcceptQuest(Player * member, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a group member can accept a specified quest.
  description: The CanGroupMemberAcceptQuest method evaluates if a given player member
    of a group is eligible to accept a specific quest. It checks various conditions
    such as quest availability, level requirements, previous quest completion status,
    and whether the player is already on the quest. This method is typically used
    during group quest sharing or when a player attempts to accept a quest that another
    group member has started. The evaluation considers both individual player state
    and group-specific restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the group member being
      evaluated for quest acceptance.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be checked for acceptance eligibility
      by the group member.
  returns: Returns true if the group member can accept the specified quest, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether all prerequisites and conditions are met for
    the player to take on the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a group member can accept a quest
    code: "if (questPickup->CanGroupMemberAcceptQuest(playerMember, 12345)) {\n  \
      \  // Player can accept the quest\n    playerMember->AddQuest(12345);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Player cannot accept the quest\n    playerMember->SendNotification(\"\
      You are not eligible to accept this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in group quest sharing logic
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group) {\n    for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator\
      \ itr = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n         itr != group->GetMemberSlots().end();\
      \ ++itr)\n    {\n        Player* member = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n\
      \        if (member && !member->HasQuest(12345) && questPickup->CanGroupMemberAcceptQuest(member,\
      \ 12345))\n        {\n            // Share quest with eligible group members\n\
      \            member->AddQuest(12345);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs multiple checks including level requirements, quest
    prerequisites, and player state. It's commonly used in group quest sharing systems
    where players need to be validated before receiving quests. The method does not
    modify the player's quest state directly but only evaluates eligibility.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Also, be aware that this method may perform database queries internally
    for checking quest states and prerequisites, so it should not be called excessively
    in performance-critical sections of code.
