  class: SurvivalHunterRefactored
  method: OnInterruptRequired
  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::OnInterruptRequired(int * target, uint32
    param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the required interrupt event for a survival hunter, processing target
    and parameter data.
  description: The OnInterruptRequired method is a callback function within the SurvivalHunterRefactored
    AI class that manages interrupt-related events for a survival hunter class. This
    method processes an integer pointer to a target entity and a uint32 parameter,
    likely used to determine interrupt behavior or effects based on the provided data.
    The method is typically invoked when an interrupt condition occurs during combat,
    such as when a hunter's ability is interrupted by incoming damage or external
    effects. It serves as part of the AI's response system to handle interruptions
    in spellcasting or ability usage.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the target entity that triggered
      the interrupt event. This may reference a unit, mob, or player object depending
      on context.
  - name: param1
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer parameter that provides additional data
      about the interrupt condition. This could represent spell ID, damage type, or
      other interrupt-related metadata.
  returns: null

    code: "void SurvivalHunterRefactored::OnInterruptRequired(int* target, uint32\
      \ param1) {\n    if (target && *target != 0) {\n        // Process the interrupt\
      \ based on target and parameter\n        HandleInterrupt(*target, param1);\n\
      \    }\n}"

    code: "void SurvivalHunterRefactored::OnInterruptRequired(int* target, uint32\
      \ param1) {\n    if (!target || *target <= 0) return;\n    \n    // Log the\
      \ interrupt event\n    sLog->outString(\"Survival Hunter interrupted on target\
      \ %d with param %u\", *target, param1);\n    \n    // Apply interrupt-specific\
      \ logic\n    switch (param1) {\n        case 1:\n            // Handle spell\
      \ interruption\n            break;\n        case 2:\n            // Handle damage-based\
      \ interruption\n            break;\n        default:\n            // Default\
      \ behavior\n            break;\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the AI system and should be called only during combat
    or interrupt-related events. The target parameter must be validated before dereferencing
    to prevent null pointer exceptions. Implementation may vary depending on specific
    hunter specialization or class overrides.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before accessing its value to
    avoid undefined behavior. This method does not return any value, so it should
    not be used for conditional logic based on results.
