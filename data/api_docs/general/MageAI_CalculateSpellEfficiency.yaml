  class: MageAI
  method: CalculateSpellEfficiency
  signature: float MageAI::CalculateSpellEfficiency(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the efficiency rating of a specified spell for the
    Mage AI.
  description: The CalculateSpellEfficiency method evaluates how effectively a given
    spell is used by the Mage AI, taking into account factors such as spell damage
    output, mana cost, cast time, and situational relevance. This value is typically
    used to determine spell prioritization during combat. The method does not require
    any parameters beyond the spell ID, which uniquely identifies the spell to be
    evaluated. It returns a float value representing the calculated efficiency, where
    higher values indicate more effective spells in the current context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point number representing the calculated efficiency of the spell.
    Higher values indicate better efficiency, with typical ranges between 0.0 (least
    efficient) and 1.0 (most efficient). The exact scale may vary based on internal
    AI logic and game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float efficiency = mageAI->CalculateSpellEfficiency(133); // Frostbolt\
      \ spell ID\nif (efficiency > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Prioritize using this spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with internal AI decision-making systems to
    dynamically adjust spell selection based on current game state, such as target
    health, available mana, and combat situation. It may cache results or use heuristic
    algorithms for performance.
