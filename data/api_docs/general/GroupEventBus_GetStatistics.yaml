  class: GroupEventBus
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & GroupEventBus::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the statistical data structure containing event handling metrics
    for the group event bus.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to a Statistics
    object that holds various metrics and counters related to event processing within
    the GroupEventBus. This includes information such as total events processed, successful
    operations, failed attempts, and other performance-related data. The returned
    statistics are updated in real-time as events are handled by the bus, providing
    insights into the efficiency and behavior of group-based event handling mechanisms
    in TrinityCore. This method is typically used for monitoring, debugging, or performance
    analysis purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a Statistics object containing cumulative metrics
    about event processing within the GroupEventBus. The structure includes counters
    for events processed, successes, failures, and other relevant statistical data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display group event bus statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = groupEventBus.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total Events: " << stats.totalEvents << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Successful: " << stats.successCount << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Failed: " << stats.failureCount << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is read-only and should not be modified directly.
    The statistics are updated atomically during event processing to ensure thread
    safety. This method does not perform any expensive operations and returns immediately
    with a cached reference to the current statistics.
  warnings: Accessing the returned reference after the GroupEventBus instance has
    been destroyed results in undefined behavior. The statistics may be modified by
    concurrent threads during active event processing, so for critical applications,
    consider copying the data before use.
