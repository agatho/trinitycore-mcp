  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: OptimizeForPerformance
  signature: void InterruptAwareness::OptimizeForPerformance()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the interrupt awareness system for performance by adjusting internal
    thresholds and processing logic.
  description: The OptimizeForPerformance method configures the InterruptAwareness
    class to prioritize efficiency over granularity in interrupt detection and handling.
    This method typically adjusts internal parameters such as polling intervals, sensitivity
    thresholds, or decision-making algorithms to reduce CPU overhead while maintaining
    acceptable responsiveness. It is commonly used during high-load scenarios or when
    performance is a critical concern, such as in large-scale battlegrounds or when
    processing numerous simultaneous interrupts. The optimization may involve disabling
    certain detailed checks or reducing the frequency of state evaluations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      awareness.OptimizeForPerformance();

      // Performance-optimized interrupt handling enabled'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage During High Load Conditions
    code: "if (IsHighLoadScenario()) {\n    interruptAwareness.OptimizeForPerformance();\n\
      \    // Reduce CPU usage during intense combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state and should be called before entering
    performance-critical sections. It may alter the behavior of other methods in the
    class, particularly those related to interrupt detection accuracy.
  warnings: Calling this method may reduce the precision or responsiveness of interrupt
    handling. Ensure that performance optimization is appropriate for the current
    game context and does not compromise gameplay integrity.
