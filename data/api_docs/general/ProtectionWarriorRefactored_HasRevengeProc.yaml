documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Protection Warrior has an active Revenge proc.
  description: The HasRevengeProc method determines whether the Protection Warrior
    class currently has an active Revenge spell proc. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, this method typically checks internal state flags or aura application
    status to verify if the player is benefiting from the Revenge ability's damage
    amplification effect. This is commonly used in combat logic and spell processing
    to determine how incoming attacks should be handled or modified based on the warrior's
    current state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Protection Warrior has an active Revenge proc, false
    otherwise. The proc status is determined by checking for specific aura application
    states or internal cooldown flags associated with the Revenge ability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat logic
    code: "if (player->GetClass() == CLASS_WARRIOR && player->GetSubClass() == WARRIOR_SUBCLASS_PROTECTION)\
      \ {\n    ProtectionWarriorRefactored* warrior = static_cast<ProtectionWarriorRefactored*>(player);\n\
      \    if (warrior->HasRevengeProc()) {\n        // Apply additional damage or\
      \ effects\n        damage *= 1.3f; // 30% bonus from Revenge proc\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state tracking for the Revenge aura
    and may be called frequently during combat processing. It's important to note
    that the actual proc activation is handled by the core game mechanics, not this
    specific check.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a substitute for checking if the player actually
    has the Revenge spell available in their spellbook or if they are eligible to
    cast it. This only checks for an active proc state, not general availability.
