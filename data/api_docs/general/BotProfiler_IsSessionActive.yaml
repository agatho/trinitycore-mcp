  signature: bool BotProfiler::IsSessionActive(uint64_t sessionId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a bot profiling session with the specified ID is currently
    active.
  description: The IsSessionActive method determines if a bot profiling session identified
    by the given session ID is currently running or has been terminated. This functionality
    is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to manage and monitor bot behavior
    analysis sessions, ensuring that operations are only performed on active sessions.
    The method performs a lookup in an internal data structure that tracks all active
    profiling sessions, returning true if the session exists and is still active,
    false otherwise. It's commonly called before performing actions that require an
    active session context to prevent errors or undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a bot profiling session with the specified ID is currently
    active; returns false if no such session exists or if it has already been terminated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check session status
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = 123456789ULL;\nif (botProfiler.IsSessionActive(sessionId))\
      \ {\n    // Perform operations on active session\n    std::cout << \"Session\
      \ is active\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle inactive session\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Session is not active\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses a thread-safe internal data structure to track session
    states. It's recommended to avoid calling this method in performance-critical
    sections without caching results, as repeated lookups may impact performance during
    high-frequency operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the session ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual profiling session; passing invalid IDs may result in false negatives
    or undefined behavior depending on implementation details.
