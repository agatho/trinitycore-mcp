  signature: void LootCoordination::HandleLootGrievances(Group * group, uint32 complainingPlayer,
    const std::string & grievance)
documentation:
  brief: Processes player grievances related to loot distribution within a group.
  description: The HandleLootGrievances method is responsible for managing and resolving
    player complaints or grievances regarding loot distribution decisions made during
    group looting. This method typically receives a group context, the player who
    filed the grievance, and a description of the grievance. It handles the internal
    logic to address these complaints, potentially re-evaluating loot assignments
    or triggering alternative distribution mechanisms as part of the TrinityCore's
    loot coordination system.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group where the grievance
      originated. Must be a valid group instance with active members.
  - name: complainingPlayer
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is filing the grievance.
      Should correspond to a valid online player in the group.
  - name: grievance
    description: A string describing the specific grievance or complaint about loot
      distribution. Can include details such as unfair allocation or incorrect item
      assignment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic grievance handling in a group
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      std::string grievance = "Item was not fairly distributed";

      LootCoordination::HandleLootGrievances(myGroup, playerId, grievance);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot coordination system and likely interacts
    with internal loot tracking structures. It may trigger re-evaluation of loot assignments
    or notify other group members depending on server configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and that the complaining player
    GUID corresponds to an active member in the group. Improper use could lead to
    invalid memory access or incorrect loot handling.
