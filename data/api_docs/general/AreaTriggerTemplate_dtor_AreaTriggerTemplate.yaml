documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AreaTriggerTemplate instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AreaTriggerTemplate class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an
    AreaTriggerTemplate instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the
    context of TrinityCore, this would typically be used in conjunction with area
    trigger templates that define the properties and behavior of area triggers within
    the game world. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return
    operations as it is a destructor.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of AreaTriggerTemplate
    code: 'AreaTriggerTemplate* triggerTemplate = new AreaTriggerTemplate();

      // ... use the template ...

      delete triggerTemplate; // This calls the destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is deleted. Developers should not manually call destructors unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. In TrinityCore's context, area trigger templates
    are typically managed by the server's internal systems and manual destruction
    is rare.
