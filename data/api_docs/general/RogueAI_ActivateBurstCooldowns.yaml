  class: RogueAI
  method: ActivateBurstCooldowns
  signature: void RogueAI::ActivateBurstCooldowns(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Activates burst cooldowns for the rogue AI, enabling high-damage abilities
    during combat.
  description: The ActivateBurstCooldowns method is responsible for managing and activating
    burst-style cooldown abilities within the RogueAI class. This typically involves
    triggering abilities that deal significant damage over a short period, such as
    Slice and Dice, Eviscerate, or other high-damage combo point generators. The method
    evaluates the current combat state, available energy or resources, and target
    conditions to determine when and which burst abilities should be activated. It
    is designed to maximize damage output during key moments in combat while respecting
    cooldown constraints and resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that the rogue AI will apply burst cooldowns
      against. This parameter determines which enemy receives the burst abilities
      and influences decision-making logic for ability selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void RogueAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n   \
      \ {\n        Unit* target = me->GetVictim();\n        if (target && target->IsAlive())\n\
      \        {\n            ActivateBurstCooldowns(&target);\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and relies on the
    rogue's current energy levels, combo points, and target status. It assumes that
    the AI has already determined it is in a suitable combat situation to use burst
    abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. The method does not perform null checks on the target
    parameter internally.
