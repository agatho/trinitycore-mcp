  class: ControlZoneHandler
  method: HandleNeutralEventHorde
  signature: void ControlZoneHandler::HandleNeutralEventHorde(GameObject * controlZone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a Horde player interacts with a neutral control zone
    object.
  description: The HandleNeutralEventHorde method processes interactions between Horde
    players and neutral control zones within the World of Warcraft game environment.
    This function is typically invoked when a Horde character enters or interacts
    with a control zone that is currently neutral (not controlled by either faction).
    The method likely updates the zone's faction control status, triggers relevant
    quest events, and may award rewards or modify player state. It serves as part
    of the broader territorial control system in TrinityCore, managing how factions
    can capture and maintain control over strategic locations in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: controlZone
    description: Pointer to the GameObject representing the neutral control zone being
      interacted with. This object must be a valid control zone type with appropriate
      faction handling logic implemented.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game event handler
    code: "void GameEvent::OnPlayerEnterControlZone(Player* player, GameObject* controlZone)\n\
      {\n    if (player->GetTeam() == HORDE)\n        sControlZoneHandler->HandleNeutralEventHorde(controlZone);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger control zone management system that
    tracks faction dominance over territories. It assumes the GameObject parameter
    is properly initialized and represents a valid neutral control zone. The implementation
    may involve checking player faction, validating interaction conditions, and updating
    game state accordingly.
  warnings: Ensure that the controlZone parameter is not null before calling this
    method to prevent runtime errors. This function should only be called when a Horde
    player interacts with a neutral zone; calling it for other factions or states
    may cause unexpected behavior in the control zone system.
