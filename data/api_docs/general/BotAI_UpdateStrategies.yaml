  class: BotAI
  method: UpdateStrategies
  signature: void BotAI::UpdateStrategies(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the AI strategies for a bot based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateStrategies method is responsible for managing and updating
    the artificial intelligence behaviors of a bot within the TrinityCore framework.
    It processes the bot's current state, evaluates relevant game conditions, and
    adjusts the active AI strategies accordingly. This method is typically called
    during the bot's update cycle to ensure that its behavior remains adaptive and
    responsive to changing circumstances in the game world. The method uses the provided
    time delta (diff) parameter to determine how much time has passed since the last
    update, which influences strategy decisions and timing-based actions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-based AI decisions and cooldowns for bot behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateStrategies Call
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTimeDiff(m_lastUpdate,\
      \ getMSTime());\n    UpdateStrategies(diff);\n    m_lastUpdate = getMSTime();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the bot's main update loop.
    It should be called regularly to maintain responsive AI behavior. The diff parameter
    is crucial for accurate timing of strategy changes and cooldowns.
