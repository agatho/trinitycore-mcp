  class: Unit
  method: AddGameObject
  signature: void Unit::AddGameObject(GameObject * gameObj)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a GameObject to the unit's object list, making it accessible to the
    unit.
  description: The AddGameObject method adds a GameObject instance to the Unit's internal
    list of game objects, allowing the unit to interact with and reference the GameObject.
    This method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework where units (such as players or creatures) can have GameObjects associated
    with them through various gameplay mechanics like quest objectives or area triggers.
    The method ensures that the GameObject is properly linked to the unit's object
    list, enabling access to its properties and functionality during gameplay interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: gameObj
    description: A pointer to a GameObject instance that will be added to the unit's
      object list. This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid GameObject
      object within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit();

      GameObject* gameObj = new GameObject();

      player->AddGameObject(gameObj);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with proper error checking
    code: "Unit* player = new Unit();\nGameObject* gameObj = new GameObject();\nif\
      \ (gameObj != nullptr) {\n    player->AddGameObject(gameObj);\n}\nelse {\n \
      \   // Handle null pointer case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit's internal object management system. It should
    be used carefully as it affects the unit's object list and can influence game
    mechanics related to GameObject interactions. The method may involve memory management
    considerations, especially when dealing with GameObjects that are created or destroyed
    during gameplay.
  warnings: The method assumes that the GameObject pointer is valid and properly initialized.
    Using a null pointer or an invalid GameObject instance can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Care should be taken to ensure that GameObjects are properly managed
    before adding them to the unit's list.
