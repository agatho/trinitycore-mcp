  class: MovementGenerator
  method: Pause
  signature: void MovementGenerator::Pause(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Pauses the movement generator's current movement behavior for a specified
    duration.
  description: The Pause method temporarily halts the execution of a movement generator,
    preventing it from updating or processing movement-related logic until resumed.
    This is commonly used in AI systems to temporarily disable movement during combat,
    casting spells, or other game events that require the unit to remain stationary.
    The pause duration is typically controlled by the param0 parameter which specifies
    how long (in milliseconds) the movement should be suspended. During the paused
    state, the movement generator will not process pathfinding, waypoint following,
    or any other movement-related updates.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the movement generator should
      be paused. This value determines how long the movement behavior is suspended
      before automatically resuming.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pause Usage
    code: 'MovementGenerator* mg = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();

      mg->Pause(5000); // Pause for 5 seconds

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Pause During Combat
    code: "if (unit->IsInCombat()) {\n    MovementGenerator* mg = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();\n\
      \    mg->Pause(3000); // Pause movement for 3 seconds during combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Pause method is typically implemented using a timer-based system that
    tracks the elapsed time since pausing. It's important to note that this pause
    does not affect other movement generators in the motion master's stack, only the
    currently active one. The method should be called on the main thread as movement
    updates are generally handled synchronously.
  warnings: Calling Pause with a very large value may cause unexpected behavior or
    performance issues. It's recommended to use reasonable pause durations and ensure
    that all pauses are properly resumed to avoid leaving units in an indefinitely
    paused state. Also, be cautious when pausing movement generators during critical
    game events like spell casting or combat.
