  class: Weather
  method: Weather
  signature: void Weather::Weather(uint32 zoneId, const WeatherData * weatherChances)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes weather conditions for a specified zone with given weather data.
  description: The Weather method is responsible for setting up and initializing weather
    conditions for a specific game zone using provided weather data. This method is
    typically called during server initialization or when zone-specific weather needs
    to be configured. It takes a zone identifier and a pointer to weather data structure
    that defines the weather patterns, probabilities, and intensity levels for that
    particular zone. The method does not return any value but modifies internal weather
    state for the specified zone.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: Unique identifier for the game zone where weather conditions will
      be applied. This corresponds to the ZoneID field in the database and determines
      which area of the world will have its weather configured.
  - name: weatherChances
    description: Pointer to a WeatherData structure containing weather probability
      and intensity information for the specified zone. This structure typically includes
      data about rain, snow, storm, and clear weather probabilities along with their
      respective intensities and durations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Weather for Eastern Kingdoms
    code: 'WeatherData easternKingdomsWeather;

      // Configure weather data for Eastern Kingdoms

      // ...

      Weather->Weather(1, &easternKingdomsWeather); // Zone ID 1 corresponds to Eastern
      Kingdoms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Weather with Custom Parameters
    code: 'WeatherData customWeather;

      customWeather.rainChance = 30;

      customWeather.snowChance = 15;

      customWeather.stormChance = 5;

      customWeather.clearChance = 50;

      customWeather.intensity = 0.7f;

      Weather->Weather(42, &customWeather); // Zone ID 42 for a custom zone'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when loading zone
    data from the database. The WeatherData structure must be properly initialized
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. This method modifies global
    weather state and affects all players within the specified zone.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for weatherChances parameter will likely cause
    a crash or undefined behavior. Zone IDs must correspond to valid zones in the
    database, otherwise weather configuration may not be applied correctly. Ensure
    that WeatherData values are within acceptable ranges (e.g., probabilities sum
    to 100%).
