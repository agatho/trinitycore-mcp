api:
  class: SpellAction
  method: GetSpellId
  signature: uint32 SpellAction::GetSpellId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell identifier associated with the SpellAction instance.
  description: The GetSpellId method returns the unique identifier (ID) of the spell
    that this SpellAction object represents. This ID corresponds to an entry in the
    spell database and is used internally by the TrinityCore server to identify and
    process specific spell effects, triggers, and behaviors. The returned value is
    typically used for spell lookups, validation, or integration with other systems
    that require knowledge of a spell's identity. This method does not perform any
    side effects or modifications to the object state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the spell ID associated with this SpellAction
    instance. This ID maps directly to an entry in the dbc files or database tables
    related to spells.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SpellAction* action = ...;\nuint32 spellId = action->GetSpellId();\nif\
      \ (spellId != 0)\n{\n    // Process the spell ID\n    sLog->outString(\"Spell\
      \ ID: %u\", spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Spell ID for Database Lookup
    code: "SpellAction* action = ...;\nuint32 spellId = action->GetSpellId();\nif\
      \ (spellId > 0)\n{\n    SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(spellId);\n\
      \    if (spellInfo)\n    {\n        // Use spell info for further processing\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Spell Name: %s\", spellInfo->SpellName[0]);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and should be called frequently without performance
    concerns. It assumes that the SpellAction object has been properly initialized
    with a valid spell ID. The returned value will be zero if no spell is associated
    with the action, which may indicate an invalid or uninitialized state.
  warnings: Ensure that the SpellAction instance is valid before calling this method
    to avoid accessing potentially undefined behavior. If the method returns zero,
    it may not necessarily mean an error but could imply that no spell is currently
    bound to the action.
