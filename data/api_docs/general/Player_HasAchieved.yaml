documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has earned a specific achievement.
  description: This method determines whether a player has achieved a particular achievement
    by checking the player's achievement progress. It returns true if the achievement
    has been earned and false otherwise. The method is commonly used in game logic
    to verify player accomplishments, such as completing quests or reaching milestones.
    This functionality is essential for determining player progression and unlocking
    rewards based on achievement completion status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has earned the specified achievement, false
    otherwise. The return value indicates whether the achievement is marked as completed
    in the player's achievement system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Achievement Check
    code: "if (player->HasAchieved(1234)) {\n    // Player has earned achievement\
      \ 1234\n}\nelse {\n    // Player hasn't earned achievement 1234\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks against the player's achievement database and
    may involve database queries or cached values depending on implementation. Performance
    considerations include potential database load when checking achievements for
    players with many completed achievements.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks if an achievement has been earned,
    not necessarily whether it is visible or available to the player. Some achievements
    might be hidden or require specific conditions to become visible.
