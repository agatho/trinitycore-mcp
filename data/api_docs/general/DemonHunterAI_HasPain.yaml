  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: HasPain
  signature: bool DemonHunterAI::HasPain(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Demon Hunter has sufficient pain resource to perform an action.
  description: The HasPain method determines whether the Demon Hunter AI character
    possesses enough pain resource to execute a specific ability or spell. Pain is
    a core resource in the Demon Hunter class mechanics, used for various abilities
    such as Eye Beam, Fel Rush, and other class-specific spells. This method evaluates
    the current pain amount against a required threshold, typically based on the context
    of the action being considered. The check is essential for proper AI decision-making
    and ability usage within the Demon Hunter's combat behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The minimum pain amount required to perform the intended action.
      This value represents the pain cost of the ability or spell being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the Demon Hunter currently has at least the specified amount
    of pain available; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pain Check for Ability Usage
    code: "if (ai->HasPain(40)) {\n    // Use Eye Beam ability\n    ai->DoAction(ACTION_USE_EYE_BEAM);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Pain-Based AI Decision
    code: "if (ai->HasPain(25) && !ai->IsCasting()) {\n    // Cast Fel Rush if enough\
      \ pain and not casting\n    ai->DoAction(ACTION_CAST_FEL_RUSH);\n} else if (ai->HasPain(10))\
      \ {\n    // Use a cheaper ability like Demon Spikes\n    ai->DoAction(ACTION_CAST_DEMON_SPIKES);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the Demon Hunter's pain resource management
    system. It should be called before attempting to use any pain-consuming abilities
    to prevent invalid actions. The method does not modify the pain amount; it only
    performs a read-only check.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'amount' parameter accurately reflects the actual pain
    cost of the ability being checked. Using incorrect values may lead to AI behavior
    that appears inconsistent with game mechanics or causes abilities to be used when
    they shouldn't be.
