  class: QuestHubDatabase
  method: LoadQuestGiversFromDB
  signature: uint32 QuestHubDatabase::LoadQuestGiversFromDB()
documentation:
  brief: Loads quest givers from the database into memory for use in the game world.
  description: The LoadQuestGiversFromDB method retrieves all quest giver entries
    from the database and populates internal data structures used by the QuestHub
    system. This method is typically called during server startup or when reloading
    quest data to ensure that all NPCs and objects capable of offering quests are
    properly registered in memory. It iterates through the database records, processes
    each quest giver entry, and builds lookup tables for fast retrieval during quest
    interaction events. The method ensures that quest givers are correctly linked
    to their associated quests and that all relevant quest data is available for player
    interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the total number of quest givers successfully loaded from the database.
    A return value of zero indicates either no quest givers exist in the database
    or an error occurred during the loading process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: 'uint32 loadedCount = sQuestHubDatabase->LoadQuestGiversFromDB();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, "Loaded %u quest givers from database", loadedCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    explicitly reloading quest data. Repeated calls may result in duplicate entries
    or memory leaks if not properly handled. The method assumes that the database
    connection is already established and functional.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within active game loops or high-frequency
    update functions as it may block the main thread and impact performance. Ensure
    proper error handling since failed loads can leave quest givers unregistered in
    the system.
