api:
  class: LootCoordination
  method: FacilitateGroupLootDiscussion
  signature: void LootCoordination::FacilitateGroupLootDiscussion(Group * group, const
    LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates group loot discussion for a specified item within a group.
  description: The FacilitateGroupLootDiscussion method is responsible for starting
    the process of group loot coordination when an item is ready to be distributed
    among group members. It ensures that all group members are notified and can participate
    in the loot distribution decision-making process, typically used during dungeon
    or raid encounters where items are looted from defeated enemies. This method handles
    the synchronization of loot state across the group and may trigger UI updates
    or communication mechanisms to allow players to vote or decide on loot assignment.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that will participate
      in the loot discussion. Must be a valid group instance with at least one member.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      item being discussed for group loot distribution. The item must have valid loot
      data and be associated with a valid loot source.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a loot handler
    code: "void HandleLootDrop(Player* player, Creature* creature) {\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (!group) return;\n    \n    LootItem item;\n\
      \    // Assume item is populated with valid loot data\n    LootCoordination::FacilitateGroupLootDiscussion(group,\
      \ item);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal loot coordination systems and
    may involve sending network packets to all group members. It's expected to be
    called after a loot item has been generated but before it is assigned to a specific
    player.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and that the LootItem contains
    proper data before calling this method. Calling with invalid parameters may lead
    to undefined behavior or client-side errors.
