  signature: bool ThreatCoordinator::IsBotAtThreatCap(int botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a bot is at its threat cap limit for threat generation.
  description: The IsBotAtThreatCap method determines whether a specific bot character
    has reached the maximum threat value allowed for that bot. This functionality
    is used in TrinityCore's AI system to manage combat behavior and ensure bots do
    not exceed predefined threat thresholds, which could disrupt game balance or cause
    unexpected combat mechanics. The method evaluates the current threat state of
    the specified bot against its configured cap limit.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character to check. This
      should be a valid GameObjectGuid representing a bot in the world.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot has reached its threat cap limit, false
    otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the bot's current threat level
    is at or above the maximum allowed threshold.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a bot is at threat cap
    code: "if (threatCoordinator->IsBotAtThreatCap(botGuid)) {\n    // Bot has reached\
      \ threat cap, handle accordingly\n    HandleBotThreatCapReached(botGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a combat AI decision making loop
    code: "void CombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (IsBotAtThreatCap(GetCurrentBotGuid()))\
      \ {\n        // Switch to different combat behavior\n        SetCombatBehavior(COMBAT_BEHAVIOR_FLEE);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Continue normal combat actions\n        PerformNormalCombatActions();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within AI update loops to make real-time decisions
    about bot behavior. The threat cap value for each bot may be configurable through
    game settings or AI parameters. The method assumes that the bot GUID refers to
    a valid bot object in the current world state.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an actual bot character,
    as invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method should
    not be called on non-bot GameObjects without proper validation.
