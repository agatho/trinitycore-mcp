documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SocialMgr instance and cleans up associated social list data.
  description: The destructor for the SocialMgr class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up all memory and resources associated with the social management system.
    This includes releasing any allocated memory for player friend lists, ignore lists,
    and other social data structures. The destructor ensures that no memory leaks
    occur when a SocialMgr instance is destroyed, which typically happens during server
    shutdown or when a player disconnects from the game world. It performs necessary
    cleanup operations to maintain the integrity of the social subsystem.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SocialMgr instance
    code: "void CleanupSocialManager()\n{\n    // SocialMgr instance goes out of scope\n\
      \    // Destructor automatically called\n    SocialMgr* socialMgr = new SocialMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use social manager ...\n    delete socialMgr; // Calls ~SocialMgr()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a SocialMgr object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this destructor
    should not be called manually unless the object was dynamically allocated, as
    it's part of the standard C++ object lifecycle management.
