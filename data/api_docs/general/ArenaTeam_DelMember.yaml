  class: ArenaTeam
  method: DelMember
  signature: void ArenaTeam::DelMember(int guid, bool cleanDb)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a member from an arena team, optionally cleaning the database record.
  description: The DelMember method removes a specified player member from the arena
    team. It takes a GUID identifying the player to be removed and a boolean flag
    indicating whether to clean up the database entry for that member. When cleanDb
    is true, the method will remove the member's record from the database; otherwise,
    it only removes the member from the in-memory team structure. This operation affects
    the team's composition and may impact the team's rating and matchmaking eligibility
    if the removed member was a significant contributor.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from the
      arena team. Must correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  - name: cleanDb
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to remove the member's database record.
      If true, removes all associated data for this member from the database; if false,
      only removes the member from the team structure in memory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a player from an arena team and clean database
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    team->DelMember(54321, true); // Remove player with GUID 54321 and clean\
      \ DB\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove a player from an arena team without cleaning database
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    team->DelMember(54321, false); // Remove player with GUID 54321 but keep\
      \ DB record\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ArenaTeam object is properly initialized and
    that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid member of the team. The method does
    not validate whether the team has enough members to remain functional after removal,
    which could lead to an invalid team state if critical members are removed.
  warnings: Removing a player from an arena team may affect the team's performance
    in competitive play. Ensure that this action is intended and that the team remains
    viable for continued participation. Also, be cautious when setting cleanDb=true
    as it permanently removes database records.
