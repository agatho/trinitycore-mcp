  class: BattlePetManager
  method: IsAbilityStrongAgainst
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::IsAbilityStrongAgainst(PetFamily abilityFamily,
    PetFamily opponentFamily) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a battle pet ability is strong against a specific opponent
    family.
  description: The IsAbilityStrongAgainst method evaluates whether a given pet ability
    (represented by its family type) has a strategic advantage over a specified opponent
    pet family. This functionality is used in the context of World of Warcraft's Battle
    Pet system to determine damage multipliers and combat effectiveness. The method
    performs a lookup against predefined battle pet family matchups, which are based
    on game mechanics such as elemental or creature-type advantages. It returns true
    if the ability is considered strong (effective) against the opponent family, and
    false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: abilityFamily
    description: The PetFamily enum value representing the type of ability being evaluated
      for effectiveness.
  - name: opponentFamily
    description: The PetFamily enum value representing the opponent's pet family against
      which the ability is tested.
  returns: Returns true if the specified ability family has a strategic advantage
    over the opponent family, indicating that attacks using this ability will be more
    effective. Returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Fire Ability is Strong Against Beast
    code: "if (battlePetManager.IsAbilityStrongAgainst(PetFamily::FIRE, PetFamily::BEAST))\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where fire ability is strong against beast pets\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine Effectiveness in Battle Logic
    code: "bool isEffective = battlePetManager.IsAbilityStrongAgainst(PetFamily::WATER,\
      \ PetFamily::FIRE);\nif (isEffective) {\n    // Apply increased damage multiplier\
      \ for water ability vs fire opponent\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal battle pet family matchup tables defined in
    the TrinityCore codebase. It is designed to be efficient and used during combat
    calculations or AI decision-making processes. The implementation assumes valid
    PetFamily enum values are passed; invalid inputs may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters represent valid PetFamily enum values before
    calling this method, as passing invalid enums could result in incorrect logic
    or crashes. This method should not be used outside of battle pet combat contexts
    where family matchups are relevant.
