  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: LoadFromDB
  signature: bool BlackMarketEntry::LoadFromDB(int * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads black market entry data from the database into the object's member
    variables.
  description: The LoadFromDB method retrieves black market item data from the database
    and populates the BlackMarketEntry object with the retrieved values. This method
    is typically called during server initialization or when a player interacts with
    the black market interface to fetch current auction data. It processes the database
    result set and assigns values to internal member variables such as item ID, bid
    amount, and auction duration. The method returns true upon successful loading
    of data, or false if the operation fails due to missing or invalid data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the black market entry data was successfully loaded from
    the database; otherwise, returns false if the load operation failed or no valid
    data was found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Initialization
    code: "BlackMarketEntry entry;\nif (entry.LoadFromDB(&fields))\n{\n    // Successfully\
      \ loaded black market entry\n    sLog->outString(\"Loaded black market entry\
      \ with ID: %u\", entry.GetId());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to load entry\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to load black market entry\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database connection is already established and
    that the fields parameter points to a valid result set from a black market query.
    It's typically used internally by the black market system and should not be called
    directly by other systems unless necessary.
