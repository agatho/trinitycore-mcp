  signature: void TradeSystem::AnalyzeTradePatterns(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes trading behavior and patterns of a player to identify trends and
    potential exploits.
  description: The AnalyzeTradePatterns method examines a player's trading history
    and current trading activities within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates
    various aspects such as transaction frequency, item types traded, price discrepancies,
    and trade timing to detect unusual or potentially exploitative behavior. This
    function is typically used by the game's anti-cheat and fraud detection systems
    to maintain fair play. The method does not modify any player data directly but
    may trigger alerts or logging for suspicious activities. It requires a valid Player
    object reference and operates on the current session state of that player.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerTrade(Player* player)\n{\n    TradeSystem::AnalyzeTradePatterns(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Anti-Cheat System
    code: "void CheckForTradingAbuse(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player)\n    {\n\
      \        TradeSystem::AnalyzeTradePatterns(player);\n        // Additional logic\
      \ for flagged players\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during trade events or periodically as part
    of a broader fraud detection system. It may involve database queries to retrieve
    trading history and could have performance implications if used excessively. The
    analysis might be asynchronous or queued depending on the implementation.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper player validation can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before invoking
    this function. This method should not be used for real-time trade validation as
    it's designed for post-transaction analysis rather than live monitoring.
