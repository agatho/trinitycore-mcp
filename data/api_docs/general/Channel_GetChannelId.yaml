  method: GetChannelId
  signature: uint32 Channel::GetChannelId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the channel.
  description: The GetChannelId method retrieves the unique numerical identifier assigned
    to a specific chat channel within the TrinityCore framework. This identifier is
    used internally by the game server to distinguish between different channels,
    such as general, trade, or guild channels. The returned value represents the channel's
    persistent ID that remains constant throughout the channel's lifetime. This method
    is typically called when managing channel membership, sending messages to specific
    channels, or performing administrative operations on channels.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the channel. This
    ID is assigned by the server upon channel creation and remains unchanged for the
    channel's duration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Channel ID
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChatHandler->GetChannelByName("General");

      uint32 channelId = channel->GetChannelId();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_CHAT, "Channel ID: %u", channelId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Channel ID for Message Routing
    code: "Channel* channel = sObjectMgr->GetChannel(12345);\nif (channel)\n{\n  \
      \  uint32 id = channel->GetChannelId();\n    // Use id to route messages or\
      \ perform channel-specific operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The channel ID is generated and managed by the TrinityCore server. It's important
    to note that channel IDs are not guaranteed to be sequential or predictable, as
    they're assigned based on internal server logic. This method is thread-safe when
    called on a valid Channel object.
  warnings: Ensure that the Channel object is valid before calling this method, as
    calling it on a null or destroyed channel may result in undefined behavior. The
    returned ID should not be modified or used to directly manipulate channel data
    without proper server context.
