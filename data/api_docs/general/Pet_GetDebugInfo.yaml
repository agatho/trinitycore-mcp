  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: std::string Pet::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information string for the pet including its GUID, entry ID,
    and current state.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method generates a formatted string containing diagnostic
    information about the Pet object. This includes the pet's unique identifier (GUID),
    creature entry ID, current health and power values, and its current state such
    as whether it is active, summoned, or in combat. The returned string is primarily
    used for debugging purposes during development and testing phases to quickly inspect
    the pet's properties and behavior. This method does not modify any internal state
    of the pet and can be safely called at any time during the pet's lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted debug information about the pet including
    GUID, entry ID, health, power, and current state indicators.

    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    std::string debugInfo\
      \ = myPet->GetDebugInfo();\n    sLog->outString(\"Pet Debug Info: %s\", debugInfo.c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Debug Info in Game Master Commands
    code: "void HandlePetDebugCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    Player* player\
      \ = handler->GetPlayer();\n    Pet* pet = player->GetPet();\n    if (pet)\n\
      \    {\n        std::string debugInfo = pet->GetDebugInfo();\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Pet Debug Info:\\n%s\", debugInfo.c_str());\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      \
      \  handler->SendSysMessage(\"You have no pet.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for debugging and development purposes only. The
    format of the returned string may change between different TrinityCore versions.
    The method performs minimal computation and is thread-safe as it only reads existing
    data without modifying internal state.
