documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the base reputation value for a specified faction entry.
  description: The GetBaseReputation method returns the base reputation amount associated
    with a given faction entry. This value represents the starting reputation level
    that a player has with a specific faction before any modifications or adjustments
    from quests, achievements, or other game mechanics. The method is typically used
    to determine the initial standing of a player towards a particular faction within
    the game's reputation system. It does not account for current reputation modifiers
    or temporary changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the base reputation amount for the
    specified faction entry. This value can be negative, zero, or positive, indicating
    different starting standings (hostile, neutral, friendly, etc.) with the faction.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Base Reputation for a Faction
    code: 'const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(72);

      int32 baseRep = reputationMgr->GetBaseReputation(faction);

      // baseRep will contain the base reputation value for the faction with ID 72'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the internal faction data structure and should only
    be called when a valid FactionEntry pointer is provided. The returned value is
    static and does not reflect any current reputation changes or modifiers that may
    have been applied to the player's standing with the faction.
