  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: GenerateCacheKey
  signature: std::string BotDatabasePool::GenerateCacheKey(const int * stmt) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a cache key string based on the provided SQL statement identifier
    for database query caching.
  description: The GenerateCacheKey method creates a unique cache key by hashing or
    encoding the given SQL statement identifier. This key is used to store and retrieve
    cached database query results within the BotDatabasePool, improving performance
    by avoiding redundant database calls. The method ensures that identical queries
    can be quickly resolved from cache instead of re-executing the same SQL statement.
    It's particularly useful in bot systems where repeated database lookups for similar
    data are common. The generated key is typically used as a lookup identifier in
    an internal caching mechanism.
  parameters:
  - name: stmt
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the SQL statement identifier.
      This value uniquely identifies a specific prepared SQL statement within the
      database pool.
  returns: A std::string containing the generated cache key that can be used for storing
    or retrieving cached query results.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int statementId = 12345;

      std::string cacheKey = botDatabasePool.GenerateCacheKey(&statementId);

      // cacheKey now contains the unique identifier for caching this statement''s
      results'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally within TrinityCore's database pooling
    system. The exact hashing or encoding algorithm used to generate the cache key
    is not specified, but it should produce consistent output for identical input
    values. The method assumes that the input pointer is valid and points to a meaningful
    statement identifier.
  warnings: Ensure that the statement identifier passed to this method is valid and
    corresponds to an actual prepared SQL statement. Passing an invalid or uninitialized
    pointer may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect cache key generation.
