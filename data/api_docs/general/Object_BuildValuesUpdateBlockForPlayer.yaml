  class: Object
  method: BuildValuesUpdateBlockForPlayer
  signature: void Object::BuildValuesUpdateBlockForPlayer(UpdateData * data, const
    Player * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Builds an update block for a specific player containing object data changes.
  description: The BuildValuesUpdateBlockForPlayer method constructs an update packet
    that contains the current state of an object's dynamic fields, specifically tailored
    for a given target player. This method is used internally by the TrinityCore server
    to efficiently send only relevant object updates to players in proximity, reducing
    network overhead. The update data includes changes to object fields such as health,
    mana, orientation, and other dynamic properties that may have changed since the
    last update. It ensures that each player receives only the information they need
    about objects within their view distance.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an UpdateData object where the constructed update block
      will be stored. This parameter must not be null and will be populated with the
      relevant update information.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the update block is being built.
      This determines which fields are included in the update based on visibility
      rules and player-specific conditions. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'UpdateData data;

      Player* targetPlayer = ...; // some valid player

      object->BuildValuesUpdateBlockForPlayer(&data, targetPlayer);

      // Send data to targetPlayer''s client'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in update loop
    code: "void UpdatePlayerObjects(Player* player) {\n    UpdateData data;\n    for\
      \ (auto& obj : visibleObjects) {\n        if (obj->IsType(TYPEMASK_UNIT)) {\n\
      \            obj->BuildValuesUpdateBlockForPlayer(&data, player);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n    player->GetSession()->SendUpdateData(&data);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the update cycle when preparing packets
    for transmission to players. It respects visibility rules and will not send updates
    for objects that are not visible to the target player. The implementation uses
    internal caching mechanisms to avoid unnecessary processing of unchanged fields.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the update system's
    internals. Incorrect usage may result in incomplete or incorrect updates being
    sent to players, potentially causing client-side issues or visual glitches.
