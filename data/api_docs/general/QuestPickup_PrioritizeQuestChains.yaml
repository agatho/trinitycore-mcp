  class: QuestPickup
  method: PrioritizeQuestChains
  signature: void QuestPickup::PrioritizeQuestChains(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes quest chains for the specified player bot based on quest dependencies
    and completion status.
  description: The QuestPickup::PrioritizeQuestChains method organizes and ranks active
    quest chains for a given player bot, ensuring that quests are completed in an
    optimal order. This function evaluates the dependency relationships between quests,
    such as prerequisites and follow-up quests, and adjusts the bot's quest priority
    list accordingly. It is typically used by AI systems to determine which quests
    should be pursued first to maximize efficiency or progress within the game world.
    The method modifies internal quest tracking structures but does not directly interact
    with the player's visible quest log.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest chains
      need prioritization. Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will result
      in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PrioritizeQuestChains
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      QuestPickup::PrioritizeQuestChains(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player's quest data has already been loaded
    and updated. It may trigger internal quest state changes but does not modify the
    player's actual quest log or interact with the game server directly.
