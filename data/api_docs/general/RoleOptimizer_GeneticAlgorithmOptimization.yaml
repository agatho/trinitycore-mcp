documentation:
  brief: Performs genetic algorithm optimization to determine the best group composition
    for a given set of players and constraints
  description: The GeneticAlgorithmOptimization method implements a genetic algorithm
    to find an optimal group composition that meets specified target requirements
    and constraints. It evaluates various possible groupings of players based on their
    roles, stats, and other attributes to maximize fitness according to the defined
    optimization criteria. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft scenarios
    such as raid planning or dungeon grouping where optimal team compositions are
    needed for mission success. The algorithm iterates through multiple generations,
    applying selection, crossover, and mutation operations to evolve better solutions
    until a satisfactory result is achieved.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: The number of players available for group composition optimization
  - name: targetComposition
    description: The desired group composition structure that the algorithm should
      aim to achieve
  - name: constraints
    description: Set of constraints that must be satisfied by any valid group composition,
      such as role requirements, level ranges, or equipment restrictions
  returns: An OptimizationResult object containing the best group composition found
    by the genetic algorithm along with fitness metrics and other optimization details
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      int playerCount = 25;

      GroupComposition target = {"tank": 1, "healer": 3, "dps": 6};

      OptimizationConstraints constraints = {"levelRange": [80, 85], "roles": {"tank":
      true, "healer": true, "dps": true}};

      OptimizationResult result = optimizer.GeneticAlgorithmOptimization(playerCount,
      target, constraints);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with custom fitness function
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint playerCount = 15;\nGroupComposition target\
      \ = {\"tank\": 1, \"healer\": 2, \"dps\": 4};\nOptimizationConstraints constraints\
      \ = {\n    \"levelRange\": [70, 80],\n    \"roles\": {\"tank\": true, \"healer\"\
      : true, \"dps\": true},\n    \"maxDistance\": 10\n};\nOptimizationResult result\
      \ = optimizer.GeneticAlgorithmOptimization(playerCount, target, constraints);\n\
      if (result.isValid()) {\n    std::cout << \"Best composition found: \" << result.getComposition().toString()\
      \ << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Fitness score: \" << result.getFitnessScore()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is computationally intensive and may take several milliseconds
    to complete depending on the complexity of constraints and number of players.
    The genetic algorithm uses a fixed number of generations with configurable population
    size, which can be tuned for performance vs. accuracy trade-offs. The optimization
    process is deterministic given the same inputs but may produce different results
    due to random selection operations.
  warnings: The method assumes that all input parameters are valid and properly initialized.
    Passing invalid or inconsistent constraints may lead to unexpected behavior or
    poor results. The genetic algorithm does not guarantee finding the globally optimal
    solution, only a locally optimal one within the search space defined by the algorithm's
    parameters.
