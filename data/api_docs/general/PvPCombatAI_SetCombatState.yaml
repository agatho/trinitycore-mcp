  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: SetCombatState
  signature: void PvPCombatAI::SetCombatState(int * player, PvPCombatState state)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the combat state for a player in PvP encounters.
  description: The SetCombatState method updates the current combat status of a player
    within the PvP system. This method is typically used by the AI system to manage
    when a player enters or exits combat states, such as during PvP engagements. It
    allows the game engine to track and enforce PvP rules, including preventing certain
    actions while in combat, managing cooldowns, and updating player flags accordingly.
    The method modifies internal state variables that affect how the player interacts
    with other players and the environment during active PvP encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      in the combat system. This typically refers to a player GUID or internal player
      reference used by the AI system.
  - name: state
    description: The PvPCombatState value indicating the desired combat state for
      the player. Valid values include IN_COMBAT, NOT_IN_COMBAT, and other defined
      states within the PvPCombatState enum.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a player into combat
    code: 'PvPCombatAI* ai = ...;

      int playerGuid = 12345;

      PvPCombatState state = IN_COMBAT;

      ai->SetCombatState(&playerGuid, state);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Exiting combat for a player
    code: 'PvPCombatAI* ai = ...;

      int playerGuid = 12345;

      PvPCombatState state = NOT_IN_COMBAT;

      ai->SetCombatState(&playerGuid, state);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal PvP AI system and should only be called
    by the game engine or AI subsystems. The player parameter must point to a valid
    player identifier; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method does not
    directly modify the player's visual state or combat log entries, but rather updates
    internal tracking mechanisms.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid player identifiers as it may cause
    memory corruption or unexpected AI behavior. Ensure that the PvPCombatState value
    passed is valid and defined within the system to avoid undefined states.
