documentation:
  brief: Updates the positioning logic for a Mage AI instance based on current target
    and environmental conditions.
  description: The UpdateMagePositioning method is responsible for calculating and
    applying optimal positional adjustments for a Mage AI character during combat.
    This includes determining ideal distance from the target, evaluating line of sight,
    and adjusting movement patterns to maximize spell effectiveness while maintaining
    safety. The method typically considers factors such as spell range limitations,
    enemy positioning, terrain obstacles, and the Mage's current mana state to make
    intelligent decisions about when and how to reposition. It is called periodically
    during the AI update cycle to ensure the Mage maintains an advantageous position
    throughout combat encounters.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MageAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateMagePositioning();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateCombat()\n{\n    if (m_target && m_target->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        UpdateMagePositioning();\n        CastSpellIfReady();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked within the main AI update loop and should
    not be called excessively without proper cooldowns. The positioning calculations
    may involve pathfinding operations that could impact performance if executed too
    frequently. It assumes that the Mage's target and environment state are properly
    initialized before execution.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid target or in inappropriate combat
    states may lead to erratic movement behavior or invalid positioning decisions.
    Ensure that all prerequisite conditions (target exists, is alive, etc.) are checked
    before invoking this method for optimal results.
