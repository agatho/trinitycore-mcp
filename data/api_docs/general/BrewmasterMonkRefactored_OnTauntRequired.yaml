  class: BrewmasterMonkRefactored
  method: OnTauntRequired
  signature: void BrewmasterMonkRefactored::OnTauntRequired(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the taunt requirement event for the Brewmaster Monk AI, determining
    target for taunting.
  description: The OnTauntRequired method is invoked when the Brewmaster Monk AI needs
    to select a new target for taunting. This method is part of the AI behavior system
    and is typically called during combat situations where the monk must redirect
    enemy attention. The method takes a pointer to an integer representing the current
    target and updates it based on AI logic, such as selecting the nearest threat
    or highest priority enemy. It ensures that the monk maintains proper aggro management
    and follows class-specific taunt mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current target ID. The method
      modifies this value to determine the new taunt target based on AI decision-making
      logic.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taunt Target Selection
    code: "void BrewmasterMonkRefactored::OnTauntRequired(int* target)\n{\n    if\
      \ (!target)\n        return;\n    \n    // Logic to select new taunt target\n\
      \    *target = SelectHighestThreatTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the core AI system during combat updates.
    Developers should ensure that the target pointer is valid before dereferencing
    it. The method should not be used to directly modify creature states, but rather
    to determine appropriate targeting behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is never null when this method is invoked.
    Improper handling of the target pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    in the AI system.
