  class: QuestStrategy
  method: EngageQuestTargets
  signature: void QuestStrategy::EngageQuestTargets(BotAI * ai, const int & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Engages quest targets for the bot AI based on the provided objective.
  description: The EngageQuestTargets method is responsible for initiating combat
    or interaction with quest-related targets within the World of Warcraft environment
    using the TrinityCore AI framework. It takes a BotAI instance and an objective
    identifier to determine which quest target should be engaged. This method typically
    handles the logic required to move towards, attack, or interact with NPCs or objects
    that are part of a quest objective. The method is commonly used in automated bot
    behavior scripts where the AI needs to progress through quest steps automatically.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the bot's behavior and
      decision-making process.
  - name: objective
    description: Integer identifier representing the specific quest objective to engage
      with. This value typically corresponds to a quest step or target index within
      the current quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyQuestStrategy::OnQuestAccept(BotAI* ai, const int& objective)\n\
      {\n    EngageQuestTargets(ai, objective);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "void AdvancedQuestStrategy::ProcessQuestObjective(BotAI* ai, const int&\
      \ objective)\n{\n    if (objective >= 0 && objective < GetMaxQuestObjectives())\n\
      \    {\n        EngageQuestTargets(ai, objective);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n\
      \        // Handle invalid objective\n        ai->GetBot()->Say(\"Invalid quest\
      \ objective.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI instance has been properly initialized
    and that the specified objective is valid for the current quest. The actual engagement
    behavior depends on the implementation of the BotAI's target selection and movement
    logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the objective parameter is within valid range to avoid undefined
    behavior. This method should not be called during critical AI operations where
    state changes might conflict with ongoing actions.
