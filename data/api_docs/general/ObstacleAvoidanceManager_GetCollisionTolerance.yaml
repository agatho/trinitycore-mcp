  method: GetCollisionTolerance
  signature: float ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GetCollisionTolerance() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the collision tolerance value used by the obstacle avoidance manager
    for pathfinding.
  description: The GetCollisionTolerance method retrieves the current collision tolerance
    setting that determines how closely an AI unit will navigate around obstacles.
    This value affects the precision of collision detection during pathfinding calculations,
    with higher values allowing for more lenient avoidance behavior and lower values
    enforcing stricter adherence to obstacle boundaries. The returned float represents
    a distance in yards that defines the minimum safe distance from obstacles during
    movement calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the collision tolerance in yards. This determines
    how aggressively the AI will avoid obstacles during pathfinding, with smaller
    values resulting in tighter avoidance and larger values allowing for more relaxed
    navigation around obstacles.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float tolerance = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager()->GetCollisionTolerance();

      printf("Current collision tolerance: %.2f yards\n", tolerance);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Collision Tolerance in AI Logic
    code: "void CustomAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetMotionMaster()->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager())\n\
      \    {\n        float tolerance = me->GetMotionMaster()->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager()->GetCollisionTolerance();\n\
      \        if (tolerance < 0.5f)\n        {\n            // Handle tight collision\
      \ avoidance case\n            DoSomethingForTightAvoidance();\n        }\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the AI movement system and should
    not be called frequently in performance-critical sections. The default collision
    tolerance value is usually set based on the creature's size and movement type,
    with larger creatures generally having higher tolerance values to account for
    their physical dimensions.
  warnings: Modifying the collision tolerance directly through this getter may not
    have immediate effects if the value is cached or managed by other systems. Always
    verify that changes to obstacle avoidance parameters are properly propagated throughout
    the AI subsystem.
