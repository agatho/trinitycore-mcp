  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadAreaTriggerScripts()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all area trigger scripts from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadAreaTriggerScripts method is responsible for loading area trigger
    scripts from the database table 'areatrigger_scripts' into the ObjectMgr's internal
    data structures. This method is typically called during server startup or when
    reloading scripts to ensure that all defined area trigger events are properly
    registered and ready to be executed when players enter designated areas. It processes
    script entries associated with specific area triggers, linking them to their corresponding
    script functions or behaviors within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadAreaTriggerScripts();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading scripts. It is not thread-safe and should be executed in a single-threaded
    context to prevent race conditions. The method assumes that the database connection
    is already established and that the 'areatrigger_scripts' table contains valid
    data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    duplicate script registrations. Ensure that any existing area trigger scripts
    are properly cleared before reloading to avoid memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
