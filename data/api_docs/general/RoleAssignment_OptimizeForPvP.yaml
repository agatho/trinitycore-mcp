api:
  class: RoleAssignment
  method: OptimizeForPvP
  signature: void RoleAssignment::OptimizeForPvP(Group * group, uint32 battlegroundId)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes role assignments within a group for optimal performance in PvP
    battlegrounds.
  description: The OptimizeForPvP method adjusts role assignments within a specified
    group to enhance performance and coordination during PvP battles. It analyzes
    the current composition of the group, including player classes, roles, and gear,
    and reassigns roles to maximize effectiveness in battleground scenarios. This
    method is typically invoked when a group enters a PvP environment such as Alterac
    Valley, Warsong Gulch, or Eye of the Storm. The optimization process ensures that
    each player's role aligns with their capabilities and the tactical needs of the
    battleground, improving overall team performance.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players to be optimized for
      PvP. Must not be null.
  - name: battlegroundId
    description: Identifier of the battleground type where optimization is applied.
      Used to determine specific role strategies and class requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground Entry
    code: "void OnBattlegroundEnter(Player* player, uint32 battlegroundId)\n{\n  \
      \  Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n        RoleAssignment::OptimizeForPvP(group,\
      \ battlegroundId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Custom Role Logic
    code: "void OptimizeGroupForBattleground(Group* group, uint32 bgId)\n{\n    if\
      \ (!group || !group->IsInBattleground())\n        return;\n    \n    // Perform\
      \ additional checks before optimization\n    if (bgId == BATTLEGROUND_AV ||\
      \ bgId == BATTLEGROUND_WS)\n        RoleAssignment::OptimizeForPvP(group, bgId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is already formed and contains valid players.
    It modifies internal role assignments but does not alter player stats or equipment
    directly. The optimization logic considers class-specific roles (e.g., healer,
    tank, damage dealer) and adjusts them based on battleground requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent
    crashes. Do not call this method outside of battleground contexts unless you're
    certain about the intended behavior. Improper usage may lead to incorrect role
    assignments affecting gameplay balance.
