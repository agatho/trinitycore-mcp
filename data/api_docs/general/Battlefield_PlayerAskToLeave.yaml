  class: Battlefield

  signature: void Battlefield::PlayerAskToLeave(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Handles a player's request to leave a battlefield.
  description: The PlayerAskToLeave method processes a player's attempt to exit a
    battlefield instance. This method is typically invoked when a player uses the
    leave battlefield interface or command. It manages the necessary cleanup and state
    transitions for the player's departure from the battlefield, including removing
    the player from battlefield-related systems, updating internal tracking structures,
    and potentially triggering related events or notifications. The method ensures
    proper synchronization of player state with the battlefield's internal management
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object requesting to leave the battlefield.
      Must be a valid player instance that is currently participating in a battlefield.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PlayerAskToLeave
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      battlefield->PlayerAskToLeave(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called for players who are actively participating
    in a battlefield. It is typically invoked internally by the game system when a
    player attempts to leave, but can also be called directly from other systems that
    need to forcibly remove a player.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null player pointer may result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure the player is actually in a battlefield before calling
    this method.
