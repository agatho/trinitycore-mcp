  class: VMapManager2
  method: IsVMAPDisabledForDummy
  signature: bool VMapManager2::IsVMAPDisabledForDummy(uint32 param0, uint8 param1)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether VMAP (Virtual Map) functionality is disabled for a specific
    dummy object.
  description: The IsVMAPDisabledForDummy method determines if the Virtual Map system
    is disabled for a particular dummy object identified by its parameters. This functionality
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to control whether certain
    game objects or areas should use VMAP-based collision detection and line-of-sight
    calculations. The method likely checks internal flags or configuration settings
    related to dummy objects within the VMapManager2 system. It can be important for
    performance optimization or specific gameplay mechanics where VMAP behavior needs
    to be overridden for certain objects.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: First parameter, likely representing an object identifier or type
      ID used to identify the dummy object in the VMap system.
  - name: param1
    description: Second parameter, possibly indicating a sub-type, instance, or configuration
      flag for the dummy object within the VMap manager.
  returns: Returns true if VMAP functionality is disabled for the specified dummy
    object; otherwise returns false. This indicates that collision detection and line-of-sight
    checks should not be performed using VMAP data for this object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check VMAP status
    code: "if (VMapManager2::Instance()->IsVMAPDisabledForDummy(12345, 1)) {\n   \
      \ // Handle case where VMAP is disabled for this dummy object\n    printf(\"\
      VMAP is disabled for dummy object with ID 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's VMapManager2 system which handles virtual
    map data for line-of-sight and collision detection. The exact implementation details
    depend on how dummy objects are registered and configured within the VMap system.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values may lead to unexpected behavior or false results
    when checking VMAP status. Ensure that the parameters passed correspond to valid
    dummy object identifiers used by the game's VMap system.
