  class: GroupStateMachine
  method: ForceState
  signature: void GroupStateMachine::ForceState(GroupState newState)
documentation:
  brief: Immediately transitions the group state machine to the specified new state
    without validation.
  description: The ForceState method directly sets the internal state of a GroupStateMachine
    instance to the provided GroupState value. This method bypasses normal state transition
    logic and validation checks, making it a powerful but potentially dangerous operation.
    It is typically used for emergency state resets, debugging, or when immediate
    state changes are required regardless of current group conditions. The method
    does not perform any sanity checks on the new state value, so callers must ensure
    that the provided state is valid for the current context. This can be particularly
    useful in scenarios where a group needs to be forcibly reset to a known baseline
    state during server maintenance or when handling corrupted group data.
  parameters:
  - name: newState
    description: The target GroupState value to force the state machine into. Must
      be a valid enum value from the GroupState enumeration. This parameter is required
      and cannot be ignored.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Force group to idle state
    code: 'GroupStateMachine* groupSM = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupStateMachine();

      groupSM->ForceState(GROUP_STATE_IDLE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Emergency group reset
    code: "if (group->IsInCombat()) {\n    // Force group to a clean state regardless\
      \ of combat status\n    group->GetGroupStateMachine()->ForceState(GROUP_STATE_NONE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used sparingly as it can lead to inconsistent group
    states if not properly managed. It's recommended to use this only in controlled
    environments such as server-side debugging or emergency recovery scenarios. The
    method does not trigger any state change events or callbacks, so dependent systems
    may not be notified of the transition.
  warnings: Using ForceState can cause unexpected behavior in group operations if
    the new state is incompatible with current group conditions. It bypasses all normal
    validation and should never be called during active gameplay operations without
    careful consideration of side effects. Improper usage may lead to crashes or inconsistent
    group member states.
