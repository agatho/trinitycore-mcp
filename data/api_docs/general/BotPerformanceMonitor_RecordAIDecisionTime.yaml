  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordAIDecisionTime
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordAIDecisionTime(uint32_t botGuid, uint64_t
    microseconds, const std::string & context)
documentation:
  brief: Records the time taken for a bot to make an AI decision, including context
    and performance metrics.
  description: The RecordAIDecisionTime method logs timing data for AI decision-making
    processes performed by bots within the TrinityCore framework. This method captures
    the duration in microseconds along with contextual information to help monitor
    and optimize bot performance. It is typically invoked during AI processing phases
    where decision latency needs to be tracked for debugging, profiling, or balancing
    purposes. The recorded data can be used to identify performance bottlenecks in
    bot behavior scripts or to ensure that AI decisions are made within acceptable
    time limits for smooth gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the AI decision time
      is being recorded. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity in the game
      world.
  - name: microseconds
    description: The elapsed time, in microseconds, taken by the bot to complete its
      AI decision process. This metric should be measured using high-resolution timing
      functions.
  - name: context
    description: A descriptive string providing context about the AI decision being
      recorded, such as 'Movement', 'Combat', or 'Target Selection'. Used for categorizing
      performance data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64_t startTime = getTickCount();

      // Simulate AI decision logic here

      uint64_t endTime = getTickCount();

      botPerformanceMonitor->RecordAIDecisionTime(botGuid, endTime - startTime, "Combat
      Decision");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Contexts
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // AI logic for pathfinding

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      uint64_t duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start).count();

      botPerformanceMonitor->RecordAIDecisionTime(botGuid, duration, "Pathfinding");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and non-blocking. It should not
    significantly impact bot performance during regular operation. The context string
    helps categorize performance data for analysis tools and dashboards.
