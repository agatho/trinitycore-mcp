documentation:
  brief: Converts a raid group into a standard group.
  description: The ConvertToGroup method transforms a raid group into a regular group
    by removing all raid-specific functionality and converting it to a standard group
    structure. This operation is typically used when a raid needs to be broken down
    into smaller, independent groups or when transitioning from raid to dungeon group
    mechanics. The method ensures that all players in the raid are moved to the new
    group structure while maintaining their individual roles and positions within
    the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Convert raid group to standard group
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup && raidGroup->isRaidGroup())\
      \ {\n    raidGroup->ConvertToGroup();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on raid groups. Calling it on a regular
    group may result in undefined behavior. The conversion process preserves all player
    data and group membership but removes raid-specific flags and functionality.
  warnings: Calling ConvertToGroup on a non-raid group may lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes. Ensure the group is actually a raid group before calling this method.
