documentation:
  brief: Handles a player's request to exit a vehicle they are currently riding.
  description: The HandleRequestVehicleExit method processes a client-side packet
    that indicates a player wants to disembark from their current vehicle. This method
    is part of the WorldSession class and is invoked when the player sends a vehicle
    exit request to the server. It validates the request, checks if the player is
    indeed riding a vehicle, and then initiates the process of removing the player
    from the vehicle. The method ensures that the player's position and state are
    properly updated after exiting the vehicle, including resetting their movement
    flags and updating their character state in the game world.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestVehicleExit(WorldPackets::Vehicle::RequestVehicleExit&\
      \ requestVehicleExit)\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n   \
      \     if (player->IsInVehicle())\n        {\n            player->ExitVehicle();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the packet handling system in
    TrinityCore. It's important to note that vehicle exit requests are only processed
    if the player is actually riding a vehicle. The method does not directly send
    any response packets back to the client; it relies on other systems to update
    the client state.
