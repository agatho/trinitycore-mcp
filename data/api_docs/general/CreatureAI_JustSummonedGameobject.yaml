  class: CreatureAI

  signature: void CreatureAI::JustSummonedGameobject(GameObject * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a GameObject is summoned by the CreatureAI, allowing custom behavior
    execution.
  description: The JustSummonedGameobject method is a virtual callback function in
    the CreatureAI class that is invoked immediately after a GameObject has been successfully
    summoned by the creature. This method allows developers to implement custom logic
    or actions that should occur when a summoned GameObject becomes active in the
    game world. It serves as an event handler for summoning events, enabling AI scripts
    to react to summoned objects such as traps, guardians, or other interactive elements.
    The method is typically used in conjunction with summoning mechanics within creature
    AI behavior trees or custom AI implementations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the GameObject that was summoned by the creature. This
      parameter provides access to the summoned object's properties and methods for
      further manipulation or interaction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustSummonedGameobject(GameObject*\
      \ go) override\n    {\n        // Log that a GameObject was summoned\n     \
      \   TC_LOG_INFO(\"sql.sql\", \"Creature %u summoned GameObject %u\", GetCreature()->GetEntry(),\
      \ go->GetEntry());\n        \n        // Example: Set the summoned object to\
      \ despawn after 10 seconds\n        go->SetRespawnTime(10);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "class BossAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustSummonedGameobject(GameObject*\
      \ go) override\n    {\n        // Check if the summoned object is a specific\
      \ type (e.g., a trap)\n        if (go->GetEntry() == 12345)\n        {\n   \
      \         // Apply special effects or set initial state\n            go->SetUInt32Value(GAMEOBJECT_FLAGS,\
      \ GO_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n            \n            // Schedule destruction\
      \ after delay\n            GetCreature()->m_Events.AddEvent([go]()\n       \
      \     {\n                if (go)\n                    go->Delete();\n      \
      \      }, 30000); // Destroy after 30 seconds\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI virtual function interface and should
    be overridden in custom AI implementations. The GameObject pointer passed to this
    method is guaranteed to be valid at the time of invocation, but developers should
    verify that it's not null before using it. This method is called from within the
    context of the creature's AI update loop, so performance considerations apply.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations or blocking calls in this method as
    it may impact AI responsiveness. Also, be cautious about modifying or deleting
    the GameObject pointer directly without proper checks, as it could lead to dangling
    pointers or crashes if not handled carefully.
