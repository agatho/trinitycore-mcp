  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: SelectStrategy
  signature: CombatPositionStrategy RoleBasedCombatPositioning::SelectStrategy(const
    CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the appropriate combat positioning strategy based on the provided
    context.
  description: The SelectStrategy method determines the most suitable combat positioning
    approach for a unit within the World of Warcraft environment, utilizing data from
    the CombatPositionContext. This method evaluates various factors such as target
    proximity, threat level, and unit role to decide whether to engage, maintain distance,
    or reposition. It is typically invoked during AI decision-making processes to
    optimize positioning for effective combat performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a CombatPositionStrategy enum value indicating the selected positioning
    strategy. Possible values may include ENGAGE, DEFENSIVE, OFFENSIVE, or REPOSITION
    depending on contextual analysis.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "CombatPositionStrategy strategy = roleBasedCombatPositioning.SelectStrategy(context);\n\
      switch (strategy)\n{\n    case CombatPositionStrategy::ENGAGE:\n        // Move\
      \ towards target\n        break;\n    case CombatPositionStrategy::DEFENSIVE:\n\
      \        // Maintain distance and defend\n        break;\n    case CombatPositionStrategy::OFFENSIVE:\n\
      \        // Aggressive positioning\n        break;\n    case CombatPositionStrategy::REPOSITION:\n\
      \        // Change position for better angle\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI subsystem and should be called within appropriate
    game loop contexts to ensure real-time positioning decisions. The context parameter
    must contain valid data for accurate strategy selection.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatPositionContext passed to this method contains all
    required fields; missing or invalid data may lead to inappropriate positioning
    decisions. This method does not perform any validation on input parameters.
