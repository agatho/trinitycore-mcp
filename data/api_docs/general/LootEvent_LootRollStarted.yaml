  class: LootEvent
  method: LootRollStarted
  signature: LootEvent LootEvent::LootRollStarted(int item, uint32 entry)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new LootEvent object representing the start of a loot
    roll for a specific item.
  description: The LootRollStarted method is used to generate a LootEvent instance
    that signifies the beginning of a loot rolling process for a particular item in
    World of Warcraft. This event is typically triggered when an item is dropped and
    players must decide whether to roll for it using the standard loot system. The
    method takes an item identifier and an entry ID to properly initialize the event
    object, which can then be used by the game's event handling systems to manage
    player interactions during loot distribution. This method is part of the core
    loot management functionality within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: The identifier of the item for which the loot roll is starting. This
      typically corresponds to an item template ID or internal item reference used
      by the game engine.
  - name: entry
    description: The entry ID associated with the loot item. This value identifies
      the specific loot entry in the database and is used to determine which players
      can participate in the roll.
  returns: Returns a new LootEvent object initialized with the provided item and entry
    parameters, representing the start of a loot rolling process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: LootEvent event = LootEvent::LootRollStarted(12345, 67890);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Loot Handling
    code: "void HandleItemDrop(Player* player, uint32 itemId) {\n    uint32 entryId\
      \ = GetLootEntryForItem(itemId);\n    LootEvent event = LootEvent::LootRollStarted(itemId,\
      \ entryId);\n    // Process the loot event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a valid loot item is available for
    rolling. The returned LootEvent object must be properly handled by the game's
    event system to ensure correct player interaction during loot distribution. The
    method assumes that both parameters are valid and non-zero, as invalid values
    may lead to undefined behavior in the loot system.
  warnings: Ensure that the item parameter corresponds to an actual item in the game
    database, otherwise the loot roll may fail or cause errors. Avoid calling this
    method outside of appropriate game contexts such as during world initialization
    or when no valid loot is available.
