documentation:
  brief: Clears all threat entries from the bot's threat manager.
  description: The ClearAllThreat method removes all threat values associated with
    targets in the BotThreatManager. This function is typically used to reset the
    threat state of a bot, ensuring that it no longer has any recorded threat towards
    NPCs or players. It effectively resets the internal threat table, making the bot
    appear as if it has not engaged in combat with any entities. The method does not
    take any parameters and performs no return operations. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining proper AI behavior when switching targets or restarting combat
    scenarios.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotThreatManager* threatManager = bot->GetThreatManager();

      threatManager->ClearAllThreat();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully during combat state transitions to
    avoid unexpected behavior. It is recommended to use this function only when the
    bot's threat state needs to be completely reset, such as before initiating a new
    target selection process.
  warnings: Calling ClearAllThreat() while the bot is actively engaged in combat may
    cause unpredictable AI behavior or lead to immediate re-engagement with previous
    targets if not handled properly. Ensure that this function is used in appropriate
    contexts where threat state reset is intended and safe.
