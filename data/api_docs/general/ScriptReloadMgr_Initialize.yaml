documentation:
  brief: Initializes the script reload manager to prepare for dynamic script reloading
    functionality.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the ScriptReloadMgr class to handle dynamic
    reloading of scripts at runtime. This method prepares internal data structures,
    registers necessary callbacks, and ensures the system is ready to process script
    reload requests. It typically gets called during server startup or when enabling
    dynamic script reloading features. The initialization process may involve setting
    up event handlers, loading configuration settings, and preparing caches for efficient
    script reloading operations. This method should only be called once during the
    application lifecycle to avoid potential conflicts or undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: ScriptReloadMgr::instance()->Initialize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any script reload operations are attempted.
    It is typically invoked during server initialization phase and may not be safe
    to call after the system has started processing reload requests.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to undefined
    behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that no active script reloading operations are
    in progress before calling this method.
