  class: BotLifecycleMgr
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: LifecycleStatistics BotLifecycleMgr::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves comprehensive lifecycle statistics for all active bot instances
    managed by the BotLifecycleMgr.
  description: The GetStatistics method aggregates and returns detailed lifecycle
    metrics for all bots currently under management. This includes information such
    as total bot count, active sessions, creation timestamps, and operational status.
    The returned LifecycleStatistics object provides a snapshot of the current state
    of bot operations within the system. This method is typically used for monitoring,
    debugging, or administrative purposes to understand how many bots are running,
    their statuses, and overall system utilization. No parameters are required as
    it operates on the internal state of the BotLifecycleMgr instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LifecycleStatistics object containing aggregated data about all managed
    bot instances, including counts, status indicators, and timing information related
    to bot lifecycle events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Bot Statistics
    code: 'LifecycleStatistics stats = botLifecycleMgr.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total Bots: " << stats.totalBots << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Active Bots: " << stats.activeBots << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only operation on internal bot state data and
    should not modify any managed entities. It is designed to be thread-safe for concurrent
    access, but performance may degrade if called excessively during high bot activity
    periods.
  warnings: The returned statistics object reflects the state at the time of invocation
    and may become stale quickly in dynamic environments with frequent bot creation/destruction.
    Avoid relying on this data for real-time decision-making without re-fetching.
