  signature: void BotSpawner::DespawnAllBots()
documentation:
  brief: Despawns all active bot creatures controlled by the BotSpawner instance.
  description: The DespawnAllBots method removes all currently spawned bot creatures
    from the game world that are managed by this BotSpawner instance. This operation
    typically occurs when cleaning up or resetting bot behavior, such as during server
    shutdown, player logout, or when bots are no longer needed. The method ensures
    that all associated bot entities are properly removed from the map and their resources
    are freed. It does not affect the configuration or state of the BotSpawner itself,
    only the active spawned creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSpawner* spawner = new BotSpawner();

      // ... spawn some bots ...

      spawner->DespawnAllBots(); // Remove all spawned bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through a list or container of active bot creatures
    and calls their individual despawn logic. It may also reset internal tracking
    variables to reflect that no bots are currently active.
