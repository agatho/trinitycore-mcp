  class: Unit
  method: GetDemonCreatorGUID
  signature: int Unit::GetDemonCreatorGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the creature that created this demon.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the creature
    that originally summoned or created the current demon unit. The method is typically
    used in the context of demon summoning mechanics, where a player or NPC may summon
    a demon and then track which entity created it. This information is crucial for
    determining the source of a summoned demon, especially when dealing with multiple
    summoning sources or when the demon needs to be tracked for quest completion or
    reward purposes. The method returns an integer value representing the GUID of
    the creator.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the GUID of the creature that created
    this demon. If no creator exists, it may return 0 or a negative value depending
    on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nint creatorGUID = unit->GetDemonCreatorGUID();\n\
      if (creatorGUID > 0)\n{\n    // Demon was created by a valid creature\n    printf(\"\
      Demon creator GUID: %d\\n\", creatorGUID);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No creator found\
      \ or invalid GUID\n    printf(\"No valid creator found\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other demon-related methods
    such as GetSummonedCreatureGUID or GetOwnerGUID. It may be subject to performance
    considerations when used frequently in loop contexts. The method should be thread-safe
    if used in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method, as incorrect usage can lead
    to invalid GUID references or incorrect tracking of summoning sources. Ensure
    that the demon unit is properly initialized before calling this method.
