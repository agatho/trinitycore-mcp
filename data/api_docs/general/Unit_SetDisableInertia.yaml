  class: Unit
  method: SetDisableInertia
  signature: bool Unit::SetDisableInertia(bool disable)
documentation:
  brief: Disables or enables inertia for the unit, affecting movement behavior.
  description: This method controls whether inertia is disabled for the specified
    unit, which influences how movement mechanics behave during movement operations.
    When disabled, the unit will not maintain momentum after stopping, and when enabled,
    it will retain momentum. This is particularly useful for controlling player or
    creature movement behavior in specific scenarios such as combat or special effects.
    The method returns true if the inertia state was successfully changed, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the inertia state was successfully set to the specified
    value, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = GetPlayer();\nbool result = unit->SetDisableInertia(true);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Inertia is now disabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects movement behavior directly and should be used carefully
    during active gameplay. It may impact performance if used frequently in rapid
    succession.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause unexpected movement behavior, especially
    when dealing with player-controlled units or creatures that are actively moving.
