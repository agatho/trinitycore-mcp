  signature: void Unit::PropagateSpeedChange()
documentation:
  brief: Propagates speed changes to nearby units and updates movement speed accordingly.
  description: The PropagateSpeedChange method is responsible for updating the movement
    speed of a unit based on its current speed modifications. This method ensures
    that all nearby units are notified of any speed changes, which is crucial for
    maintaining synchronization in World of Warcraft gameplay mechanics. It typically
    occurs when a unit's speed is modified due to effects like snare, haste, or other
    movement-related buffs or debuffs. The method handles the propagation of these
    speed changes across the game world, ensuring that affected units properly update
    their movement behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->PropagateSpeedChange();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during speed modification events and may
    involve complex calculations involving movement speed modifiers. Performance considerations
    include avoiding unnecessary calls when speed changes are not active, as it can
    impact server performance.
  warnings: Improper handling of speed changes can lead to synchronization issues
    between players and NPCs, potentially causing client-side discrepancies or movement
    glitches.
