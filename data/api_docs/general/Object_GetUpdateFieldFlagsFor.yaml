  signature: int Object::GetUpdateFieldFlagsFor(const Player * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines update field flags for a specific player target.
  description: This method calculates and returns the update field flags that should
    be applied to a given player's update fields when interacting with the current
    object. It is primarily used in the context of World of Warcraft's packet system
    to determine what data should be sent to a player's client during updates. The
    method considers various factors including object visibility, player's team, and
    object type to determine appropriate flags for update packets.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the update field flags that should
    be applied to the target player's update fields. This value is typically used
    in conjunction with the Object::BuildUpdateDataFor method to construct proper
    update packets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int flags = object->GetUpdateFieldFlagsFor(player);

      // Use flags to determine what data to send in update packet'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's update system and
    should not be called directly by developers. The returned flags are based on player's
    visibility and object type, which affects how the client receives updates.
