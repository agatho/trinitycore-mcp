api:
  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetSpellRange
  signature: int EvokerAI::GetSpellRange(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the range of a specified spell for the evoker AI.
  description: The GetSpellRange method returns the maximum casting range, in yards,
    for a given spell ID within the context of the EvokerAI class. This method is
    used to determine how far an evoker can cast a specific spell from its current
    position. The returned value represents the spell's effective range as defined
    by the game's spell database and may be influenced by factors such as the evoker's
    current state, buffs, or debuffs. This functionality is essential for AI decision-making
    processes that involve spell selection and targeting.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to retrieve the range.
      Must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  returns: An integer representing the spell's maximum casting range in yards. Returns
    0 if the spell ID is invalid or not found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve spell range for a basic evoker spell
    code: "int range = evokerAI->GetSpellRange(12345); // Gets range for Fireball\
      \ spell\nif (range > 0) {\n    // Use the range to determine if target is within\
      \ cast distance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell data and should only be called after
    ensuring that the spell ID exists in the database. The returned value may vary
    depending on the evoker's current condition, such as whether it is in combat or
    affected by movement-imposing effects.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spellId may result in a return value
    of 0, which could lead to incorrect AI behavior if not properly checked. Ensure
    all spell IDs passed are validated before calling this function.
