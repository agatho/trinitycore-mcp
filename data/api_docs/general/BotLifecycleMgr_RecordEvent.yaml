  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::RecordEvent(LifecycleEventInfo::Type eventType,
    uint32 processingTimeMs)
documentation:
  brief: Records a lifecycle event with associated processing time for bot management.
  description: The RecordEvent method logs a specific lifecycle event type along with
    its processing duration in milliseconds. This functionality is used within the
    TrinityCore bot management system to track and analyze the performance and behavior
    of AI-controlled characters (bots). The recorded events help in monitoring bot
    initialization, updates, and termination processes, enabling developers and administrators
    to optimize bot behavior and resource usage. The method does not return any value
    but contributes to internal event tracking mechanisms that may be used for debugging,
    performance analysis, or statistical reporting.
  parameters:
  - name: eventType
    description: Specifies the type of lifecycle event being recorded. This is typically
      an enumeration value indicating whether the event relates to bot creation, update,
      destruction, or other lifecycle phases.
  - name: processingTimeMs
    description: The time taken in milliseconds to complete the associated lifecycle
      operation. This value helps measure performance and identify bottlenecks in
      bot processing routines.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a Bot Creation Event
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::Instance()->RecordEvent(LifecycleEventInfo::Type::BOT_CREATED,
      150);
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Bot Update Performance
    code: 'uint32 updateTime = GetUpdateTime();

      BotLifecycleMgr::Instance()->RecordEvent(LifecycleEventInfo::Type::BOT_UPDATED,
      updateTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal event logging system that aggregates
    performance data for bot operations. It may be used in conjunction with other
    lifecycle management functions to provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities.
    The processing time measurement includes all operations performed during the event,
    such as memory allocation, AI decision-making, and state updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the eventType parameter is valid and corresponds to defined
    lifecycle event types to avoid incorrect logging or potential runtime errors.
    Since this method does not return a value, it should be used primarily for tracking
    purposes rather than conditional logic.
