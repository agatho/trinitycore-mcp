  signature: void ObjectMgr::SetHighestGuids()
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal tracking of the highest GUIDs used for various object types
    in the database.
  description: The SetHighestGuids method is responsible for retrieving and setting
    the highest globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) currently in use for different
    object types such as players, creatures, game objects, items, and groups within
    the TrinityCore world. This ensures that new objects are assigned unique GUIDs
    that do not conflict with existing ones. The method typically runs during server
    startup or database synchronization to initialize internal state. It reads from
    the database to determine the maximum GUID values for each type and updates the
    corresponding internal counters in the ObjectMgr singleton.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Server Startup Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n\
      \    sObjectMgr->SetHighestGuids();\n    // ... continue with rest of startup\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    synchronizing GUIDs from a database that has been modified externally. It's crucial
    for maintaining data integrity and preventing GUID collisions in multi-threaded
    environments where multiple threads might create objects concurrently.
  warnings: Calling this method after the server has started and objects have already
    been created may lead to GUID conflicts if not handled carefully. It should never
    be invoked while active game sessions are running unless proper synchronization
    is in place.
