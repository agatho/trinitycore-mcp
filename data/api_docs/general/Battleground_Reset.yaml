documentation:
  brief: Resets the battleground to its initial state, clearing all players and objectives.
  description: The Reset method is responsible for returning a battleground to its
    default, uninitialized state. This includes removing all players from the battlefield,
    clearing any active objectives or scoring systems, and preparing the battleground
    for a new match. The method ensures that all game state related to the battleground
    is cleared and reset, allowing it to be reused for subsequent matches. It is typically
    called when a battleground ends or needs to be reinitialized before a new round
    begins.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(123);

      bg->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the battleground is in a state where
    it can safely be reset, such as after a match has concluded or during initialization.
    It does not handle player disconnection or cleanup beyond clearing the battleground
    itself.
