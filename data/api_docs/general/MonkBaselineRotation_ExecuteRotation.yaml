  class: MonkBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool MonkBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target, BaselineRotationManager
    & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the baseline monk rotation logic for a bot character.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method implements the core decision-making logic
    for a monk bot's combat behavior. It evaluates the current game state, including
    player health, mana, target conditions, and available abilities, to determine
    the optimal next action in the rotation sequence. The method interacts with the
    BaselineRotationManager to manage cooldowns, resource tracking, and rotation state.
    This function is typically called during combat situations where the bot needs
    to make tactical decisions about which abilities to use next.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot character's data structure containing player state
      information such as health, mana, and current abilities.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target character's data structure containing enemy
      state information including health, position, and status effects.
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager instance that tracks rotation
      state, cooldowns, and manages the overall rotation logic flow.
  returns: Returns true if the rotation was successfully executed and a valid action
    was performed, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that
    no suitable action could be determined or that the bot is in an invalid state
    for rotation execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic rotation execution
    code: "int botData[10];\nint targetData[10];\nBaselineRotationManager manager;\n\
      MonkBaselineRotation rotation;\nbool result = rotation.ExecuteRotation(botData,\
      \ targetData, manager);\nif (result) {\n    // Rotation executed successfully\n\
      } else {\n    // No valid action could be determined\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat loop
    code: "void CombatLoop() {\n    while (IsInCombat()) {\n        int bot[20];\n\
      \        int target[20];\n        BaselineRotationManager manager;\n       \
      \ \n        // Update bot and target states\n        UpdateBotState(bot);\n\
      \        UpdateTargetState(target);\n        \n        // Execute rotation\n\
      \        if (!monkRotation.ExecuteRotation(bot, target, manager)) {\n      \
      \      // Handle failure case - possibly switch to defensive mode\n        \
      \    break;\n        }\n        \n        // Wait for next tick or action completion\n\
      \        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on accurate state data being passed through the
    bot and target pointers. The BaselineRotationManager must be properly initialized
    before calling this function to ensure correct cooldown tracking and rotation
    state management. Performance is critical during combat as this method may be
    called frequently, so it should avoid expensive operations or blocking calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and target data structures are valid and properly
    populated before calling this method. Passing null pointers or uninitialized data
    will likely result in undefined behavior. The method assumes that all required
    game state information is available through the provided pointers and manager
    instance.
