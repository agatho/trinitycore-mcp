  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void BotProfiler::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the bot profiler functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the bot profiler is active or
    inactive. When enabled, the profiler will collect and log performance data about
    bot behavior and AI decisions. When disabled, profiling is suspended and no additional
    data is recorded. This method is typically used to control profiling during testing
    or debugging sessions without restarting the server. The change takes effect immediately
    and affects all bots currently managed by the profiler.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the bot profiler
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Bot Profiler
    code: BotProfiler::SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bot Profiler
    code: BotProfiler::SetEnabled(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a global state that affects all bots in the system.
    It's recommended to call this method during server initialization or when transitioning
    between different testing phases. The profiler state persists across bot creation
    and destruction, so enabling it after creating bots will start profiling those
    existing bots as well.
