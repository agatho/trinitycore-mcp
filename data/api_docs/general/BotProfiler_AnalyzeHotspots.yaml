api:
  class: BotProfiler
  method: AnalyzeHotspots
  signature: int BotProfiler::AnalyzeHotspots(uint64_t sessionId, uint32_t topN)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and returns the top N hotspots for a given session ID based on bot
    activity patterns.
  description: The AnalyzeHotspots method processes historical data from a specified
    session to identify and rank the most frequently visited or significant locations
    (hotspots) within the game world. This functionality is typically used by the
    TrinityCore bot system to optimize pathfinding, resource allocation, and behavior
    patterns for automated players. The method requires a valid session ID to retrieve
    associated data and returns an integer indicating success or failure of the analysis
    operation. It may involve processing large datasets of player movement and interaction
    logs to determine hotspot relevance.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier for the bot session to analyze. Must be a valid
      uint64_t value representing an active session in the system.
  - name: topN
    description: The number of top hotspots to return. Specifies how many ranked locations
      should be included in the result, with higher values returning more data points.
  returns: 'Returns an integer value indicating the outcome of the analysis: 0 for
    success, negative values for errors (e.g., invalid session ID, insufficient data),
    and positive values for warnings or partial results.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hotspot Analysis
    code: int result = botProfiler.AnalyzeHotspots(1234567890ULL, 5);
    language: cpp
  - title: Retrieve Top 10 Hotspots for Session
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = player->GetSession()->GetAccountId();\nint result\
      \ = botProfiler.AnalyzeHotspots(sessionId, 10);\nif (result == 0) {\n    //\
      \ Process top 10 hotspots\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs intensive data processing and may block execution
    until analysis is complete. It should be called asynchronously or during low-traffic
    periods to avoid impacting gameplay performance. The accuracy of hotspot detection
    depends on the quality and volume of historical session data available.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or inactive session ID will likely
    result in error codes. Ensure that the session exists and has sufficient recorded
    activity before invoking this function to prevent unnecessary processing overhead.
