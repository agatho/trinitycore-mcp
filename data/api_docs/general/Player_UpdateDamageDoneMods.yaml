  signature: void Player::UpdateDamageDoneMods(int attackType, int32 skipEnchantSlot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates damage modifiers for the player's attacks based on current equipment
    and buffs.
  description: The UpdateDamageDoneMods method recalculates and applies all damage-related
    modifiers to the player's attacks. This includes adjustments from equipped weapons,
    enchantments, buffs, debuffs, and other game mechanics that affect attack power
    or damage output. The method takes into account the specified attack type and
    optionally skips updates for a specific enchantment slot to optimize performance
    during bulk operations. It is typically called when equipment changes, buffs expire,
    or combat state transitions occur.
  parameters:
  - name: attackType
    description: Specifies the type of attack to update modifiers for. Valid values
      include melee attacks (0), ranged attacks (1), and spell attacks (2). This determines
      which damage calculations are updated.
  - name: skipEnchantSlot
    description: Optional parameter that specifies an enchantment slot index to skip
      during the update process. Set to -1 to update all slots, or provide a valid
      enchantment slot index to exclude it from recalculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update all melee damage modifiers
    code: player->UpdateDamageDoneMods(0); // Update melee attack damage modifiers
    language: cpp
  - title: Update ranged damage while skipping a specific enchantment slot
    code: player->UpdateDamageDoneMods(1, EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND); // Update ranged
      damage but skip main hand enchantment
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine when equipment
    changes or combat state updates occur. It may trigger recalculations of attack
    power, critical strike chance, and other damage-related stats. The skipEnchantSlot
    parameter allows for performance optimization in scenarios where multiple updates
    are needed.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper context may cause inconsistent
    stat calculations. Ensure that any manual calls are made during appropriate game
    state transitions to avoid visual discrepancies or gameplay bugs.
