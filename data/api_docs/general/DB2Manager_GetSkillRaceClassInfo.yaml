  signature: int DB2Manager::GetSkillRaceClassInfo(uint32 skill) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the skill race class information for a given skill ID.
  description: The GetSkillRaceClassInfo method retrieves specific information related
    to how skills are associated with race and class combinations in the game. This
    function is typically used to determine which races and classes can learn or use
    a particular skill. It accesses internal DB2 data structures that store skill-related
    race and class mappings. The method returns an integer identifier that corresponds
    to the skill's race-class association, which may be used for validation or lookup
    purposes within the game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the skill race class info identifier.
    A return value of -1 typically indicates that no valid mapping was found for the
    given skill ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int skillInfo = sDB2Manager->GetSkillRaceClassInfo(129); // Retrieves info\
      \ for First Aid skill\nif (skillInfo != -1)\n{\n    printf(\"Skill has race/class\
      \ info: %d\\n\", skillInfo);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No race/class info found\
      \ for this skill.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on DB2 files being properly loaded and parsed by the TrinityCore
    system. Ensure that the DB2Manager is initialized before calling this function.
    The returned integer value may represent an index or ID within internal lookup
    tables used for skill validation.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid skill ID may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect return values. Always validate the input skill ID against known valid
    skill ranges before invoking this method.
