  signature: void BotPriorityManager::LoadDefaultConfiguration()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes default bot priority configurations for the BotPriorityManager.
  description: The LoadDefaultConfiguration method sets up the initial priority rules
    and configurations used by the BotPriorityManager to determine how AI bots should
    prioritize their actions within the World of Warcraft environment. This method
    typically loads predefined settings that define which activities (such as quest
    completion, combat engagement, or resource gathering) take precedence over others
    for bot behavior. It is usually called during system initialization or when resetting
    bot configurations to default values. The method does not accept any parameters
    and does not return a value, making it a pure configuration loader.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPriorityManager priorityManager;

      priorityManager.LoadDefaultConfiguration();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked once during the startup of the TrinityCore
    server or when a new bot instance is initialized. It may overwrite any existing
    custom configurations, so it should be used carefully in environments where custom
    settings are required.
  warnings: Calling this method will reset all current priority configurations to
    their default values, potentially overriding any custom settings previously applied.
    Ensure that this is the intended behavior before execution.
