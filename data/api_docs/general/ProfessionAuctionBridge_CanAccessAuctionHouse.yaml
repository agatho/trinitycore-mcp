  signature: bool ProfessionAuctionBridge::CanAccessAuctionHouse(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can access the auction house based on their profession
    and game state
  description: The CanAccessAuctionHouse method checks if a given player has the necessary
    prerequisites to interact with the auction house system. This includes verifying
    that the player has the required professions, is in a valid game state, and meets
    any additional conditions such as level requirements or faction restrictions.
    The method typically performs checks related to the player's profession skill
    levels, whether they have access to specific auction house areas, and if their
    character meets general eligibility criteria for using auction services. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining game balance and ensuring that only appropriate
    players can utilize auction house features.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      or internal player reference. This parameter is used to retrieve player-specific
      data including profession information, level, and other eligibility factors
      required for auction house access.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all conditions required to access the
    auction house, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate missing professions,
    insufficient skill levels, character state issues, or other restrictions that
    prevent auction house usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nbool canAccess = bridge->CanAccessAuctionHouse(&playerId);\n\
      if (canAccess) {\n    // Proceed with auction house interaction\n    printf(\"\
      Player can access auction house\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle restricted access\n\
      \    printf(\"Player cannot access auction house\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player State Validation
    code: "int* playerPtr = &playerId;\nif (bridge->CanAccessAuctionHouse(playerPtr))\
      \ {\n    // Validate additional conditions before allowing access\n    if (player->GetLevel()\
      \ >= 10 && player->HasEnoughMoney()) {\n        // Allow full auction house\
      \ access\n        AuctionHouseMgr::SendAuctionHello(session, player);\n    }\n\
      } else {\n    // Send error message to player\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not have permission to access the auction house.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs multiple checks internally including profession
    validation, level requirements, and possibly faction or reputation status. The
    parameter 'player' is expected to be a valid reference that can be dereferenced
    to obtain player data. Performance-wise, this check should be lightweight as it's
    typically called frequently during auction house interactions.
  warnings: The method signature uses an integer pointer instead of a direct player
    object reference which may indicate internal implementation details or compatibility
    with older APIs. Ensure that the pointed-to integer represents a valid player
    identifier before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
