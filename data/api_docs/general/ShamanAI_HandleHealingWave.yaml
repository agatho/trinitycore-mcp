  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandleHealingWave
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleHealingWave(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Performs the healing wave spell cast for a target unit.
  description: The HandleHealingWave method is responsible for executing the Shaman's
    Healing Wave ability. This method selects an appropriate target, validates the
    casting conditions, and initiates the healing spell. It typically operates within
    the context of a Shaman's AI behavior, determining when and how to use this healing
    spell based on the current combat situation and target health status. The method
    returns true if the spell was successfully cast or queued, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's ID or index.
      This parameter is used to identify which unit should receive the healing wave
      effect.
  returns: Returns true if the Healing Wave spell was successfully initiated or queued
    for casting, false if the spell could not be cast due to invalid targets, insufficient
    mana, or other conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleHealingWave
    code: "int targetId = 42;\nbool result = shamanAI->HandleHealingWave(&targetId);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Healing wave was cast successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Shaman AI logic and should only be called when
    the AI has determined that healing is necessary. The target parameter may be modified
    by the method to reflect a different unit if the original target is invalid or
    out of range.
  warnings: Ensure that the target ID passed in is valid and represents an alive unit,
    otherwise the method may fail silently or cause unexpected behavior. Also note
    that this method does not handle mana costs directly; it assumes sufficient resources
    are available.
