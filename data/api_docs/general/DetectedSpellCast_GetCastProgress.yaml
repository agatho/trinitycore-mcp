  class: DetectedSpellCast
  method: GetCastProgress
  signature: float DetectedSpellCast::GetCastProgress() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current cast progress of a detected spell as a float value between
    0.0 and 1.0.
  description: The GetCastProgress method retrieves the completion percentage of a
    spell cast that has been detected by the AI system. This value represents how
    far along the spell casting process is, with 0.0 indicating the cast has just
    started and 1.0 indicating the cast is complete. The returned float value is typically
    used for determining when to trigger actions based on spell cast progress, such
    as interrupting a spell or preparing for its effects. This method is commonly
    used in AI scripts for detecting and reacting to enemy spell casts in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the cast progress, where
    0.0 indicates the spell has just begun casting and 1.0 indicates the spell has
    completed casting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spell progress
    code: "float progress = detectedSpellCast->GetCastProgress();\nif (progress >=\
      \ 0.75f)\n{\n    // Spell is 75% complete, take action\n    DoSomething();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using cast progress to determine interrupt timing
    code: "float progress = detectedSpellCast->GetCastProgress();\nif (progress >\
      \ 0.5f && progress < 0.8f)\n{\n    // Interrupt the spell during its mid-cast\
      \ phase\n    InterruptSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid DetectedSpellCast objects that
    have been properly initialized with a spell cast. The returned value is updated
    in real-time as the spell progresses, making it suitable for dynamic AI behavior
    adjustments. The method does not perform any validation checks on its own and
    assumes the object state is consistent.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or destroyed DetectedSpellCast
    object may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the object is valid before
    calling this method. Additionally, since this returns a floating-point value,
    be aware of potential precision issues when comparing values directly.
