documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotLifecycle instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotLifecycle class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the lifetime of a bot lifecycle object.
    This includes cleaning up internal data structures, terminating any active threads
    or processes, and ensuring proper shutdown of bot-related subsystems. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI framework, this method ensures that when a bot is removed
    or destroyed, all associated state information is properly cleared to prevent
    memory leaks or dangling references.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotLifecycle object
    code: 'BotLifecycle* bot = new BotLifecycle();

      // ... perform bot operations ...

      delete bot; // Triggers ~BotLifecycle() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a BotLifecycle object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that all references
    to the bot are cleared before deletion to avoid accessing freed memory.
