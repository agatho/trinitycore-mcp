  class: MovementValidator
  method: EnableStuckDetection
  signature: void MovementValidator::EnableStuckDetection(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the stuck detection mechanism for movement validation.
  description: The EnableStuckDetection method controls whether the MovementValidator
    will monitor for players or units becoming stuck during movement. When enabled,
    the validator tracks movement progress over time and can trigger alerts or corrective
    actions if movement appears to be stalled. This is particularly useful in preventing
    players from getting stuck in terrain or objects. The method does not perform
    any immediate validation but sets an internal flag that affects subsequent movement
    checks. It's typically called during initialization or configuration phases of
    the movement system.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      stuck detection. When true, movement validation will monitor for stuck conditions;
      when false, this check is skipped.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable stuck detection for a player
    code: 'MovementValidator validator;

      validator.EnableStuckDetection(true);

      // Now the validator will monitor for stuck movements'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable stuck detection in specific scenarios
    code: "if (player->HasAura(SPELL_ID_STUN))\n{\n    validator.EnableStuckDetection(false);\n\
      \    // Disable stuck detection during stun effect\n}\nelse\n{\n    validator.EnableStuckDetection(true);\n\
      \    // Re-enable stuck detection when not stunned\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state that affects movement validation behavior.
    It's recommended to call this before starting active movement monitoring. The
    implementation likely uses time-based thresholds and distance tracking to determine
    if movement has stalled.
  warnings: Disabling stuck detection may cause players to become permanently stuck
    in certain scenarios without automatic recovery. Ensure proper testing when toggling
    this setting during gameplay.
