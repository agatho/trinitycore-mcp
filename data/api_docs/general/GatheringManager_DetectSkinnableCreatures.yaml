  method: DetectSkinnableCreatures
  signature: int GatheringManager::DetectSkinnableCreatures(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Detects and returns the number of skinnable creatures within a specified
    range.
  description: The DetectSkinnableCreatures method scans the area around the player
    or object for creatures that can be skinned. It evaluates each creature in the
    given range to determine if it meets the criteria for skinning, such as being
    a valid skinnable mob type and not being dead or already skinned. The method returns
    an integer count of how many such creatures were found. This functionality is
    commonly used in gathering mechanics, particularly for professions like Leatherworking
    where skinning is required. The range parameter defines the maximum distance from
    the calling object to search for skinnable creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of skinnable creatures detected within
    the specified range. Returns 0 if no skinnable creatures are found or if the range
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int skinnableCount = gatheringManager.DetectSkinnableCreatures(10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for Skinnable Creatures in Player's Vicinity
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfloat range = 25.0f;\nint count = player->GetGatheringManager()->DetectSkinnableCreatures(range);\n\
      if (count > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with skinning action\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Found %d skinnable creatures nearby.\", count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal creature flags and mob types to determine
    if a creature is skinnable. It may also consider the creature's current state
    (alive, dead, etc.) and proximity to the calling object. Performance-wise, this
    method iterates through nearby creatures and performs checks on each one, so large
    ranges or many creatures in the area could impact performance.
  warnings: This method assumes that the calling object has a valid gathering manager
    instance. If used without proper initialization or in an invalid context (e.g.,
    from a non-player object), it may return unexpected results or cause crashes.
    The range parameter should be validated to prevent excessive search areas.
