  class: QuestAcceptanceManager
  method: GetGoldPriority
  signature: float QuestAcceptanceManager::GetGoldPriority(const int * quest) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the gold priority value for a given quest based on
    quest data and player context.
  description: The GetGoldPriority method computes a floating-point value that represents
    how valuable a quest is in terms of gold rewards. This value is typically used
    by the QuestAcceptanceManager to determine which quests should be prioritized
    for acceptance when multiple quests are available. The calculation considers factors
    such as the quest's gold reward amount, quest level, and potentially other contextual
    data like player level or quest reputation rewards. The method takes a pointer
    to an integer representing the quest ID and returns a float that indicates the
    relative priority of that quest for gold-based decision making.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest ID. This parameter must
      point to a valid quest identifier in the game's database, otherwise behavior
      is undefined.
  returns: A float value representing the gold priority of the specified quest. Higher
    values indicate higher gold reward priority. The exact scale and calculation method
    depend on internal logic but typically reflects the relative value of the gold
    reward compared to other quests.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int questId = 12345;

      float priority = questManager->GetGoldPriority(&questId);

      printf("Quest %d has gold priority: %.2f\n", questId, priority);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Quest Selection Logic
    code: "int bestQuestId = 0;\nfloat highestPriority = -1.0f;\nfor (auto& quest\
      \ : availableQuests)\n{\n    float priority = questManager->GetGoldPriority(&quest);\n\
      \    if (priority > highestPriority)\n    {\n        highestPriority = priority;\n\
      \        bestQuestId = quest;\n    }\n}\nprintf(\"Best quest by gold priority:\
      \ %d\\n\", bestQuestId);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger quest acceptance algorithm that considers
    multiple factors beyond just gold rewards. The returned value may be influenced
    by player level, quest type, and other game mechanics. The method should not be
    called with null pointers to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure the quest ID pointed to by the parameter is valid and corresponds
    to an existing quest in the database. Using invalid quest IDs may lead to incorrect
    calculations or crashes. This method might not be thread-safe if used concurrently
    across multiple threads without proper synchronization.
