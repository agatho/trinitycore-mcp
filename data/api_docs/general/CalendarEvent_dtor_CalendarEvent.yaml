  method: ~CalendarEvent
  signature: void CalendarEvent::~CalendarEvent()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CalendarEvent object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The ~CalendarEvent destructor is automatically invoked when a CalendarEvent
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, internal data structures, and associated
    resources related to the calendar event. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this destructor plays a crucial role in managing event
    lifecycle within the game's calendar system, preventing memory leaks and ensuring
    that event-related data is properly disposed of when no longer needed. The destruction
    process typically involves releasing references to other objects, clearing internal
    caches, and performing any necessary cleanup operations before the object instance
    is fully removed from memory.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void CreateAndDestroyEvent()\n{\n    CalendarEvent event;\n    // Event\
      \ is automatically destroyed when it goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'CalendarEvent* event = new CalendarEvent();

      // ... use the event ...

      del event; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to understand that this destructor may be called
    during server shutdown or when events are removed from memory, so any cleanup
    performed must be safe and not rely on external systems that might already be
    shutting down.
  warnings: Developers should avoid calling this destructor directly as it can lead
    to undefined behavior. Also, ensure that no other objects hold references to the
    CalendarEvent being destroyed, as this could cause dangling pointers or access
    violations during cleanup.
