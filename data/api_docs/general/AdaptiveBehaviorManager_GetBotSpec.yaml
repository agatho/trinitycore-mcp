  method: GetBotSpec
  signature: uint32 AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetBotSpec() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the specialization identifier associated with the adaptive behavior
    manager.
  description: The GetBotSpec method returns a unique identifier representing the
    bot's current specialization or role within the adaptive behavior system. This
    value is typically used to determine which set of behaviors, actions, or strategies
    should be applied to the bot. The returned value corresponds to a predefined specialization
    index that maps to specific AI decision-making logic. This method is commonly
    called during bot initialization or when evaluating behavior changes based on
    in-game conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the bot's current specialization ID. This ID
    typically maps to a defined set of behaviors, roles, or class specializations
    within the TrinityCore AI framework. The value is usually non-zero and corresponds
    to an entry in the bot specialization database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 specId = bot->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager()->GetBotSpec();\nif (specId\
      \ == 1)\n{\n    // Bot is using the healer specialization\n    bot->SetAIState(BOT_AI_STATE_HEALING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Behavior Switching Based on Spec
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = bot->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();\n\
      uint32 currentSpec = behaviorMgr->GetBotSpec();\nswitch (currentSpec)\n{\n \
      \   case BOT_SPEC_TANK:\n        // Apply tank-specific behaviors\n        break;\n\
      \    case BOT_SPEC_DAMAGE:\n        // Apply damage dealer behaviors\n     \
      \   break;\n    case BOT_SPEC_HEAL:\n        // Apply healer behaviors\n   \
      \     break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with bot specialization configuration
    files or database entries. The returned value should be validated against known
    specialization IDs to ensure proper behavior handling. This method does not perform
    any internal state changes; it simply retrieves the current specialization setting.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned specialization ID is within valid range before
    using it for behavior selection, as invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or
    crashes in AI logic. The method assumes that the AdaptiveBehaviorManager has been
    properly initialized and configured.
