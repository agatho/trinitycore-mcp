  signature: std::string ReputationMgr::GetReputationRankName(const FactionEntry *
    factionEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the localized reputation rank name for a given faction entry.
  description: The GetReputationRankName method retrieves the localized string representation
    of the reputation rank associated with a specific faction. This method is used
    to display the current standing of a player towards a particular faction in a
    human-readable format. The returned string corresponds to the localized name of
    the reputation level (e.g., 'Hated', 'Neutral', 'Revered') based on the player's
    current reputation value with that faction. It internally uses the faction's reputation
    rank thresholds and localization tables to determine the appropriate label.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the localized reputation rank name for the specified
    faction, such as 'Hated', 'Neutral', 'Revered', etc., or an empty string if the
    faction entry is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Get Reputation Rank Name for a Faction
    code: 'FactionEntry const* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1118); // Example
      faction ID

      std::string rankName = player->GetReputationMgr().GetReputationRankName(faction);

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("misc", "Player''s reputation rank with faction %u is: %s", faction->ID,
      rankName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal reputation system and localization tables.
    It assumes that the faction entry passed to it is valid and properly initialized
    within the game's data structures. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input parameter beyond checking for null.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid FactionEntry pointer may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always ensure that the faction entry exists in the game's database
    before calling this method.
