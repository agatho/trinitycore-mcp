documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum health value for a creature based on its level.
  description: This method retrieves the base maximum health of a creature based on
    its current level. The returned value represents the health that a creature would
    have at full health when spawned, which is determined by the creature's level
    and its base health values. This method is commonly used in game mechanics to
    calculate creature health for various purposes including combat calculations,
    AI behavior, and health regeneration. It typically returns a uint64 value that
    corresponds to the creature's maximum health at the specified level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the maximum health value as a uint64 for the creature at the given
    level. This value represents the base health of the creature and can be used to
    calculate health percentages or determine health regeneration rates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 maxHealth = creature->GetMaxHealthByLevel(10);

      // Returns maximum health for level 10 creature'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature health-related
    methods to determine the full health of a creature. It may be affected by creature's
    level scaling and other factors that influence health calculation. Performance
    considerations include avoiding repeated calls for the same level.
  warnings: This method should not be called during combat or when creature is already
    in combat as it may cause inconsistent results. The returned value is based on
    base health and does not account for any modifiers or buffs that might affect
    actual health.
