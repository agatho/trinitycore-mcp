  class: EmpowermentController
  method: GetSpellId
  signature: int EmpowermentController::GetSpellId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell identifier associated with the empowerment effect.
  description: The GetSpellId method returns the unique integer identifier (spell
    ID) of the spell currently being managed by the EmpowermentController. This identifier
    corresponds to a specific spell entry in the game's spell database and is used
    to determine which empowerment effect is active. The method provides read-only
    access to the internal spell ID stored within the controller instance, allowing
    other systems to query the current empowerment state without modifying it. This
    functionality is typically utilized in gameplay mechanics involving empowered
    abilities, such as those found in certain class specializations or enchantments.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the spell identifier (spell ID) of the empowerment
    effect currently managed by this controller instance. Returns zero if no valid
    spell ID has been set or if the controller is uninitialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "EmpowermentController* controller = player->GetEmpowermentController();\n\
      int spellId = controller->GetSpellId();\nif (spellId > 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ the empowerment spell\n    sLog->outString(\"Active empowerment spell ID:\
      \ %d\", spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spell Application Logic
    code: "void ApplyEmpowerment(Player* player, uint32 spellId)\n{\n    EmpowermentController*\
      \ controller = player->GetEmpowermentController();\n    if (controller && controller->GetSpellId()\
      \ == 0)\n    {\n        // Only apply if no empowerment is currently active\n\
      \        controller->SetSpellId(spellId);\n        player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ spellId, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple getter operation and does not involve any database
    lookups or complex computations. It is safe to call from any thread context where
    the EmpowermentController instance is accessible. The returned spell ID should
    be validated against the game's spell database before use in spell casting operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the EmpowermentController instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method. Calling GetSpellId on a null or uninitialized controller
    may result in undefined behavior. Additionally, the returned spell ID might not
    correspond to an active spell if it has been set but not yet applied or if it
    was set incorrectly.
