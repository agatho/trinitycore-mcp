documentation:
  brief: Removes a complaint ticket from the database.
  description: The DeleteFromDB method removes the current complaint ticket record
    from the database. This method is typically called when a ticket has been resolved
    or no longer needs to be tracked in the system. The operation directly affects
    the underlying database entry and should only be invoked after ensuring that all
    necessary data has been processed or transferred elsewhere. It does not perform
    any validation on the ticket's state before deletion.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete a complaint ticket
    code: "ComplaintTicket* ticket = sComplaintsMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\n\
      if (ticket)\n{\n    ticket->DeleteFromDB();\n    // Ticket is now removed from\
      \ database\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct database delete operation and should be used
    carefully. Ensure that no references to the ticket exist in memory after calling
    this method, as it may lead to dangling pointers or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling DeleteFromDB on a ticket that is still referenced elsewhere in
    the codebase can cause crashes or data corruption. Always verify that the ticket
    object is no longer needed before deletion.
