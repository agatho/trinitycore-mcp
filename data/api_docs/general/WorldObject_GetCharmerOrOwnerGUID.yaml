documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the charmer or owner of this WorldObject.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the creature
    or player that owns or controls the current WorldObject. It is commonly used in
    the context of pet AI and summoning mechanics, where a creature might be controlled
    by a player or another creature. The method returns the GUID of the charmer or
    owner, which can be either a player or a creature, depending on the ownership
    relationship.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the ObjectGuid of the charmer or owner. If no charmer or owner
    exists, it returns an invalid GUID (0).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "ObjectGuid ownerGUID = this->GetCharmerOrOwnerGUID();\nif (!ownerGUID.IsEmpty())\
      \ {\n    // Use the GUID to identify the owner\n    std::cout << \"Owner GUID:\
      \ \" << ownerGUID << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in pet AI logic and summoning systems. It may
    return an invalid GUID if no charmer or owner exists, which can happen in cases
    where the object is not controlled by any entity.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return an invalid GUID if
    the object has no owner or charmer. Always check for validity before using the
    returned GUID.
