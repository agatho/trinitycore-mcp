  class: ShadowDoTTracker
  method: ApplyShadowWordPain
  signature: void ShadowDoTTracker::ApplyShadowWordPain(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: 'Applies the Shadow Word: Pain DoT effect to a target with specified duration.'
  description: 'The ApplyShadowWordPain method is responsible for applying the Shadow
    Word: Pain spell effect as a damage-over-time (DoT) debuff to a target unit. This
    method manages the application of the DoT by setting up the necessary tracking
    information, including the target''s GUID and the duration of the effect. The
    implementation likely involves updating internal state tracking structures within
    the ShadowDoTTracker class to monitor the DoT''s progression and ensure proper
    cleanup when the effect expires or is removed. This method is typically invoked
    during spell casting or aura application logic in the TrinityCore server.'
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: 'The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to apply the Shadow
      Word: Pain DoT effect to. This value must be a valid GameObjectGuid or UnitGuid
      representing an existing unit in the world.'
  - name: duration
    description: 'The duration in milliseconds for which the Shadow Word: Pain DoT
      effect will remain active on the target. This determines how long the damage-over-time
      effect will persist before expiring.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: 'Basic Application of Shadow Word: Pain'
    code: "ShadowDoTTracker tracker;\nUnit* target = player->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n\
      {\n    tracker.ApplyShadowWordPain(target->GetGUID().GetCounter(), 18000);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the core aura system and DoT tracking mechanisms
    in TrinityCore. It may internally call methods to register the DoT effect with
    the target's aura application system, set up periodic damage events, and manage
    cleanup when the DoT expires or is dispelled.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided corresponds to a valid unit that exists
    in the world before calling this method. Passing an invalid or non-existent GUID
    could lead to undefined behavior or crashes within the core server logic.
