documentation:
  brief: Compares two CharacterRestriction objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this CharacterRestriction
    object and another CharacterRestriction object to determine if they are not equal.
    It typically compares all relevant fields or properties of the two objects to
    check for differences. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server
    implementation, this operator is used to evaluate whether two character restriction
    configurations differ in their settings, which may affect player access, abilities,
    or gameplay restrictions. This comparison is essential for determining when restriction
    changes have occurred and need to be applied or communicated to clients.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The CharacterRestriction object to compare against this instance.
      This parameter represents the right-hand side operand in the inequality comparison.
  returns: Returns true if the two CharacterRestriction objects are not equal, meaning
    at least one of their properties differs. Returns false if all properties of both
    objects are identical.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: 'CharacterRestriction restrict1;

      CharacterRestriction restrict2;

      // Assume restrict1 and restrict2 have different values

      bool areDifferent = (restrict1 != restrict2); // Returns true if they differ'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "CharacterRestriction currentRestrictions;\nCharacterRestriction newRestrictions;\n\
      \nif (currentRestrictions != newRestrictions) {\n    // Apply new restrictions\
      \ to the character\n    ApplyNewRestrictions(newRestrictions);\n    // Update\
      \ stored restrictions\n    currentRestrictions = newRestrictions;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is likely implemented using a field-by-field comparison of
    all relevant properties within the CharacterRestriction class. The implementation
    should be efficient and avoid unnecessary computations. It's commonly used in
    game logic where restriction changes need to be detected and handled appropriately.
