  class: InteractionManager
  method: DiscoverFlightPath
  signature: bool InteractionManager::DiscoverFlightPath(Player * bot, Creature *
    flightMaster)
documentation:
  brief: Discovers a flight path for the specified player from the given flight master
    creature.
  description: The DiscoverFlightPath method is used to enable a player character
    to learn and unlock a specific flight path within the game world. This functionality
    is typically invoked when a player interacts with a flight master NPC, allowing
    them to access previously unknown flight routes. The method checks if the player
    has the necessary prerequisites to discover the flight path, such as completing
    required quests or reaching certain reputation levels. It updates the player's
    flight path data in their character database and may trigger visual or auditory
    feedback to indicate successful discovery.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who will
      discover the flight path.
  - name: flightMaster
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the flight master NPC
      from which the flight path is being discovered.
  returns: Returns true if the flight path was successfully discovered and added to
    the player's known paths; otherwise returns false if the discovery failed due
    to prerequisites not being met or other issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flight Path Discovery
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nCreature* flightMaster = ...;\nbool result = sInteractionManager->DiscoverFlightPath(player,\
      \ flightMaster);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Flight path successfully discovered\n\
      \    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Flight path discovered!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Flight Path Discovery with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nCreature* flightMaster = ...;\nif (!player || !flightMaster)\n\
      {\n    return false;\n}\n\nbool discovered = sInteractionManager->DiscoverFlightPath(player,\
      \ flightMaster);\nif (discovered)\n{\n    // Update UI or send notification\n\
      \    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"New flight path unlocked!\");\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Log error or notify user\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to\
      \ discover flight path for player %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's quest and flight path data
    stored in the database. It may also trigger updates to the player's known flight
    paths list, which is used by the game client to display available flight destinations.
    The implementation might include checks for faction restrictions or specific quest
    completion status before allowing discovery.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and flightMaster parameters are valid pointers
    before calling this method to prevent crashes. The method may silently fail if
    prerequisites are not met, so it's important to verify the return value. Be cautious
    when using this in automated scripts as it could potentially be exploited for
    quest skipping or other unintended behaviors.
