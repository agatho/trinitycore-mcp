  class: AuctionHouse
  method: GetGlobalAuctionMetrics
  signature: AuctionMetrics AuctionHouse::GetGlobalAuctionMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves global auction house metrics including item counts, bid statistics,
    and revenue data.
  description: The GetGlobalAuctionMetrics method returns a comprehensive set of statistical
    data about all auctions currently active within the auction house system. This
    includes information such as total number of items listed, number of bids placed,
    average bid amounts, and total revenue generated from completed auctions. The
    returned AuctionMetrics object aggregates data across all factions and servers
    to provide a holistic view of auction house activity. This method is typically
    used for administrative monitoring, game balance analysis, and reporting purposes.
    The data is collected in real-time and reflects the current state of the auction
    house system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AuctionMetrics object containing aggregated statistics about global
    auction house activity, including total items listed, bid counts, revenue figures,
    and other relevant metrics that represent the overall health and activity level
    of the auction system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Auction Metrics
    code: "AuctionMetrics metrics = sAuctionHouse->GetGlobalAuctionMetrics();\nTC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      auction\", \"Total auctions: %u, Total bids: %u, Revenue: %u gold\",\n    metrics.totalAuctions,\n\
      \    metrics.totalBids,\n    metrics.totalRevenue / 10000);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full scan of the auction house database to collect
    statistics, which may have performance implications during peak server activity.
    The returned data is not cached and reflects real-time values. For high-frequency
    monitoring, consider caching results with appropriate refresh intervals.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently can cause performance degradation due to
    database queries. It should not be called in tight loops or high-frequency update
    scenarios. The AuctionMetrics structure may contain large values that could overflow
    if not properly handled when converting to smaller data types.
