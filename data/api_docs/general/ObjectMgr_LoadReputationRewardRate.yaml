  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadReputationRewardRate()
documentation:
  brief: Loads reputation reward rates from the database into memory for use during
    gameplay.
  description: The LoadReputationRewardRate method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with reputation reward multipliers stored in the database. This
    method is typically called during server startup or reload operations to ensure
    that faction-based reputation rewards are properly configured. It reads data from
    the 'reputation_reward_rate' table which defines how much reputation a player
    gains for various factions, allowing for balance adjustments without requiring
    code changes. The loaded rates are used by the game engine when processing reputation
    gain events such as quest completions or creature kills.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code\
      \ ...\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadReputationRewardRate();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with server startup ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading configuration data. It's not thread-safe and must be executed in a single-threaded
    context. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries in internal data structures, potentially causing incorrect reputation
    calculations. Do not invoke this during active gameplay sessions as it could disrupt
    existing reputation states.
