  class: LFGQueue
  method: RemoveFromCompatibles
  signature: void LFGQueue::RemoveFromCompatibles(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player GUID from the LFG queue's compatible players list.
  description: The RemoveFromCompatibles method removes a specified player's GUID
    from the internal compatible players list within the LFG (Looking for Group) queue
    system. This operation is typically used when a player is no longer considered
    a valid match for a group or when they leave the queue. The method ensures that
    the player will not be suggested as a potential group member in future matchmaking
    operations. It operates on the assumption that the GUID corresponds to an existing
    player in the LFG system, and failure to validate this may lead to undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from the
      compatible players list. This should be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Player from Compatible List
    code: 'LFGQueue queue;

      uint64 playerGuid = 123456789ULL;

      queue.RemoveFromCompatibles(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG queue management system and should
    only be called when necessary to maintain accurate matchmaking data. It does not
    perform any validation on the GUID itself, so callers must ensure that the GUID
    refers to a valid player in the system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or corruption of internal data structures. Ensure proper synchronization
    if called from multiple threads.
