  method: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::CombatBehaviorIntegration(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat behavior integration for a player bot
  description: The CombatBehaviorIntegration constructor initializes the combat behavior
    system for a specified player bot. This method sets up the necessary data structures
    and configurations required for the bot to engage in combat scenarios within the
    TrinityCore environment. It establishes the foundation for the bot's combat decision-making
    processes, including target selection, spell casting, and movement behaviors.
    The method ensures that all combat-related subsystems are properly initialized
    before the bot enters combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will have
      combat behavior integrated. Must be a valid player instance with proper initialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Behavior Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get or create bot

      CombatBehaviorIntegration combatBehavior(myBot);

      // Bot is now ready for combat scenarios'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void AddBotToCombat(Player* bot) {\n \
      \       CombatBehaviorIntegration integration(bot);\n        // Additional combat\
      \ setup logic\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may cause undefined behavior or memory leaks. The method assumes
    that the Player object is already properly initialized and registered with the
    server.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure the Player object is valid and fully constructed before calling this constructor.
