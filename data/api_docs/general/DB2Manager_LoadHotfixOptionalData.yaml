  class: DB2Manager
  method: LoadHotfixOptionalData
  signature: void DB2Manager::LoadHotfixOptionalData(uint32 localeMask)
documentation:
  brief: Loads optional hotfix data for the specified locale mask into the database
    manager.
  description: The LoadHotfixOptionalData method initializes and loads additional
    data records that are conditionally applied based on the provided locale mask.
    This functionality is essential for handling localized content updates in World
    of Warcraft, particularly when certain game elements need to be modified or overridden
    for specific regions or client versions. The method typically operates during
    server startup or hotfix application phases, ensuring that optional data sets
    are correctly integrated into the DB2Manager's internal data structures without
    affecting core game mechanics. It is designed to work with TrinityCore's hotfix
    system and may involve reading from database tables or external files containing
    localized overrides.
  parameters:
  - name: localeMask
    description: A bitmask representing the locales for which optional hotfix data
      should be loaded. Each bit corresponds to a specific locale, allowing selective
      loading of localized content.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Load hotfix data for all locales
    code: DB2Manager::Instance()->LoadHotfixOptionalData(LOCALE_all);
    language: cpp
  - title: Load hotfix data for English and French locales only
    code: DB2Manager::Instance()->LoadHotfixOptionalData(LOCALE_en | LOCALE_fr);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server initialization or when applying
    hotfixes to ensure that localized data overrides are properly loaded. The locale
    mask parameter allows for fine-grained control over which optional data sets are
    processed, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary data loading.
  warnings: Improper use of the localeMask parameter may result in missing or incorrect
    localized content. Ensure that the bitmask values correspond to valid locales
    defined in TrinityCore's localization system.
