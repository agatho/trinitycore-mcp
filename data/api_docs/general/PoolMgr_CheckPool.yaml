  signature: bool PoolMgr::CheckPool(uint32 pool_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified pool exists within the pool manager system.
  description: The CheckPool method verifies whether a pool with the given ID is registered
    in the PoolMgr. This functionality is essential for validating pool references
    before attempting to access or manipulate pool data. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, pools are used to manage groups of game objects, creatures, or game
    events that are spawned together. The method performs a lookup in the internal
    pool registry and returns true if the pool exists, false otherwise. This check
    is commonly used prior to pool operations to prevent invalid access attempts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a pool with the specified ID exists in the manager; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pool Existence Check
    code: "if (sPoolMgr->CheckPool(12345)) {\n    // Pool with ID 12345 exists\n \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Pool 12345 is registered.\");\n} else {\n    // Pool with\
      \ ID 12345 does not exist\n    sLog->outString(\"Pool 12345 is not registered.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple lookup operation in the pool registry. It is
    lightweight and suitable for frequent checks. The method is typically used during
    initialization or validation phases to ensure pool integrity before operations
    are performed.
