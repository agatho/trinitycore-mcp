  method: CallScriptCheckCastHandlers
  signature: SpellCastResult Spell::CallScriptCheckCastHandlers()
documentation:
  brief: Executes all registered script handlers to check if a spell can be cast.
  description: The CallScriptCheckCastHandlers method invokes all script-based check-cast
    handlers that have been registered for the current spell. These handlers are typically
    used by custom scripts or mods to override or extend the default spell casting
    validation logic. The method evaluates each handler's result and returns the most
    restrictive outcome, ensuring that if any script prevents the spell from being
    cast, it will be blocked accordingly. This method is part of the spell's pre-cast
    validation process and is called before the actual spell execution begins.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SpellCastResult enum value indicating the result of all check-cast
    handler evaluations. Possible values include SPELL_CAST_OK if all handlers pass,
    or various error codes such as SPELL_FAILED_REAGENTS, SPELL_FAILED_CUSTOM_ERROR,
    etc., depending on which script handler(s) failed the validation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell cast validation
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell->CallScriptCheckCastHandlers();\nif (result\
      \ != SPELL_CAST_OK)\n{\n    // Handle the failure case\n    SendCastResult(result);\n\
      \    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during the spell casting process
    and should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom spell validation
    logic. The order in which script handlers are executed is determined by their
    registration sequence, and early returns from failing handlers may prevent subsequent
    checks from executing.
  warnings: Modifying or bypassing this method's behavior can lead to unexpected spell
    casting behavior or exploits. Ensure that any custom handlers return appropriate
    SpellCastResult values to maintain game balance and integrity.
