documentation:
  brief: Checks if a creature snapshot is valid for target scanning purposes
  description: The IsValidTargetSnapshot method evaluates whether a given creature
    snapshot from the spatial grid is considered a valid target for AI scanning operations.
    This validation typically includes checking if the creature is within acceptable
    distance thresholds, not in an invalid state (such as being dead or despawned),
    and meets other criteria required for target consideration. The method is part
    of the TargetScanner class which handles target selection logic for AI systems
    in TrinityCore. It ensures that only appropriate creatures are considered when
    determining valid targets for various AI behaviors such as threat generation,
    targeting, or combat decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: A const reference to a DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::CreatureSnapshot
      object containing the creature's current spatial and state data. This snapshot
      includes position, health status, faction, and other relevant attributes needed
      for target validation.
  returns: Returns true if the creature snapshot passes all validation checks and
    is considered a valid target; false otherwise. The method returns false when the
    creature is dead, out of range, invisible, or otherwise not suitable for targeting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI target selection
    code: "if (targetScanner.IsValidTargetSnapshot(creatureSnapshot)) {\n    // Process\
      \ valid target\n    target = creatureSnapshot;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision making loop
    code: "for (const auto& snapshot : spatialGrid.GetCreatureSnapshots()) {\n   \
      \ if (targetScanner.IsValidTargetSnapshot(snapshot)) {\n        // Add to potential\
      \ targets list\n        validTargets.push_back(snapshot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the context of spatial grid traversal
    and AI target scanning. The implementation likely involves checking multiple conditions
    including creature state, distance from scanner, visibility, and faction relationships.
    Performance is important as this method may be called frequently during AI processing
    cycles.
  warnings: Do not use this method to validate creatures that are not part of the
    spatial grid's current snapshot data. The method assumes the snapshot contains
    valid, up-to-date information about the creature's state and position.
