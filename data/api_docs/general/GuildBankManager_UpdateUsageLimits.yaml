  class: GuildBankManager
  method: UpdateUsageLimits
  signature: void GuildBankManager::UpdateUsageLimits(int * player, BankOperation
    operation, uint32 tabId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the usage limits for guild bank operations based on player activity
    and bank operation type.
  description: The UpdateUsageLimits method in GuildBankManager is responsible for
    tracking and updating the usage limits of guild bank tabs and items. It takes
    into account the player's actions, the type of bank operation being performed
    (such as deposit or withdraw), and the specific tab ID involved. This method ensures
    that guild bank operations adhere to configured limits and restrictions, preventing
    abuse and maintaining game balance. The method likely updates internal counters
    or flags within the guild bank system to reflect recent usage patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      in the guild bank system. This parameter tracks which player is performing the
      operation.
  - name: operation
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of bank operation being performed
      (e.g., deposit, withdraw). This determines how usage limits should be updated
      or checked.
  - name: tabId
    description: Identifier for the specific guild bank tab that the operation is
      targeting. Used to apply limit updates to the correct tab context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildBankManager* bankManager = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildBankManager();

      int playerId = 12345;

      BankOperation op = BANK_OP_DEPOSIT;

      uint32 tabId = 0;

      bankManager->UpdateUsageLimits(&playerId, op, tabId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild bank state tracking and
    may be called automatically during bank operations. It's important to ensure that
    the player pointer is valid and that operation types are properly defined within
    the game's bank system.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the player pointer or invalid operation types could
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect limit updates in the guild bank system.
