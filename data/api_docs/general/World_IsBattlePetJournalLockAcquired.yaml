  method: IsBattlePetJournalLockAcquired
  signature: bool World::IsBattlePetJournalLockAcquired(int battlenetAccountGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Battle Pet Journal is locked for a specific Battle.net
    account.
  description: The IsBattlePetJournalLockAcquired method checks if the Battle Pet
    Journal has been locked for a given Battle.net account GUID. This functionality
    is typically used in World of Warcraft to prevent certain actions or interactions
    while the journal is in a locked state, such as during specific quest events or
    when a player is in a restricted game phase. The lock status may be set by game
    systems, GM commands, or other internal mechanisms. The method returns true if
    the journal is currently locked for the specified account, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: battlenetAccountGuid
    description: The unique Battle.net account identifier (GUID) of the player whose
      Battle Pet Journal lock status is being checked. This value must be a valid
      GUID representing a Battle.net account within the game's database.
  returns: Returns true if the Battle Pet Journal is locked for the specified Battle.net
    account, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that no modifications
    or interactions with the journal are allowed at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player's Battle Pet Journal is locked
    code: "uint64 accountId = player->GetSession()->GetBattlenetAccountGuid();\nbool\
      \ isLocked = sWorld->IsBattlePetJournalLockAcquired(accountId);\nif (isLocked)\n\
      {\n    // Prevent further actions with the journal\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Battle Pet Journal is currently locked.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal game state tracking and may be
    used in conjunction with other Battle Pet Journal related systems. It's important
    to note that the lock status could change dynamically during gameplay, so repeated
    calls might return different results.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided battlenetAccountGuid is valid before calling
    this method, as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or database errors.
    Also, be aware that locking mechanisms can be context-sensitive and may not apply
    uniformly across all game modes or scenarios.
