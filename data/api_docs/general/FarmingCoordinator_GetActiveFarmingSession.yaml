  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: GetActiveFarmingSession
  signature: const FarmingSession * FarmingCoordinator::GetActiveFarmingSession(uint32
    playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the active farming session associated with a specified player GUID.
  description: The GetActiveFarmingSession method retrieves a pointer to the currently
    active FarmingSession for a given player identified by their unique identifier
    (GUID). This method is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's
    farming mechanics, where players engage in activities such as tending to crops
    or managing resources. The returned session may be null if no active farming activity
    exists for the specified player. It is important to note that this method does
    not modify any state; it only retrieves existing data. This function is thread-safe
    and can be called from multiple threads concurrently without risk of data corruption.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose active farming session
      is to be retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: A constant pointer to a FarmingSession object if an active session exists
    for the specified player; otherwise, returns nullptr indicating no active farming
    session.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const FarmingSession* session = coordinator->GetActiveFarmingSession(playerGuid);\n\
      if (session != nullptr) {\n    // Process the active farming session\n    session->Update();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where no active session exists\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      farming\", \"No active farming session for player {}\", playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Session Validity Before Use
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nconst FarmingSession* activeSession = coordinator->GetActiveFarmingSession(playerId);\n\
      if (activeSession && activeSession->IsInProgress()) {\n    // Proceed with farming\
      \ logic\n    activeSession->ProcessGrowth();\n} else {\n    LOG_INFO(\"farming\"\
      , \"Player {} has no valid active farming session.\", playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FarmingCoordinator maintains an internal mapping
    or registry of player GUIDs to their respective active FarmingSession objects.
    The returned pointer should not be modified directly, as it points to managed
    data within the coordinator. Performance-wise, this lookup is expected to be O(1)
    assuming proper indexing.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value implies the session is valid
    for immediate use. Always verify the session's state before performing operations
    on it. Also, since this method returns a const pointer, attempting to modify the
    session through it will result in compile-time errors.
