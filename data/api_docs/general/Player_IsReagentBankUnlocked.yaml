documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's reagent bank is unlocked and accessible.
  description: This method checks if the player has unlocked their reagent bank, which
    is a separate storage space used for storing reagents required for spell crafting.
    The reagent bank is typically locked by default and can only be accessed after
    certain quest progression or achievement unlocks. This method returns true when
    the reagent bank is available for use, false otherwise. It is commonly used in
    conjunction with other player-related methods to determine inventory access and
    game progression status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the reagent bank is unlocked and accessible, false otherwise.
    The method does not return null or error values as it is a simple boolean check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsReagentBankUnlocked()) {\n    // Player can access reagent\
      \ bank\n    // Perform actions like storing/retrieving reagents\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory-related
    methods to determine player's access to special storage areas. Implementation
    may depend on game mechanics related to quest progression and achievement unlocks.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct indicator of whether the player
    can store reagents, as it only indicates unlock status. The actual ability to
    store reagents depends on other factors like inventory capacity and item restrictions.
