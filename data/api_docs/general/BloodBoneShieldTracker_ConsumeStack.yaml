documentation:
  brief: Reduces the stack count of the blood bone shield by one, potentially removing
    the effect if the stack reaches zero.
  description: The ConsumeStack method is responsible for decrementing the current
    stack count of a blood bone shield effect. This method is typically invoked when
    the shield is consumed or used in some manner, such as during damage absorption
    or activation. When the stack count reaches zero, the shield effect is removed
    from the target. The method does not return any value and operates directly on
    the internal state of the BloodBoneShieldTracker instance. It is commonly used
    in conjunction with other shield mechanics to manage the duration and effectiveness
    of the blood bone shield buff.

    code: 'BloodBoneShieldTracker* tracker = player->GetAura(12345)->GetEffect(0)->GetAura()->GetHolder();

      tracker->ConsumeStack();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the shield has already been validated to exist and
    is active. It directly modifies internal stack counters without performing additional
    checks for validity or state transitions.
