  class: StoredLootContainer
  method: StoredLootContainer
  signature: void StoredLootContainer::StoredLootContainer(uint64 containerId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a StoredLootContainer instance with the specified container identifier.
  description: The StoredLootContainer constructor initializes a loot container object
    using a provided unique identifier. This class is typically used within the TrinityCore
    framework to manage loot data associated with game objects such as chests, corpses,
    or quest rewards. The containerId parameter identifies the specific loot container
    in the game world, allowing the system to retrieve and manipulate its contents.
    This constructor likely sets up internal tracking mechanisms for the container's
    state and ensures proper linkage to the underlying database or memory structures
    that store loot information.
  parameters:
  - name: containerId
    description: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier (GUID)
      of the loot container in the game world. This ID is used to associate the container
      with its stored loot data and track its state during gameplay.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new StoredLootContainer instance
    code: 'uint64 chestGuid = 123456789ULL;

      StoredLootContainer lootContainer(chestGuid);

      // Initializes a loot container for a chest with GUID 123456789'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when loading or creating loot containers from database entries. Developers should
    ensure that the provided containerId corresponds to an actual existing container
    in the game world to avoid runtime errors or undefined behavior.
