  method: GetTemporaryPetReactState
  signature: int Player::GetTemporaryPetReactState() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current temporary pet react state of the player.
  description: This method retrieves the temporary pet react state value that determines
    how a player's summoned pet behaves in combat. The value represents the pet's
    reaction state to threats, which can be either passive, defensive, or aggressive.
    This state is typically set during specific game events or player actions and
    affects how the pet responds to enemy targets. The method is commonly used in
    conjunction with pet behavior management and combat mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the temporary pet react state. Possible
    values include 0 (passive), 1 (defensive), or 2 (aggressive). A value of 0 indicates
    the pet will not attack enemies unless explicitly commanded, while 1 and 2 indicate
    the pet will engage in combat based on its current state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int reactState = player->GetTemporaryPetReactState();\nif (reactState ==\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Pet is passive\n}\nelse if (reactState == 1)\n{\n    // Pet\
      \ is defensive\n}\nelse if (reactState == 2)\n{\n    // Pet is aggressive\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with pet behavior management
    and combat mechanics. The returned value can be modified by various game events,
    player actions, or spell effects that influence pet behavior. This method does
    not directly affect the pet's actual state but rather returns the current temporary
    state.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return different
    values based on game events or player actions. The value returned may change during
    combat or when a pet is summoned, so developers should ensure proper handling
    of state changes.
