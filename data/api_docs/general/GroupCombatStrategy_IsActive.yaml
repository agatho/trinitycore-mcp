documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group combat strategy is currently active for the
    specified bot AI instance.
  description: The IsActive method checks if the GroupCombatStrategy is currently
    enabled and actively managing combat behavior for a given BotAI instance. This
    method evaluates internal state flags and conditions to determine if the strategy
    should be applied during combat scenarios. The result influences whether the bot
    will engage in group-based combat tactics, such as maintaining formation, coordinating
    attacks, or following specific combat protocols. This check is typically performed
    during AI decision-making cycles to ensure appropriate behavior based on current
    group dynamics and combat situation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GroupCombatStrategy is currently active and managing
    combat behavior for the specified bot AI; returns false otherwise. The method
    may return false if the strategy has been disabled, the bot is not in a group,
    or combat conditions do not meet activation criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check strategy status
    code: "if (groupCombatStrategy.IsActive(ai)) {\n    // Strategy is active, proceed\
      \ with group combat logic\n    ai->DoGroupCombat();\n} else {\n    // Strategy\
      \ is not active, use alternative behavior\n    ai->DoSoloCombat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration within AI decision loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (groupCombatStrategy.IsActive(this)) {\n\
      \        // Execute group combat behavior\n        HandleGroupCombat();\n  \
      \  } else {\n        // Fall back to individual combat behavior\n        HandleSoloCombat();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight state check and should not have significant
    performance impact. It is designed to be called frequently during AI update cycles.
    The activation status may change dynamically based on group composition, combat
    state, or player-defined settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI parameter passed to this method is valid and initialized
    before calling. Calling IsActive with a null pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. This method should not be used as a substitute for checking
    actual combat state, as it only reflects strategy activation status.
