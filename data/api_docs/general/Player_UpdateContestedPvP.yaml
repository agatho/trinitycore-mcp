documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's contested PvP state based on current time and PvP activity.
  description: The UpdateContestedPvP method manages the contested PvP status of a
    player by checking and updating their PvP flag state, timer, and related flags.
    This method is typically called during player updates to ensure that players who
    have recently engaged in PvP activities maintain proper contested PvP status until
    the timer expires. It handles the transition from contested PvP to regular PvP
    or non-PvP states based on time elapsed and activity. The method ensures that
    players cannot immediately re-enter contested PvP after leaving it, preventing
    abuse of the PvP system.

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Update Loop
    code: "void Player::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    UpdateContestedPvP(getMSTime());\n\
      \    // ... other update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the player's regular update cycle.
    It relies on internal PvP timers and state management. The method does not directly
    modify game objects or send packets; it updates internal flags that may be used
    by other systems to determine PvP status.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you understand the PvP state system.
    Incorrect usage can lead to inconsistent PvP states, potential exploits, or incorrect
    flag display to players.
