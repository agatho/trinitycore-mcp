  class: GuildBankManager
  method: DetermineItemCategory
  signature: GuildBankItemType GuildBankManager::DetermineItemCategory(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the category type of a guild bank item based on its item ID.
  description: The DetermineItemCategory method analyzes the provided item ID to classify
    it into a specific guild bank item category. This classification is used internally
    by the GuildBankManager to determine how items should be handled within the guild
    bank system, such as which tabs they can be stored in or what restrictions apply
    to them. The method performs lookups against internal item databases and game
    rules to assign each item to one of several predefined categories that govern
    guild bank behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a GuildBankItemType enum value indicating the category of the specified
    item. Possible values include common categories like EQUIPMENT, CONSUMABLE, QUEST_ITEM,
    REAGENT, and others depending on the game's item classification system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 itemId = 12345;\nGuildBankItemType category = guildBankManager->DetermineItemCategory(itemId);\n\
      if (category == GUILD_BANK_ITEM_EQUIPMENT)\n{\n    // Handle equipment item\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups or cached data access to determine
    the category. It may be called frequently during guild bank operations, so performance
    optimization is important. The method assumes valid item IDs are passed and does
    not perform input validation.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or uninitialized item IDs as it may
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect categorization. Ensure that item IDs correspond
    to actual items in the game's database before calling.
