  brief: Determines whether the player can use TitanGrip ability.
  description: This method checks if the player character is eligible to use the TitanGrip
    ability, which is a special combat move that allows players to grab enemies and
    pull them closer. The method evaluates various conditions including player level,
    class restrictions, and cooldown status to determine eligibility. It's commonly
    used in combat scenarios where players need to assess their ability usage before
    executing actions.

    whether the player meets all prerequisites for using the ability.
