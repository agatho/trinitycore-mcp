  class: Unit
  method: SetAI
  signature: void Unit::SetAI(UnitAI * newAI)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the AI behavior for a Unit to control its AI state and execution.
  description: The SetAI method allows developers to assign a specific UnitAI instance
    to a Unit, enabling custom AI behavior and control over how the unit interacts
    with the game world. This method is crucial for implementing custom AI logic in
    NPCs or creatures, allowing developers to define how units respond to various
    events, conditions, or triggers within the game environment. The method typically
    requires an AI instance that implements the UnitAI interface, ensuring proper
    functionality and behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: newAI
    description: A pointer to a UnitAI instance that defines the AI behavior for the
      unit. This parameter must be a valid pointer to an AI implementation; passing
      nullptr will disable the AI.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Assignment Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit("target");

      UnitAI* customAI = new CustomAI();

      target->SetAI(customAI);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced AI Assignment with Null Check
    code: "Unit* npc = GetUnit(\"npc\");\nif (npc != nullptr)\n{\n    UnitAI* ai =\
      \ new GenericAI();\n    npc->SetAI(ai);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used during initialization or when changing AI states.
    It should be called carefully to avoid memory leaks or invalid pointer usage.
    The AI instance must remain valid for the duration of the unit's existence.
  warnings: Calling SetAI with a null pointer can cause undefined behavior and may
    lead to crashes if the unit attempts to execute AI logic. Always ensure that the
    AI instance is properly initialized before calling this method.
