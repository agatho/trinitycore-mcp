documentation:
  brief: Sends a time synchronization packet to the client
  description: The SendTimeSync method transmits a time synchronization message to
    the connected client, ensuring that the client's local time remains synchronized
    with the server's time. This is crucial for maintaining accurate game timing,
    especially for events, cooldowns, and other time-sensitive mechanics in World
    of Warcraft. The method typically sends a packet containing the current server
    timestamp to help the client adjust its internal clock. No parameters are required
    as the method uses the session's current context to determine what data to send.

  - title: Basic usage in game logic
    code: "void SomeGameEvent::Handle()\n{\n    // Trigger time sync when player enters\
      \ a specific zone\n    if (player->GetSession())\n    {\n        player->GetSession()->SendTimeSync();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the server during certain
    events or when explicit time synchronization is required. It's important to note
    that frequent calls may impact network performance, so it should be used judiciously.
    The actual packet format and timing behavior are handled internally by the TrinityCore
    networking layer.
