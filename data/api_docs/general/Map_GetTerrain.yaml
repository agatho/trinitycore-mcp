  method: GetTerrain
  signature: TerrainInfo * Map::GetTerrain() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the terrain information for the current map.
  description: The GetTerrain method retrieves the terrain information associated
    with the current Map object. This method provides access to terrain data including
    height maps, zone information, and other geographical details relevant to the
    map's structure. The returned TerrainInfo pointer contains data about the map's
    terrain characteristics, which is essential for navigation, collision detection,
    and world interaction in TrinityCore. This method is typically used during map
    loading or when processing player movement and positioning within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to a TerrainInfo structure that contains detailed terrain
    information for the current map. The pointer may be null if no terrain data is
    available or if the map has not been initialized properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "TerrainInfo* terrain = map->GetTerrain();\nif (terrain)\n{\n    // Use\
      \ terrain information\n    std::cout << \"Terrain height: \" << terrain->Height\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    TerrainInfo pointer should not be modified directly as it represents immutable
    data about the map's terrain structure. Performance considerations include caching
    the terrain information to avoid repeated calls.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the map might not
    have been fully initialized or loaded, as it could return null values. Also note
    that terrain data may be incomplete or inaccurate if the map is still loading.
