api:
  class: Group
  method: SetEveryoneIsAssistant
  signature: void Group::SetEveryoneIsAssistant(bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether all group members are granted assistant permissions.
  description: The SetEveryoneIsAssistant method enables or disables the assistant
    role for all members of the group. When enabled, every player in the group will
    have assistant privileges, which typically allows them to perform certain group-related
    actions such as loot distribution and group leadership duties. This method modifies
    the internal state of the group and affects how permissions are handled for all
    current and future group members. The change takes effect immediately for existing
    members but may require synchronization with the client-side UI updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable assistant permissions for all group members
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetEveryoneIsAssistant(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable assistant permissions for all group members
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetEveryoneIsAssistant(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the calling player has sufficient permissions
    to modify group settings. It directly modifies the internal flag that controls
    assistant status for all members. Changes made using this function are typically
    propagated to clients automatically by the TrinityCore server logic.
  warnings: Using this method without proper permission checks may lead to unexpected
    behavior or privilege escalation. Ensure that only authorized players (such as
    group leaders) can invoke this method to prevent abuse of group management features.
