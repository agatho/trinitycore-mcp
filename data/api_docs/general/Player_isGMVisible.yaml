documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently visible to other players in GM
    mode.
  description: The isGMVisible method checks if a player is currently in Game Master
    (GM) visibility mode, meaning they are not hidden from other players. This method
    is commonly used in TrinityCore to determine if a player's GM status is active
    and they are visible to others. The method returns true when the player is visible
    to other players, and false when they are hidden or invisible. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining proper game balance and ensuring that GMs can interact
    with players without being hidden from them. The method does not require any parameters
    and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is visible to other players, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player's GM visibility status is active or not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->isGMVisible()) {\n    // Player is visible to other players\n\
      \    // Do something here\n}\nelse {\n    // Player is not visible to other\
      \ players\n    // Do something else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GM-related functions
    to manage player visibility. It's important to note that the method only checks
    for visibility status, not whether the player is actually a GM or not. The implementation
    relies on internal game state tracking and may be affected by various game mechanics
    such as invisibility effects or GM mode settings.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player is a GM, as it
    only checks visibility status. Be aware that the method may return false even
    when a player is in GM mode but has been hidden by other players or game effects.
