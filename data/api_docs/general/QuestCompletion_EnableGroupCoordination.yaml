  class: QuestCompletion
  method: EnableGroupCoordination
  signature: void QuestCompletion::EnableGroupCoordination(uint32 botGuid, bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables group coordination for a specified bot during quest completion.
  description: The EnableGroupCoordination method controls whether a specific bot
    (identified by its GUID) should coordinate with the player's group during quest
    completion events. When enabled, the bot will synchronize its actions with the
    group, ensuring that quest objectives are completed in a coordinated manner. This
    is particularly useful for bots participating in group quests or scenarios where
    multiple players or NPCs need to act in unison. The method does not validate whether
    the bot is actually part of a group; it simply sets the internal flag for coordination
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which group coordination
      is being enabled or disabled.
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      group coordination for the specified bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Group Coordination for a Bot
    code: 'QuestCompletion questComp;

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      questComp.EnableGroupCoordination(botGuid, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Group Coordination for a Bot
    code: 'QuestCompletion questComp;

      uint32 botGuid = 67890;

      questComp.EnableGroupCoordination(botGuid, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags related to group coordination and
    does not directly interact with the game world or player objects. It is intended
    for use in AI-driven quest completion logic where bots must behave according to
    group dynamics.
