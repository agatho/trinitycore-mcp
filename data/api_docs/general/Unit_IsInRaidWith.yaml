  signature: bool Unit::IsInRaidWith(const Unit * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is in the same raid group as another unit.
  description: The IsInRaidWith method checks if the calling unit shares the same
    raid group with a specified unit. This function is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to determine group membership for various game mechanics,
    including raid composition, player interaction, and quest progression. It returns
    true if both units are members of the same raid party, false otherwise. The method
    considers both raid and party group membership, making it useful for determining
    whether units are in the same group regardless of their specific group type.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is in the same raid group as the specified unit,
    false otherwise. This indicates that both units belong to the same raid or party
    group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsInRaidWith(targetUnit)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsInRaidWith(targetUnit) && targetUnit->GetGUID() == player->GetGUID())\
      \ {\n    // Perform actions for same raid group\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other group-related functions
    to determine whether units are part of the same raid or party. It does not consider
    individual player character status, only group membership. Performance-wise, this
    function is lightweight and suitable for frequent use during gameplay.
  warnings: This method may return false if the unit is not in a raid group but is
    in a party group, or vice versa. Care should be taken when using this method in
    conjunction with other group-related functions to ensure accurate results.
