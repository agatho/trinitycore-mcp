documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the area of effect zone is currently active and functional.
  description: The IsActive method checks if an Area of Effect (AOE) zone is currently
    active within the game world. This typically involves verifying that the zone
    has not expired, is not disabled, and meets any other activation criteria defined
    by its implementation. The method is commonly used in spell or ability systems
    to determine if a triggered AOE effect should be applied or if the zone is still
    valid for interaction. It may also consider time-based activation states, player
    proximity, or other game mechanics relevant to AOE zones.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AOE zone is currently active and functional; otherwise
    returns false if the zone has expired, is disabled, or otherwise inactive.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (aoeZone->IsActive(GetMSTime())) {\n    // Apply AOE damage or effects\n\
      \    aoeZone->ApplyEffects();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Zone State Before Player Interaction
    code: "void Player::HandleAOEInteraction(AOEZone* zone) {\n    if (zone && zone->IsActive(getMSTime()))\
      \ {\n        // Process player interaction with active zone\n        zone->ProcessPlayerEntry(this);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Zone is inactive, notify player\n        SendSystemMessage(\"\
      This area is no longer active.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses a timestamp-based system to determine activity state.
    It's important to note that the current time parameter may be used for expiration
    checks or cooldown management. This method is probably called frequently during
    game updates, so performance considerations should be taken into account when
    implementing custom AOE zone logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the currentTime parameter passed to this method reflects a
    valid and consistent time source (e.g., GetMSTime() or similar) to avoid incorrect
    activation states. Incorrect handling of time values may lead to zones appearing
    active when they should be inactive, or vice versa.
