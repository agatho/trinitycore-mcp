  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModSkill(const AuraApplication * aurApp, uint8
    mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the skill level of a unit affected by an aura.
  description: The HandleAuraModSkill method is responsible for applying or removing
    skill modifications to a unit based on an aura effect. This method is typically
    invoked during aura application or removal events, adjusting the target's skill
    levels according to the aura's properties. It handles both positive and negative
    skill modifications, which can affect various skills such as weapon skills, spellcraft,
    or other specialized abilities within the game. The method ensures that skill
    changes are properly propagated to the affected unit's skill system and any related
    subsystems.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura application
      context. This parameter contains information about which unit is affected, the
      aura type, and other relevant application data.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation for the aura effect. This value determines
      how the skill modification should be applied or removed, typically indicating
      whether it's an additive or multiplicative change.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the aura effect. When true, the skill modification is added to the unit; when
      false, it is removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Skill Modifier Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* auraEffect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      uint8 mode = 1;

      bool apply = true;


      auraEffect->HandleAuraModSkill(app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Skill Modifier Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* auraEffect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      uint8 mode = 2;

      bool apply = false;


      auraEffect->HandleAuraModSkill(app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the unit's skill system and should only
    be called during appropriate aura application/removal events. The mode parameter
    may have specific predefined values that control how the skill modification is
    calculated and applied.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect skill levels being displayed
    or calculated for players and NPCs. Ensure that the aura application context is
    valid before calling this method.
