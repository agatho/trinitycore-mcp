documentation:
  brief: Resets all movement metrics to their default values.
  description: The Reset method clears and reinitializes all internal counters and
    measurements within the MovementMetrics class. This method is typically invoked
    when a new movement session begins or when existing data needs to be cleared to
    prevent carryover effects between different movement contexts. It ensures that
    subsequent measurements start from a clean state, which is essential for accurate
    tracking of player or creature movement behavior in the game world.

  - title: Resetting Movement Metrics at Session Start
    code: 'MovementMetrics metrics;

      // ... perform some movement operations ...

      metrics.Reset(); // Clear all previous measurements'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting a new measurement cycle to ensure
    accurate data collection. The reset operation is atomic and does not require external
    synchronization.
