documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current spell hit was a critical strike
  description: The IsHitCrit method checks if the spell's current hit resulted in
    a critical strike. This method is typically used within SpellScript implementations
    to modify behavior based on whether a spell critically hit its target. In World
    of Warcraft's combat system, a critical strike deals increased damage or effect
    compared to a normal hit. The method returns true if the spell hit was a critical
    strike, and false otherwise. This check is performed during the spell's execution
    phase, after all calculations but before final effects are applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current spell hit was a critical strike; otherwise
    returns false
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in SpellScript
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleHit()\n\
      \    {\n        if (IsHitCrit())\n        {\n            // Apply additional\
      \ effects for critical hits\n            GetCaster()->AddAura(12345, GetHitUnit());\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional damage modification based on crit status
    code: "class DamageSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void ModifyDamage()\n\
      \    {\n        if (IsHitCrit())\n        {\n            // Double the damage\
      \ for critical hits\n            int32 damage = GetHitDamage();\n          \
      \  SetHitDamage(damage * 2);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during spell execution phases where hit
    calculations have been completed. It's commonly used in SpellScript hooks like
    HandleHit or ModifySpellDamage to adjust effects based on critical strike status.
    The result is determined by the game's internal critical strike calculation system
    which considers attacker stats, target resistance, and spell properties.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of appropriate SpellScript execution contexts
    as it may return undefined behavior. The method relies on proper spell hit processing,
    so calling it before hit calculations are complete will yield incorrect results.
