  class: TargetScanner
  method: GetMaxEngageRange
  signature: float TargetScanner::GetMaxEngageRange() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the maximum engagement range for the target scanner.
  description: The GetMaxEngageRange method determines the furthest distance at which
    a target can be engaged by the scanner. This value is typically used in AI behavior
    to decide when to initiate combat or movement actions. The method considers various
    factors such as the scanner's current state, target type, and environmental conditions
    to compute this range. It is commonly invoked during AI decision-making processes
    to ensure appropriate targeting behavior within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum engagement range in yards. This
    value indicates the distance beyond which the scanner will not attempt to engage
    targets. Returns 0.0f if no valid range can be determined or if the scanner is
    in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float maxRange = scanner->GetMaxEngageRange();\nif (maxRange > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with engagement logic\n    std::cout << \"Maximum engage range:\
      \ \" << maxRange << \" yards\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "class EnemyAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Update()\n    {\n        float maxRange\
      \ = scanner->GetMaxEngageRange();\n        if (target && target->GetDistance(scanner)\
      \ <= maxRange)\n        {\n            // Engage the target\n            scanner->EngageTarget(target);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned value may vary based on the scanner's current configuration
    and state. This method is typically called frequently during AI updates, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account. The implementation likely caches
    computed values to avoid redundant calculations.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned range is always positive. Always validate the
    return value before using it in critical game logic. In certain edge cases involving
    invalid targets or scanner states, this method may return 0.0f which could lead
    to unexpected behavior if not properly handled.
