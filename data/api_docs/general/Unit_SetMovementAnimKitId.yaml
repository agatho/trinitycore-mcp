api:
  class: Unit
  method: SetMovementAnimKitId
  signature: void Unit::SetMovementAnimKitId(uint16 animKitId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the movement animation kit ID for the unit, controlling how it moves.
  description: This method assigns a specific animation kit ID to a Unit object, which
    determines the movement animations that will be used when the unit performs actions
    like walking, running, or other movement behaviors. The animation kit ID is typically
    sourced from the database or client-side animation data and affects the visual
    representation of movement in World of Warcraft. This method is commonly used
    during creature AI or player movement scripting to ensure proper animation behavior
    during various game states.
  parameters:
  - name: animKitId
    description: The animation kit ID to assign to the unit. Valid values are typically
      between 0 and 65535, representing different movement animations such as walking,
      running, or idle states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetMovementAnimKitId(1234);

      // This sets the movement animation kit to 1234 for the unit'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetMovementAnimKitId(5678);

      // This sets a custom animation kit ID for movement behavior

      // The animation kit ID should be valid and match the expected range'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class's movement animation system. It should
    be used carefully as it affects visual movement behavior in the game world. The
    animation kit ID must be properly defined in the database or client-side data
    to ensure correct behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause incorrect movement animations or
    visual artifacts in the game world. Care should be taken when setting animation
    kit IDs to ensure they match valid ranges and are consistent with the expected
    behavior.
