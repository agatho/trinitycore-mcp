documentation:
  brief: Updates the evoker's positioning based on current target and spell requirements.
  description: The UpdateEvokerPositioning method is responsible for adjusting an
    evoker's position during combat to ensure optimal casting conditions. It evaluates
    the evoker's current target, spell requirements, and environmental factors to
    determine whether repositioning is necessary. This method typically handles movement
    logic such as maintaining proper distance from enemies, avoiding harmful terrain,
    or positioning for specific spell casts. The AI will adjust the evoker's location
    dynamically during combat based on game mechanics like line of sight, spell range,
    and threat management.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateEvokerPositioning()\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        // Check if repositioning is needed\n        if (NeedToReposition())\n\
      \        {\n            MoveToTarget();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI's update loop and should be
    invoked regularly during combat. It may interact with movement handlers and pathfinding
    systems to ensure smooth positioning transitions.
