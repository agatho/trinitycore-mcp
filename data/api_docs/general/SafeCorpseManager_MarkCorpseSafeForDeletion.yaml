  signature: void SafeCorpseManager::MarkCorpseSafeForDeletion(int corpseGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Marks a corpse as safe for deletion in the SafeCorpseManager.
  description: The MarkCorpseSafeForDeletion method is used to flag a specific corpse
    identified by its GUID as ready for removal from the game world. This method is
    typically invoked when a player's corpse has been successfully processed or is
    no longer needed, such as after the corpse has been looted or after a certain
    time period has elapsed. The SafeCorpseManager uses this marking to determine
    which corpses can be safely removed from memory and the database without affecting
    ongoing gameplay mechanics. This method does not immediately delete the corpse
    but rather prepares it for eventual cleanup by the system.
  parameters:
  - name: corpseGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the corpse to be marked as safe for
      deletion. This value must correspond to an existing corpse in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking a Corpse for Deletion
    code: 'SafeCorpseManager* manager = sObjectAccessor->GetCorpseManager();

      manager->MarkCorpseSafeForDeletion(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SafeCorpseManager's internal cleanup mechanism.
    It is important to ensure that any references to the corpse are properly handled
    before calling this method, as it indicates that the corpse will be removed from
    memory shortly. The actual deletion may not occur immediately but will be processed
    during the next cleanup cycle.
