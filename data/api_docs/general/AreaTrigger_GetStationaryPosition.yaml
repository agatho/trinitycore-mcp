  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetStationaryPosition
  signature: const int & AreaTrigger::GetStationaryPosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the stationary position index of the area trigger.
  description: The GetStationaryPosition method retrieves the stationary position
    identifier associated with an AreaTrigger object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, area triggers are used to define spatial regions that can activate
    events or effects when players enter them. The stationary position typically refers
    to a predefined location within the trigger's definition, often used for positioning
    effects or determining where an event should occur relative to the trigger's geometry.
    This method is commonly used in conjunction with area trigger scripts and event
    handling systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the stationary position
    index of the area trigger. This index typically corresponds to a specific location
    within the trigger's defined area, which may be used for positioning visual effects,
    determining spawn points, or managing trigger behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume this is a valid AreaTrigger pointer

      const int& positionIndex = trigger->GetStationaryPosition();

      // Use positionIndex to determine where the area trigger''s effect should be
      positioned'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Event Handling
    code: "void HandleAreaTriggerEnter(Player* player, AreaTrigger* trigger)\n{\n\
      \    const int& stationaryPos = trigger->GetStationaryPosition();\n    // Use\
      \ the stationary position to determine effect placement\n    if (stationaryPos\
      \ == 0)\n    {\n        // Apply effect at default position\n        player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_ID_DEFAULT_EFFECT, true);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Apply\
      \ effect at custom position based on index\n        player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_ID_CUSTOM_EFFECT, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal member variable of the AreaTrigger
    class. Modifying this value directly through the returned reference may affect
    the trigger's behavior. This method is thread-safe as long as no concurrent modifications
    are made to the underlying data structure.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying the returned value, as it represents a core
    property of the area trigger. Changes might impact how the trigger behaves in
    the game world. Ensure that any modifications maintain consistency with the expected
    range of valid stationary position values for the specific trigger type.
