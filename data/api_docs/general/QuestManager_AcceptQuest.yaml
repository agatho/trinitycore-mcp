  method: AcceptQuest
  signature: bool QuestManager::AcceptQuest(uint32 questId, WorldObject * questGiver)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the process of accepting a quest from a quest giver object.
  description: The AcceptQuest method handles the logic required to accept a quest
    in World of Warcraft using the TrinityCore emulation framework. It validates whether
    the player can accept the specified quest, updates the player's quest log, and
    triggers any associated quest events or objectives. The method requires a valid
    quest identifier and a reference to the quest giver object (such as an NPC or
    item) that offers the quest. This method is typically invoked when a player interacts
    with a quest giver and selects to accept a quest.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be accepted. Must correspond
      to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is offering the quest, such as an
      NPC or item. Must not be null and must be a valid quest giver.
  returns: Returns true if the quest was successfully accepted and added to the player's
    quest log; otherwise returns false if validation fails or the quest cannot be
    accepted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nWorldObject* questGiver = ...;\nuint32 questId =\
      \ 12345;\nif (player->GetQuestManager().AcceptQuest(questId, questGiver)) {\n\
      \    // Quest accepted successfully\n} else {\n    // Failed to accept quest\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Acceptance with Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nWorldObject* questGiver = ...;\nuint32 questId =\
      \ 12345;\nif (player->GetQuestManager().AcceptQuest(questId, questGiver)) {\n\
      \    // Quest accepted\n    player->SendNotification(\"Quest accepted: [Quest\
      \ Name]\");\n} else {\n    // Quest failed to be accepted\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Failed to accept quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal validation checks such as quest prerequisites,
    level requirements, and previous quest completion status. It is recommended to
    ensure that the quest giver object is valid and within interaction range before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid quest ID or quest giver may lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player has sufficient permissions
    and that the quest is not already in the player's log.
