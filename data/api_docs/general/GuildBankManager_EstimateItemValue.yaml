  class: GuildBankManager
  method: EstimateItemValue
  signature: uint32 GuildBankManager::EstimateItemValue(uint32 itemId, uint32 stackCount)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the estimated value of a specified item in the guild bank based
    on its ID and stack count.
  description: The EstimateItemValue method computes the monetary value of a given
    item within the context of a guild bank system. It takes into account both the
    item's unique identifier (itemId) and the quantity of that item (stackCount) to
    determine an estimated worth. This functionality is typically used for inventory
    management, financial tracking, or auction house integration within the guild
    banking framework. The method likely accesses internal databases or item templates
    to derive this value, making it essential for maintaining accurate guild finances
    and item valuation records.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to estimate. This corresponds to
      the item's entry in the game's database and must reference a valid item template.
  - name: stackCount
    description: The number of items in the stack for which the value is being estimated.
      Must be a positive integer representing the quantity of the specified item.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the estimated monetary worth of the
    specified item(s) in the guild bank context. The value may be zero if the item
    has no market value or is not recognized by the system.
  examples:
  - title: Estimate Value of a Single Item
    code: uint32 itemValue = guildBankManager->EstimateItemValue(12345, 1); // Estimates
      value of one item with ID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Estimate Value of a Stack of Items
    code: uint32 totalValue = guildBankManager->EstimateItemValue(67890, 50); // Estimates
      value of 50 items with ID 67890
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using cached item data or database lookups
    to ensure performance. It may not account for temporary enchantments or item modifications
    that could affect real-world value. The returned value should be treated as an
    estimate and might differ from actual market prices in the game economy.
  warnings: Ensure that itemId corresponds to a valid item in the game's database;
    invalid IDs may result in incorrect estimations or errors. Be cautious when using
    this method in performance-critical sections of code due to potential database
    access overhead.
