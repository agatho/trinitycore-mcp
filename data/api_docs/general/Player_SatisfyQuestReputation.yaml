  signature: bool Player::SatisfyQuestReputation(const Quest * qInfo, bool msg) const
documentation:
  brief: Satisfies quest reputation requirements for the player.
  description: This method checks if the player has met the reputation requirements
    needed to complete a specific quest. It evaluates whether the player's current
    reputation levels with the relevant factions are sufficient to satisfy the quest's
    requirements. The method returns true if the player meets all required reputation
    conditions, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for quest completion
    mechanics in World of Warcraft, particularly when dealing with quests that require
    specific faction reputation levels.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing reputation requirements that
      need to be satisfied
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to display quest completion messages
      to the player
  returns: Returns true if the player's reputation levels satisfy all required conditions
    for the quest, false otherwise. If the method returns false, it means the player
    lacks sufficient reputation to complete the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->SatisfyQuestReputation(quest, true))\n{\n    // Player can\
      \ complete the quest\n    // Perform quest completion actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with reputation checking
    code: "const Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nif (player->SatisfyQuestReputation(quest,\
      \ false))\n{\n    // Player has sufficient reputation but no message is shown\n\
      \    // Continue with quest completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally checks faction reputation levels against the quest's
    requirements. It uses the player's current reputation values and compares them
    to the required reputation thresholds specified in the quest data. This method
    is typically used during quest completion validation and may be called multiple
    times during a single quest completion process.
  warnings: This method should not be used for checking reputation levels outside
    of quest completion context, as it may cause unexpected behavior if used incorrectly.
    The method does not account for reputation gains from other sources like quest
    rewards or item drops - only checks against current player reputation levels.
