  signature: void FlameShockTracker::FlameShockTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FlameShockTracker class.
  description: The FlameShockTracker constructor initializes the tracking mechanism
    for Flame Shock effects in World of Warcraft. This class is typically used to
    monitor and manage the application, duration, and stacking behavior of Flame Shock
    on targets. It handles internal state management for tracking which players have
    Flame Shock applied, their remaining duration, and any associated damage calculations.
    The constructor sets up default values and initializes necessary data structures
    for tracking flame shock effects across the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new FlameShockTracker instance
    code: 'FlameShockTracker tracker;

      // This creates a new tracker object ready to monitor Flame Shock effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the game engine when managing
    spell effects. Developers should not need to instantiate this class directly unless
    implementing custom spell tracking logic. The class likely integrates with TrinityCore's
    aura system and spell handling mechanisms.
