  class: Cell
  method: NoCreate
  signature: bool Cell::NoCreate() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the cell is marked as not requiring creation.
  description: The NoCreate method determines if a Cell object has been flagged to
    skip the creation process during world loading or chunk initialization. This flag
    is typically used in TrinityCore's grid-based world system to optimize memory
    usage and processing time by avoiding unnecessary object instantiation for certain
    grid cells that are known to be empty or inactive. The method returns true if
    the cell should not be created, and false otherwise. This functionality is particularly
    relevant in large-scale world environments where performance optimization is crucial.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the cell is marked as not requiring creation (i.e., it
    should be skipped during initialization), or false if the cell should be processed
    normally and created as part of the world grid system.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a Cell should be Created
    code: "Cell cell;\n// Assume cell has been initialized with some grid data\nif\
      \ (cell.NoCreate()) {\n    // Skip creation logic for this cell\n    printf(\"\
      Skipping creation for this cell\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed with normal\
      \ cell creation\n    printf(\"Proceeding with cell creation\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal grid management system. It's
    primarily used during server startup and world loading phases to reduce memory
    allocation overhead by skipping cells that are known to be empty or unused.
