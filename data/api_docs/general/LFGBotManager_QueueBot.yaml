documentation:
  brief: Queues a bot player for a LFG dungeon group
  description: The QueueBot method attempts to add a specified bot player to the Looking
    For Group (LFG) system for a given dungeon. It handles the bot's role assignment
    and dungeon selection, integrating with TrinityCore's LFG framework to facilitate
    automated group finding. The method ensures that the bot is properly registered
    in the LFG queue with the correct role and dungeon parameters. This functionality
    is typically used in automated systems or testing environments where bots need
    to participate in group content without manual intervention.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that should be
      queued for LFG. Must be a valid player instance with proper LFG capabilities
      enabled.
  - name: role
    description: The role the bot should assume in the group (e.g., tank, healer,
      damage dealer). Values typically correspond to LFG role constants defined in
      TrinityCore's LFG system.
  - name: dungeons
    description: Integer representing the dungeon or dungeons the bot is willing to
      queue for. This may be a single dungeon ID or a bitmask of multiple dungeon
      IDs depending on implementation.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully queued for LFG, false otherwise.
    Failure may occur due to invalid parameters, already queued status, or system
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic bot queueing
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player\nbool success = sLFGMgr->QueueBot(myBot,\
      \ LFG_ROLE_TANK, 1234); // Queue for specific dungeon as tank\nif (success)\n\
      \    TC_LOG_INFO(\"lfg\", \"Bot queued successfully\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the LFG system being properly initialized and active.
    The bot must be in a valid state to participate in LFG queues. Performance may
    be affected if many bots are queued simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player object is valid and properly initialized before
    calling this method. Using invalid pointers or incorrect role values can lead
    to undefined behavior or system errors.
