documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a specific action bar entry from the charm's action bar by index.
  description: The GetActionBarEntry method retrieves a const pointer to a UnitActionBarEntry
    object at the specified index within the charm's action bar. This method is used
    to access individual action bar slots, which can contain spells, items, or other
    actions that the charm (such as a pet) can perform. The action bar entries are
    typically managed by the CharmInfo class and represent the available actions for
    the charm in the game interface. The index parameter must be within valid bounds;
    otherwise, the method may return a null pointer or cause undefined behavior. This
    functionality is essential for implementing charm behavior and UI representation
    of pet actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the UnitActionBarEntry at the specified index, or nullptr
    if the index is out of bounds or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing a Charm's Action Bar Entry
    code: "CharmInfo* charmInfo = pet->GetCharmInfo();\nif (charmInfo)\n{\n    const\
      \ UnitActionBarEntry* entry = charmInfo->GetActionBarEntry(0);\n    if (entry\
      \ && entry->GetType() == ACTION_BUTTON_SPELL)\n    {\n        // Process the\
      \ spell action\n        uint32 spellId = entry->GetAction();\n        // Use\
      \ spellId for further logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the charm's action bar has been properly initialized
    and populated. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the CharmInfo object
    remains alive and the action bar data hasn't changed. Accessing entries beyond
    the allocated range may lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned UnitActionBarEntry directly through this method;
    it's a const pointer. Attempting to access invalid indices can result in segmentation
    faults or other runtime errors. Ensure that the CharmInfo object is valid before
    calling this method.
