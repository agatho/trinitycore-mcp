  class: KitingUtils
  method: CalculateOptimalKitingDistance
  signature: float KitingUtils::CalculateOptimalKitingDistance(Player * bot, Unit
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal kiting distance for a bot to maintain while attacking
    a target.
  description: The CalculateOptimalKitingDistance method determines the ideal distance
    a bot should maintain from its target during combat to maximize damage output
    while minimizing incoming threat. This calculation takes into account various
    factors such as the bot's attack range, the target's movement speed, and the bot's
    ability to deal damage at different distances. The method is primarily used in
    AI-driven kiting behaviors where maintaining optimal positioning is crucial for
    survival and efficiency. It assumes both the bot and target are valid units within
    the game world and that combat-related mechanics are properly initialized.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be calculating
      kiting distance. Must not be null and must represent a valid player unit in
      the game world.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target that the bot is
      attacking. Must not be null and must represent a valid unit in the game world.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the optimal kiting distance in yards.
    A negative value may indicate an error or invalid calculation, while zero typically
    means no distance is required (e.g., if the bot can attack the target directly).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CalculateOptimalKitingDistance
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized\nUnit* target = ...; // Assume\
      \ initialized\nfloat optimalDistance = KitingUtils::CalculateOptimalKitingDistance(bot,\
      \ target);\nif (optimalDistance >= 0)\n{\n    // Use the calculated distance\
      \ for positioning logic\n    bot->SetFacingTo(target);\n    bot->MoveTowards(target,\
      \ optimalDistance);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI behaviors to implement
    kiting mechanics. The calculation may vary depending on the bot's class, weapon
    type, and spell capabilities. It's important to note that this function does not
    perform any movement or positioning itself but only calculates the distance needed.
  warnings: Ensure both bot and target parameters are valid and in the same map instance
    before calling this method. Passing null pointers will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. The returned value should be validated before use in movement
    logic to avoid potential issues with invalid distances.
