  class: PlayerbotConfig
  method: GetBool
  signature: bool PlayerbotConfig::GetBool(const std::string & key, bool defaultValue)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a boolean configuration value by key, returning a default if the
    key is not found.
  description: The GetBool method retrieves a boolean configuration value from the
    PlayerbotConfig instance using the specified key. If the key does not exist in
    the configuration, it returns the provided default value. This method is commonly
    used to access player bot settings that control various behaviors and features
    within the TrinityCore environment. The configuration system typically stores
    these values as key-value pairs where keys are strings and values are parsed into
    appropriate types. This method ensures consistent behavior when accessing boolean
    settings across different parts of the player bot AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: The string key used to identify the specific configuration setting.
      This should match the exact key name as defined in the configuration files or
      system.
  - name: defaultValue
    description: The fallback boolean value to return if the specified key is not
      found in the configuration. This ensures the system has a predictable default
      behavior when settings are missing.
  returns: A boolean value representing the configuration setting if the key exists,
    or the provided defaultValue if the key is not found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: bool enableCombat = playerbotConfig.GetBool("PlayerbotAI\EnableCombat",
      true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Bot Behavior Settings
    code: "bool useSmartTargeting = playerbotConfig.GetBool(\"PlayerbotAI\\SmartTargeting\"\
      , false);\nif (useSmartTargeting) {\n    // Enable smart targeting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with configuration files or
    runtime settings that control player bot behavior. The implementation likely involves
    a map or dictionary lookup for efficient access. It's recommended to cache frequently
    accessed configuration values to avoid repeated lookups.
  warnings: Ensure that the key parameter exactly matches the configuration key as
    defined in the system, including case sensitivity. Incorrect keys will return
    the default value without warning, which might mask configuration errors.
