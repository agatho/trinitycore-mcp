  method: GetNumPlayers
  signature: uint32 Channel::GetNumPlayers() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current number of players in the channel.
  description: The GetNumPlayers method retrieves the count of all players currently
    subscribed to the channel. This value is updated dynamically as players join or
    leave the channel. The method provides a simple way to determine channel occupancy
    for moderation, display purposes, or game logic decisions. It does not distinguish
    between different player types (regular members, moderators, etc.) and simply
    counts all connected participants.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of players currently in the
    channel. Returns 0 if no players are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Channel Occupancy
    code: "Channel* channel = sChatHandler->GetChannelByName(\"Trade\");\nuint32 playerCount\
      \ = channel->GetNumPlayers();\nif (playerCount > 0)\n{\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_CHANNEL_ONLINE,\
      \ channel->GetName().c_str(), playerCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Player Count for Channel Management
    code: "void CheckChannelCapacity(Channel* ch)\n{\n    uint32 currentPlayers =\
      \ ch->GetNumPlayers();\n    if (currentPlayers >= MAX_CHANNEL_PLAYERS)\n   \
      \ {\n        // Notify channel that it's full\n        ch->SendChannelNotify(\"\
      Channel is full.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation and should be efficient. It's
    typically used in conjunction with other channel management functions to provide
    real-time information about channel activity.
