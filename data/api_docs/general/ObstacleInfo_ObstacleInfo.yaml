  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ObstacleInfo class with default values.
  description: The ObstacleInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the ObstacleInfo
    class, setting up internal data structures and default state values. This method
    is typically called when creating a new obstacle information object to be used
    in collision detection, pathfinding, or game physics calculations within the TrinityCore
    framework. The constructor ensures that all member variables are properly initialized
    to their default states, preventing undefined behavior when the object is subsequently
    used. It is important to note that this is a constructor and not a regular method,
    so it does not have a return type and is invoked automatically during object creation.

  examples:
  - title: Creating an ObstacleInfo instance
    code: 'ObstacleInfo obstacle;

      // The constructor is automatically called here, initializing the obstacle with
      default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the ObstacleInfo class initialization process
    and should not be called explicitly. It's typically invoked automatically when
    an ObstacleInfo object is instantiated. Developers working with obstacle data
    in TrinityCore should understand that this constructor sets up internal state
    for collision detection systems.
