  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::EndBenchmark(uint32_t botGuid, const std::string
    & benchmarkName)
documentation:
  brief: Ends a performance benchmark for a specific bot and benchmark name
  description: The EndBenchmark method terminates an ongoing performance measurement
    for a specified bot and benchmark name. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with BeginBenchmark to track and record performance metrics during gameplay or
    simulation activities. It likely stores timing data, calculates performance statistics,
    and may trigger notifications or logging events. The method operates on a per-bot,
    per-benchmark basis, ensuring that different bots can run multiple benchmarks
    simultaneously without interference.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the benchmark is
      being ended. This value must correspond to an existing bot in the system.
  - name: benchmarkName
    description: A string identifier for the specific benchmark being ended. This
      name should match a previously started benchmark initiated with BeginBenchmark.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: PerformanceOptimizer::EndBenchmark(12345, "MovementSpeedTest");
    language: cpp
  - title: In Context with BeginBenchmark
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer::BeginBenchmark(12345, "CombatAnalysis");

      // ... perform combat simulation ...

      PerformanceOptimizer::EndBenchmark(12345, "CombatAnalysis");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring system used
    in TrinityCore's AI or bot framework. It may interact with internal timing mechanisms
    and could be used for profiling bot behavior, optimizing AI decisions, or debugging
    performance issues.
  warnings: Ensure that EndBenchmark is called only after a matching BeginBenchmark
    has been invoked; otherwise, the method may fail or produce undefined behavior.
    Also, make sure that the botGuid corresponds to an active bot instance to avoid
    potential crashes or data corruption.
