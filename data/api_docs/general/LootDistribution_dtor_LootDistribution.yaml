documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LootDistribution object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LootDistribution class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the loot
    distribution process. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when a
    LootDistribution instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this would typically occur after loot has
    been distributed to players or when a loot event is finalized. The destructor
    may handle cleanup of internal data structures such as item lists, player references,
    and distribution state information.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of LootDistribution object
    code: "void ProcessLoot() {\n    LootDistribution* lootDist = new LootDistribution();\n\
      \    // ... perform loot distribution ...\n    delete lootDist; // Destructor\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based LootDistribution destruction
    code: "void DistributeLoot() {\n    LootDistribution lootDist;\n    // ... perform\
      \ loot distribution ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when lootDist\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects are
    destroyed. Developers should not manually call destructors unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. In TrinityCore's context, this destruction
    typically occurs during cleanup of loot events or after all players have received
    their loot items.
