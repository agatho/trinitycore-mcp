  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float PositionManager::GetOptimalRange(PositionType type, ThreatRole
    role)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal combat range for a given position type
    and threat role.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance a unit should
    maintain from its target during combat based on the specified PositionType and
    ThreatRole. This value is used by AI systems to make decisions about movement
    and positioning. The method considers factors such as weapon range, spell casting
    requirements, and role-specific positioning strategies. It is typically called
    during threat assessment and pathfinding calculations to ensure units engage enemies
    at optimal distances for their current combat role.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the optimal distance in yards. This
    value indicates how far a unit should position itself from its target for maximum
    effectiveness based on the specified type and role. Returns 0.0f if invalid parameters
    are provided or if no optimal range is defined for the given combination.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float optimalRange = positionManager->GetOptimalRange(PositionType::MELEE,
      ThreatRole::TANK);

      // Returns the optimal melee range for a tank role'
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making
    code: "if (unit->GetDistance(target) > positionManager->GetOptimalRange(PositionType::RANGED,\
      \ ThreatRole::DPS))\n{\n    unit->MoveTowards(target);\n}\nelse\n{\n    unit->StopMoving();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal configuration tables that define optimal ranges
    for different combinations of PositionType and ThreatRole. The values are typically
    pre-calculated based on game balance requirements and class-specific mechanics.
    The method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads simultaneously
    without synchronization issues.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned value represents a fixed distance - it may
    vary based on dynamic factors like target movement or environmental conditions.
    The method will return 0.0f for invalid combinations, so always check the result
    before using it in calculations.
