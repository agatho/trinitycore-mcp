documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of items processed per auction cycle boost setting.
  description: The GetItemPerCycleBoost method retrieves the configuration value that
    determines how many items are processed during each auction cycle boost. This
    setting is typically used by the Auction Bot system to control the rate at which
    items are listed or updated in the auction house. The returned value represents
    a count of items that will be handled in a single processing cycle when the boost
    condition is met. This configuration helps balance performance and auction activity
    within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of items processed per auction cycle
    boost. This value is typically used to control batch processing rates in the Auction
    Bot system.

    code: 'uint32 itemsPerCycle = auctionBotConfig.GetItemPerCycleBoost();

      LOG_INFO("auctionbot", "Items per cycle boost: {}", itemsPerCycle);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AuctionBotConfig class and should be called after
    the configuration has been initialized. The value returned may vary depending
    on server settings or admin configurations.
