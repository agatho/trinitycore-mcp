  class: BotAIDecisionProfile
  method: UpdateOverallMetrics
  signature: void BotAIDecisionProfile::UpdateOverallMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the overall metrics for the bot AI decision profile based on current
    performance data.
  description: The UpdateOverallMetrics method recalculates and refreshes the aggregate
    performance statistics for a bot AI decision profile. This includes updating various
    metric values such as success rates, response times, and decision effectiveness
    based on recent bot behavior and outcomes. The method is typically invoked during
    periodic AI evaluation cycles or after significant changes in bot decision-making
    patterns. It ensures that the AI's decision-making framework remains adaptive
    and responsive to changing game conditions and player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotAIDecisionProfile profile;

      profile.UpdateOverallMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_decisionProfile->UpdateOverallMetrics();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve computationally intensive calculations depending
    on the complexity of the decision profile and the amount of historical data being
    processed. It is recommended to call this method during low-traffic periods or
    in a background thread to avoid performance degradation in the main game loop.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can lead
    to unnecessary CPU overhead. Ensure that metrics updates are synchronized with
    appropriate intervals to maintain optimal AI performance.
