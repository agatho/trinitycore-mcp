documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the account associated with this
    session
  description: The GetAccountGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier
    that represents the player's account within the TrinityCore server environment.
    This GUID is used extensively throughout the game's backend systems for tracking
    player data, managing permissions, and ensuring data integrity across multiple
    characters and realms. The method provides a consistent way to identify accounts
    regardless of which character is currently active or logged in. It is typically
    called during authentication processes, account management operations, or when
    performing actions that require account-level identification rather than character-specific
    information.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the account associated with this
    WorldSession. This value uniquely identifies the player's account across all realms
    and characters within the TrinityCore instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Identify Account
    code: "void HandleAccountInfo(WorldPacket& recvData)\n{\n    uint32 accountId\
      \ = session->GetAccountGUID();\n    sLog->outString(\"Account ID: %u\", accountId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Account GUID for Database Queries
    code: "void LoadPlayerData(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    uint32 accountId = session->GetAccountGUID();\n\
      \    QueryResult result = CharacterDatabase.Query(\"SELECT * FROM characters\
      \ WHERE account = {}\", accountId);\n    if (result)\n    {\n        // Process\
      \ character data\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the session has been properly authenticated and
    that an account is associated with it. The returned GUID value is typically stored
    in the session's internal state after successful login. This method is thread-safe
    as long as the session object itself is not being modified concurrently by multiple
    threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the session is valid and authenticated before calling this
    method, as calling it on an unauthenticated session may return invalid or unexpected
    values. The returned GUID should never be used directly in SQL queries without
    proper sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
