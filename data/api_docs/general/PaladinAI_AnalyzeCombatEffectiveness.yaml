documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the effectiveness of combat abilities and adjusts paladin AI behavior
    accordingly.
  description: The AnalyzeCombatEffectiveness method is responsible for assessing
    the current state of combat and determining how effectively the paladin's abilities
    are being utilized. This method evaluates factors such as threat generation, damage
    output, healing efficiency, and overall tactical positioning to dynamically adjust
    the AI's decision-making process during battles. It plays a crucial role in ensuring
    that the paladin AI adapts its behavior based on real-time combat data, optimizing
    performance for both PvE and PvP scenarios. The method typically runs during each
    AI update cycle and influences subsequent action selection.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void PaladinAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    AnalyzeCombatEffectiveness();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. It relies on internal
    state tracking of combat metrics and may have performance implications if called
    too frequently outside of normal AI cycles.
