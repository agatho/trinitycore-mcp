    & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a dungeon boot process for a group with specified GUIDs and reason
  description: The InitBoot method starts the process of booting (kicking) players
    from a LFG (Looking For Group) dungeon. It takes the group GUID, kick target GUID,
    and vehicle GUID along with a reason string to initiate the boot sequence. This
    method is typically used when a player needs to be removed from a dungeon group,
    such as due to AFK status or rule violations. The method likely triggers a LFG
    boot packet to be sent to all group members and updates internal LFG state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: gguid
    description: The GUID of the group being booted from the dungeon
  - name: kguid
    description: The GUID of the player to be kicked from the group
  - name: vguid
    description: The GUID of the vehicle associated with the group (may be 0 if none)
  - name: reason
    description: A string explaining why the player is being booted from the dungeon
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic boot initialization
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->InitBoot(12345, 67890, 0, "Player AFK too long");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the LFG system's internal boot management and
    may be called from various game events such as player AFK detection or manual
    kick commands. The implementation probably involves sending a boot packet to all
    group members and updating the LFG queue state.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could result in incorrect group state, potential
    client disconnects, or inconsistent LFG queue behavior. Ensure that all GUIDs
    are valid before calling this method.
