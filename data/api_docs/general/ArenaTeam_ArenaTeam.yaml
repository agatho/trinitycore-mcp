  brief: Moves an arena team object to a new location using move semantics.
  description: The ArenaTeam constructor that accepts an rvalue reference to another
    ArenaTeam object performs a move operation, transferring all resources from the
    source object to the current object. This is a standard C++ move constructor implementation
    that efficiently reassigns internal data members and resets the source object's
    state. The method is typically used when arena team objects need to be transferred
    between containers or scopes without unnecessary copying. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft server architecture, this operation supports efficient management
    of arena team data structures during dynamic allocation and reallocation scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing an ArenaTeam
    code: 'ArenaTeam team1;

      // ... populate team1 with data ...

      ArenaTeam team2 = std::move(team1); // Move constructor invoked'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Move in Container Operations
    code: 'std::vector<ArenaTeam> teams;

      ArenaTeam newTeam;

      teams.push_back(std::move(newTeam)); // Efficiently moves team into vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a regular constructor. After the operation,
    the source object should be considered in a valid but unspecified state. The implementation
    assumes that ArenaTeam contains resources that can be safely moved rather than
    copied.
  warnings: Ensure that the source ArenaTeam object is not used after being moved
    from, as its internal state may be left in an undefined but valid condition. This
    constructor is typically called implicitly during move operations and should not
    be invoked directly unless explicitly needed for resource management.
