documentation:
  brief: Copies the data from another ArenaTeam object into this instance.
  description: The ArenaTeam copy constructor initializes a new ArenaTeam object by
    copying all data members from an existing ArenaTeam object. This method is typically
    used when creating a duplicate of an existing arena team, preserving all team
    properties including members, statistics, and configuration settings. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this constructor ensures that arena
    team state is properly maintained during operations such as team duplication,
    serialization, or temporary team creation for gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a copy of an existing arena team
    code: 'ArenaTeam originalTeam;

      // ... populate originalTeam with data ...

      ArenaTeam copiedTeam(originalTeam); // Uses the copy constructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a shallow copy of the ArenaTeam object's data members.
    Any pointers or complex objects within the team structure should be handled carefully
    to avoid dangling references or memory issues. The implementation assumes that
    the source ArenaTeam object is in a valid state.
  warnings: Ensure that the source ArenaTeam object is fully initialized before using
    this constructor, as copying from an uninitialized or partially constructed object
    may lead to undefined behavior. Avoid using this constructor in multithreaded
    environments without proper synchronization if the source object might be modified
    concurrently.
