documentation:
  brief: Destroys an Object instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The Object destructor is automatically invoked when an Object instance
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of the object's
    internal data structures, releases memory allocated for the object, and performs
    any necessary deinitialization tasks. In the context of TrinityCore, this destructor
    may also handle removal of the object from world systems, cleanup of associated
    AI or movement data, and notification of subsystems that the object is being destroyed.
    This method should never be called directly by user code unless explicitly managing
    object lifecycle through manual memory allocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of Object instance
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    Object* obj = new Object();\n    // ... use\
      \ obj ...\n    delete obj; // Triggers ~Object()\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based Object destruction
    code: "void anotherFunction() {\n    Object obj; // Constructor called\n    //\
      \ ... use obj ...\n    // ~Object() automatically called when obj goes out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a virtual function in the Object class hierarchy, allowing
    proper cleanup of derived classes. Developers should be aware that any custom
    cleanup logic in derived destructors must be implemented carefully to avoid undefined
    behavior or memory leaks. The destructor may also trigger events or callbacks
    depending on the object type and its role in the game world.
  warnings: Never call ~Object() directly unless you're implementing a custom memory
    management system. Doing so can lead to undefined behavior, especially if the
    object is still referenced elsewhere in the codebase. Also, be cautious when inheriting
    from Object - ensure derived class destructors properly clean up their own resources
    before calling the base destructor.
