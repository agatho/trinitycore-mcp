  method: HasFragments
  signature: bool HavocSoulFragmentTracker::HasFragments() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the HavocSoulFragmentTracker has any soul fragments available.
  description: The HasFragments method determines if there are any soul fragments
    currently tracked by the HavocSoulFragmentTracker instance. This is typically
    used in the context of Warlock class abilities, particularly those related to
    Havoc talent tree mechanics where soul fragments are collected and consumed for
    various spells. The method returns true when at least one fragment is present,
    and false otherwise. This check is essential for determining whether a player
    can use certain abilities that require soul fragments as resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the tracker contains one or more soul fragments; returns
    false if no fragments are currently being tracked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetHavocSoulFragmentTracker()->HasFragments()) {\n    // Player\
      \ can use a soul fragment consuming ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SOUL_FRAGMENTS_ABILITY,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Ability Cooldown Logic
    code: "if (player->GetHavocSoulFragmentTracker()->HasFragments() && !abilityCooldown->IsReady())\
      \ {\n    // Player has fragments but ability is on cooldown\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Ability is on cooldown.\");\n} else if (!player->GetHavocSoulFragmentTracker()->HasFragments())\
      \ {\n    // No fragments available to use\n    SendSystemMessage(\"No soul fragments\
      \ available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple check on the internal fragment count without
    modifying any state. It's commonly used in conditional logic before attempting
    to consume or spend soul fragments. The tracker likely maintains an internal counter
    or list of active fragments, and this method simply queries that data structure.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks for the presence of fragments, not
    their validity or usability. Fragments may be tracked but temporarily unavailable
    due to other game mechanics (e.g., being consumed in a different process). Always
    ensure proper validation before consuming fragments.
