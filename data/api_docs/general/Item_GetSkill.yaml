  class: Item
  method: GetSkill
  signature: uint32 Item::GetSkill()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the skill level associated with the item.
  description: The GetSkill method returns the skill level that is associated with
    the item, typically used for items that have a skill requirement or are related
    to a specific skill. This method is commonly used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to determine the skill level required for an item to be
    usable by a character. The returned value represents the skill level needed to
    use the item, which may vary depending on the item type and its associated skill
    requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the skill level required for using the item,
    typically ranging from 0 to 450. A value of 0 indicates that no skill is required,
    while higher values indicate increasing skill requirements. This value can be
    used in conjunction with other methods like GetSkillRequirement or GetItemSkill()
    to determine if a character meets the skill requirements for an item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 skillLevel = item->GetSkill();\nif (skillLevel > 0)\n{\n    // Item\
      \ requires skill to use\n    std::cout << \"Skill level required: \" << skillLevel\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No skill required\n    std::cout << \"No\
      \ skill required\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that deal
    with item skills and requirements. It may be affected by the item's associated
    skill requirement or the character's current skill level. Performance considerations
    include checking if the item has a skill requirement before calling this method.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may not always reflect the actual
    skill requirement for an item, especially in cases where items are linked to multiple
    skills or when the skill requirement is not directly tied to the item's properties.
    Also, ensure that the item object is valid before calling this method.
