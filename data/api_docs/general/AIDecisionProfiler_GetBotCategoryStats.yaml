  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: GetBotCategoryStats
  signature: CategoryPerformanceStats AIDecisionProfiler::GetBotCategoryStats(uint32_t
    botGuid, AIDecisionCategory category) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves performance statistics for a specific bot's decision-making in
    a given AI category.
  description: The GetBotCategoryStats method retrieves detailed performance metrics
    for a specified bot's behavior within a particular AI decision category. This
    function is typically used by the AIDecisionProfiler to analyze how effectively
    bots are making decisions in various contexts such as combat, movement, or resource
    management. The returned CategoryPerformanceStats object contains data about the
    bot's success rate, average response time, and other relevant metrics for the
    specified category. The method requires a valid bot GUID and a recognized AI decision
    category to return meaningful results.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which performance statistics
      are being retrieved. This must correspond to an active bot in the system.
  - name: category
    description: The AI decision category for which statistics are being gathered.
      Valid categories include combat, movement, resource management, and others defined
      by the AIDecisionCategory enum.
  returns: Returns a CategoryPerformanceStats object containing performance metrics
    such as success rate, average response time, and decision frequency for the specified
    bot and category. If no data is available for the given bot or category, an empty
    or default-initialized stats object may be returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Combat Decision Stats for a Bot
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      AIDecisionCategory category = AIDecisionCategory::Combat;

      CategoryPerformanceStats stats = profiler.GetBotCategoryStats(botGuid, category);

      // Use stats to analyze combat decision effectiveness'
    language: cpp
  - title: Analyze Multiple Bot Categories
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nfor (int i = 0; i < AIDecisionCategory::Max;\
      \ ++i) {\n    AIDecisionCategory category = static_cast<AIDecisionCategory>(i);\n\
      \    CategoryPerformanceStats stats = profiler.GetBotCategoryStats(botGuid,\
      \ category);\n    // Process and log performance data for each category\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for profiling and optimization purposes. The
    returned statistics are typically updated in real-time as bots make decisions.
    Ensure that the bot GUID corresponds to an active, running bot to get meaningful
    results.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid bot GUID or unrecognized category
    may result in undefined behavior or empty statistics. Always validate inputs before
    calling this function in production code.
