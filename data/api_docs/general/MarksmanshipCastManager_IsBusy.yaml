  class: MarksmanshipCastManager
  method: IsBusy
  signature: bool MarksmanshipCastManager::IsBusy() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the marksmanship cast manager is currently busy with an ongoing
    cast.
  description: The IsBusy method determines whether the MarksmanshipCastManager is
    currently engaged in executing a spell or ability cast. This status check is essential
    for preventing concurrent casts or actions that would interfere with the current
    casting sequence. The method typically evaluates internal state flags or active
    spell timers to make this determination. It's commonly used in game logic to ensure
    proper sequencing of abilities and prevent invalid action attempts during casting
    windows.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the cast manager is currently busy executing a cast, false
    otherwise. This indicates that no new casts can be initiated until the current
    one completes or is interrupted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Busy Check
    code: "if (marksmanshipCastManager.IsBusy()) {\n    // Prevent new casts\n   \
      \ return;\n}\n// Proceed with casting logic"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Action Handling
    code: "void Player::HandleShootSpell() {\n    if (marksmanshipCastManager.IsBusy())\
      \ {\n        SendCastFailed(SPELL_FAILED_INTERRUPTED);\n        return;\n  \
      \  }\n    // Initiate new shot cast\n    marksmanshipCastManager.StartCast(SPELL_SHOOT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and has minimal performance overhead.
    It should be called frequently during gameplay loops to maintain proper casting
    state management. The implementation likely relies on internal flags rather than
    complex calculations.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-busy state guarantees immediate cast availability,
    as other conditions (such as cooldowns or resource requirements) may still prevent
    casting. Always validate all preconditions before initiating new casts.
