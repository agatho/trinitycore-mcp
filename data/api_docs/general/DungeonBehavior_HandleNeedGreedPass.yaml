    Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a player's pass action during a Need/Greed loot roll in a dungeon
    group
  description: The HandleNeedGreedPass method manages the logic when a player chooses
    to pass on an item during a Need/Greed loot distribution system within a dungeon
    group. This method is typically invoked when a player clicks the 'Pass' button
    during a loot roll, indicating they do not wish to receive the item. The method
    updates the group's loot state, removes the player from the current loot roll,
    and may trigger further actions such as rolling for the item if no one else has
    Need or Greed on it. It ensures proper synchronization of loot distribution mechanics
    within the dungeon environment.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the dungeon group where
      the loot roll is occurring. Must be a valid group with active loot distribution.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being rolled for. Used to track
      which specific item the pass applies to within the group's current loot context.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is passing on the item. Must be
      a member of the provided group and currently participating in the loot roll.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleNeedGreedPass
    code: "void SomeDungeonAI::OnPlayerPassLoot(Group* group, uint32 itemId, Player*\
      \ player)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.HandleNeedGreedPass(group, itemId, player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and player are valid and properly initialized.
    The method does not perform explicit validation of these parameters, so callers
    should ensure preconditions are met. It's designed to be called from within the
    context of a dungeon loot distribution system where Need/Greed mechanics are active.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group or player pointer may result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the player is actually part of the group and
    currently participating in the loot roll before invoking this method. Incorrect
    usage can lead to synchronization issues within the group's loot state.
