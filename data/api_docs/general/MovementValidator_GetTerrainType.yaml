  class: MovementValidator
  method: GetTerrainType
  signature: TerrainType MovementValidator::GetTerrainType(Map * map, const int &
    position) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the terrain type at a specified position within a given map.
  description: The GetTerrainType method determines the terrain characteristics at
    a specific location on a game map. It takes a pointer to a Map object and a position
    identifier, then returns the corresponding TerrainType enum value that describes
    the terrain at that location. This functionality is essential for movement validation,
    pathfinding, and determining how units interact with different terrains in the
    game world. The method relies on the internal map data structures to accurately
    identify terrain properties such as ground type, water level, or elevation changes.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the terrain type is to be determined.
      Must not be null.
  - name: position
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position on the map.
      The exact meaning of this value depends on the internal coordinate system used
      by TrinityCore's map implementation.
  returns: Returns a TerrainType enum value indicating the terrain characteristics
    at the specified position. Possible values may include ground types like GRASS,
    STONE, WATER, etc., depending on the map data and implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Map* myMap = ...; // Assume valid map pointer

      int pos = 12345; // Some position identifier

      TerrainType type = validator.GetTerrainType(myMap, pos);

      // Use ''type'' to determine movement behavior or other game mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Map pointer is valid and initialized.
    The position parameter should correspond to a valid location within the map's
    coordinate system. Performance may be impacted if called frequently in tight loops
    without caching results.
  warnings: Ensure the Map pointer passed is not null, as dereferencing a null pointer
    will cause undefined behavior. The position value must be within the bounds of
    the map's valid coordinates to avoid accessing invalid memory locations.
