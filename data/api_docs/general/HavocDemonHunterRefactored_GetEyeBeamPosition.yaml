  class: HavocDemonHunterRefactored
  method: GetEyeBeamPosition
  signature: int HavocDemonHunterRefactored::GetEyeBeamPosition(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the position where the Havoc Demon Hunter's Eye Beam
    ability should be cast.
  description: The GetEyeBeamPosition method determines the optimal target position
    for casting the Eye Beam ability in the Havoc Demon Hunter's rotation. This method
    is typically used during AI decision-making to identify where the spell should
    be directed based on current combat state, target positioning, and game mechanics.
    The returned value represents a coordinate or identifier that indicates the calculated
    beam position within the game world. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper spell targeting and ensuring optimal damage output during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the calculated position for Eye Beam casting.
    This typically corresponds to a coordinate in the game world or an internal identifier
    used by the AI system to determine where the ability should be directed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void HavocDemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        int beamPosition = me->GetEyeBeamPosition();\n        if (beamPosition\
      \ > 0)\n        {\n            // Cast Eye Beam at calculated position\n   \
      \         DoCast(beamPosition, SPELL_EYE_BEAM);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex calculations including target positioning,
    line-of-sight checks, and optimal damage distribution. The implementation may
    cache previous positions or use advanced pathfinding algorithms to determine the
    most effective beam placement.
  warnings: The method should only be called when the Demon Hunter is in combat and
    has a valid target. Calling this method outside of combat conditions may return
    invalid or undefined values that could cause unexpected behavior.
