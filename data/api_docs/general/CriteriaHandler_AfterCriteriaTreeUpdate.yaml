  class: CriteriaHandler

  signature: void CriteriaHandler::AfterCriteriaTreeUpdate(const CriteriaTree * param0,
    Player * param1)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked after a criteria tree has been updated, allowing for post-update
    processing and synchronization.
  description: The AfterCriteriaTreeUpdate method is a callback function that executes
    immediately following any modification or update to a player's criteria tree within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method serves as a hook for additional logic that
    needs to be performed after criteria data has changed, such as updating quest
    progress, notifying clients of changes, or triggering related achievements. It
    ensures that all dependent systems are synchronized with the new criteria state
    and is typically used in conjunction with other event handlers to maintain consistency
    across the game's progression tracking systems.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the updated CriteriaTree object that has been modified.
      This represents the criteria tree structure containing player progress data,
      achievements, and related tracking information.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to the Player object associated with the criteria tree update.
      This is the player whose criteria have been modified and who will be affected
      by any subsequent processing or notifications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom module
    code: "void MyCustomModule::HandleCriteriaUpdate(const CriteriaTree* tree, Player*\
      \ player)\n{\n    // Perform custom logic after criteria tree update\n    if\
      \ (player && tree)\n    {\n        // Update UI or send packet to client\n \
      \       player->SendUpdateWorldState(2345, tree->GetCriteriaProgress());\n \
      \   }\n}\n\n// Called from CriteriaHandler::AfterCriteriaTreeUpdate\nvoid CriteriaHandler::AfterCriteriaTreeUpdate(const\
      \ CriteriaTree* param0, Player* param1)\n{\n    MyCustomModule::HandleCriteriaUpdate(param0,\
      \ param1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal event system in TrinityCore and should
    not be directly called by external modules unless implementing a custom criteria
    handler. The method may be invoked multiple times during a single player session
    depending on how many criteria updates occur, so performance-sensitive logic should
    be optimized accordingly.
  warnings: Do not modify the CriteriaTree object passed to this method directly,
    as doing so might lead to inconsistent state or crashes. Any modifications to
    criteria data should be handled through appropriate APIs rather than direct manipulation
    of the tree structure.
