  class: Item
  method: GetDisenchantLootId
  signature: int Item::GetDisenchantLootId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the loot ID used for disenchanting the item.
  description: The GetDisenchantLootId method retrieves the unique identifier that
    corresponds to the loot table used when an item is disenchanted. This value determines
    which loot entries are available for disenchanting the item, typically based on
    the item's quality and level. The method is commonly used in conjunction with
    the Disenchanting system to determine what items can be obtained from disenchanting
    a specific item. It returns an integer identifier that maps to a specific loot
    table within the game's database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the loot ID associated with the item's
    disenchanting process. This ID corresponds to a specific loot table in the database
    that defines what items can be obtained when the item is disenchanted, typically
    based on item quality and level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int disenchantLootId = item->GetDisenchantLootId();\nif (disenchantLootId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the loot ID to fetch disenchant loot entries\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Item cannot be disenchanted\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the Disenchanting system
    and related database tables. The returned value may vary based on item quality,
    level, and other factors. Performance considerations are minimal as this method
    simply retrieves a stored value from the item's data structure.
  warnings: The method returns 0 for items that cannot be disenchanted, such as those
    with no disenchanting loot table defined. Be cautious when using this method in
    contexts where item quality or level may affect the outcome.
