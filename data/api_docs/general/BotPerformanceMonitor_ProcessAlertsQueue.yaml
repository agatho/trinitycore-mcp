documentation:
  brief: Processes queued performance alerts for bot systems within the TrinityCore
    environment.
  description: The ProcessAlertsQueue method handles the execution and management
    of performance-related alerts that have been added to a queue within the BotPerformanceMonitor
    class. This method is typically invoked during periodic updates or when specific
    performance thresholds are met, ensuring that relevant alerts are processed in
    a timely manner. It evaluates queued alerts, determines their priority and relevance,
    and executes appropriate actions based on the alert type. The method plays a crucial
    role in maintaining system stability by monitoring bot performance and triggering
    corrective measures when necessary.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void BotManager::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    m_performanceMonitor.ProcessAlertsQueue();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the main game loop or periodic
    update handlers. It's important to ensure that this method does not block execution
    for extended periods as it may impact overall server performance. The implementation
    assumes that alerts are properly queued before calling this method.
