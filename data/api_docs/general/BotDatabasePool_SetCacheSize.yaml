  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: SetCacheSize
  signature: void BotDatabasePool::SetCacheSize(size_t maxSize)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum cache size for the bot database pool.
  description: The SetCacheSize method configures the maximum number of cached database
    connections that can be maintained within the BotDatabasePool. This setting directly
    impacts performance and resource utilization when managing database operations
    for bot-related activities in TrinityCore. The cache size determines how many
    database connections are kept open and ready for use, which can reduce connection
    overhead and improve response times for frequently accessed data. Adjusting this
    value should be done carefully based on system resources and expected concurrent
    bot activity levels.
  parameters:
  - name: maxSize
    description: The maximum number of database connections to cache. Must be a positive
      integer value representing the desired cache capacity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Cache Size for Bot Database Pool
    code: 'BotDatabasePool::SetCacheSize(50);

      // Configures the bot database pool to maintain up to 50 cached connections'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Cache Size Adjustment Based on Server Load
    code: "uint32 serverLoad = GetServerLoad();\nif (serverLoad > 80)\n{\n    BotDatabasePool::SetCacheSize(100);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    BotDatabasePool::SetCacheSize(25);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the internal connection pooling mechanism of the bot
    database pool. Changes to cache size take effect immediately for new connections,
    but existing cached connections remain unchanged. The implementation uses thread-safe
    operations to manage concurrent access to the cache settings.
  warnings: Setting the cache size too high may lead to excessive memory consumption
    and potential resource exhaustion on systems with limited RAM. Setting it too
    low may result in frequent connection creation/destruction overhead, impacting
    performance. This method should not be called during peak bot activity periods
    to avoid disrupting ongoing database operations.
