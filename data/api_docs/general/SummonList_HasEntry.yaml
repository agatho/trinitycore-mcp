  class: SummonList
  method: HasEntry
  signature: bool SummonList::HasEntry(int entry) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific entry exists within the summon list.
  description: The HasEntry method determines whether a given creature or game object
    entry ID is present in the SummonList. This functionality is commonly used in
    AI scripts and creature behavior logic to verify the existence of summoned creatures
    before performing operations on them. The method performs a lookup operation against
    the internal storage of summoned units, returning true if the specified entry
    is found, and false otherwise. This check is essential for preventing errors when
    attempting to interact with summons that may have been despawned or never created.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified entry ID exists in the summon list; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "if (summonList.HasEntry(12345)) {\n    // Perform action only if summon\
      \ with entry 12345 exists\n    DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Entries
    code: "if (summonList.HasEntry(12345) && summonList.HasEntry(12346)) {\n    //\
      \ Both summons exist\n    DoComplexAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the internal list of summons,
    so performance may degrade with large numbers of summons. It's recommended to
    cache results when checking for multiple entries in frequently called functions.
  warnings: The method does not validate that the entry ID corresponds to a valid
    creature or game object template; it only checks if the ID exists in the summon
    list. Ensure proper validation before using summoned units.
