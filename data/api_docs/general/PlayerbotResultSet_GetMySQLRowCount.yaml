  class: PlayerbotResultSet
  method: GetMySQLRowCount
  signature: int PlayerbotResultSet::GetMySQLRowCount(int * mysqlResult)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of rows from a MySQL result set.
  description: The GetMySQLRowCount method is used to determine the total number of
    rows returned by a MySQL query executed within the Playerbot system. This method
    takes a pointer to a MySQL result set and returns an integer representing the
    count of rows in that result set. It serves as a utility function for processing
    database query results in player bot AI logic, particularly when iterating through
    or validating query outcomes. The method assumes the provided result set pointer
    is valid and properly initialized from a previous MySQL query execution.
  parameters:
  - name: mysqlResult
    description: Pointer to a MySQL result set obtained from a previous database query
      operation. This parameter must be a valid pointer to a MYSQL_RES structure or
      NULL if no result set exists.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of rows in the provided MySQL
    result set. If the input parameter is NULL, the method returns -1 to indicate
    an error condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with valid result set
    code: "MYSQL_RES* result = mysql_store_result(&mysql_connection);\nint rowCount\
      \ = playerbotResultSet->GetMySQLRowCount(result);\nif (rowCount > 0) {\n   \
      \ // Process rows\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error handling for NULL result set
    code: "MYSQL_RES* result = mysql_store_result(&mysql_connection);\nint rowCount\
      \ = playerbotResultSet->GetMySQLRowCount(result);\nif (rowCount == -1) {\n \
      \   // Handle error case\n    Log(\"Failed to retrieve row count from MySQL\
      \ result.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Playerbot AI subsystem in TrinityCore and is designed
    to work with MySQL database operations. It should only be called after a successful
    MySQL query execution that returns a result set. The method does not perform any
    memory management on the provided result set pointer.
  warnings: Passing a NULL pointer to this method will cause it to return -1, which
    may be interpreted as an error condition in calling code. Ensure that the input
    parameter is validated before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
