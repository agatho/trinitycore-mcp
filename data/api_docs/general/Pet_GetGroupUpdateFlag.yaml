  class: Pet
  method: GetGroupUpdateFlag
  signature: uint32 Pet::GetGroupUpdateFlag() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the group update flag value for this pet.
  description: The GetGroupUpdateFlag method retrieves a 32-bit unsigned integer that
    represents the current group update flag state of the pet. This flag is used internally
    by the TrinityCore server to track changes in the pet's group status, such as
    whether it needs to be updated in the player's group update packet. The returned
    value typically corresponds to specific bit flags that indicate various states
    like whether the pet is in a group, its current health, power, or other relevant
    attributes that need synchronization with the client. This method is commonly
    used during packet construction for group-related updates and is essential for
    maintaining accurate pet state information in multiplayer environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current group update flag state of the
    pet. Each bit in this value corresponds to a specific attribute or status that
    may require client synchronization, such as health, power, or group membership
    status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check pet's group update flag
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nuint32 updateFlag = myPet->GetGroupUpdateFlag();\n\
      if (updateFlag & GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG_HEALTH)\n{\n    // Pet health needs to be\
      \ updated in the group packet\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group update processing and should
    not be used for frequent polling as it may involve internal state checks. The
    exact bit meanings are defined by the GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG_* constants within the
    TrinityCore codebase.
