  class: KitingUtils
  method: InterpolateMovementPath
  signature: int KitingUtils::InterpolateMovementPath(const int & start, const int
    & end, uint32 points)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the interpolated movement path points between two
    given positions for kiting behavior.
  description: The InterpolateMovementPath method computes a series of intermediate
    waypoints between a starting and ending position, which is essential for implementing
    smooth kiting mechanics in World of Warcraft. This functionality allows NPCs or
    players to move along a curved or straight path with defined intermediate points
    that can be used for movement animation, AI behavior, or pathfinding. The method
    takes into account the start and end coordinates and generates a specified number
    of interpolated points between them. It's commonly used in kiting scripts where
    an entity needs to maintain distance from an enemy while moving in a controlled
    manner.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting index or identifier for the movement path, typically
      representing a position in a coordinate system or path array.
  - name: end
    description: The ending index or identifier for the movement path, also typically
      representing a position in a coordinate system or path array.
  - name: points
    description: The number of intermediate points to interpolate between the start
      and end positions. Must be a positive integer.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the interpolation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values
    may indicate errors such as invalid parameters or out-of-bounds indices.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of InterpolateMovementPath
    code: "int result = KitingUtils::InterpolateMovementPath(0, 10, 5);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Successfully interpolated path with 5 points\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using InterpolateMovementPath in a kiting AI
    code: "uint32 numPoints = 8;\nint startIdx = player->GetPositionX();\nint endIdx\
      \ = enemy->GetPositionX();\nint status = KitingUtils::InterpolateMovementPath(startIdx,\
      \ endIdx, numPoints);\nif (status == 0) {\n    // Proceed with kiting movement\
      \ logic using interpolated points\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI scripting and kiting behavior implementations.
    The actual interpolation algorithm may depend on the underlying coordinate system
    or pathfinding grid used by TrinityCore. Ensure that start and end indices are
    valid within the context of your movement data structure.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values such as negative point counts or invalid start/end
    indices can lead to undefined behavior or errors. Always validate inputs before
    calling this method in production code.
