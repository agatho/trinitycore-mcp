  class: Player
  method: SetObjectScale
  signature: void Player::SetObjectScale(float scale)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the scale of the player object to the specified value.
  description: This method allows developers to adjust the visual scale of a player
    character within the game world. The scale parameter controls how large or small
    the player appears, affecting both rendering and collision detection. It is commonly
    used for adjusting player size for special effects, customizations, or gameplay
    mechanics that require altering object dimensions. This method directly modifies
    the player's scale property without requiring additional configuration or validation.
  parameters:
  - name: scale
    description: The new scale value to apply to the player object. Valid values range
      from 0.1 to 10.0, with 1.0 representing normal size. Values outside this range
      may cause rendering issues or unexpected behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Scale Adjustment
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetObjectScale(2.0f);

      // Player now appears twice normal size'
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Scale for Special Effects
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetObjectScale(0.5f);

      // Player appears half size

      // Used for special effects or gameplay mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the object scale property and affects rendering,
    collision detection, and visual appearance. It should be used carefully as it
    may impact game balance and performance. The change is immediate and does not
    require server-side updates or synchronization.
  warnings: Improper use of scale values can cause visual artifacts, rendering issues,
    or unexpected behavior in collision detection. Values outside the normal range
    (0.1-10.0) should be avoided unless specifically intended for special effects.
    This method may affect gameplay mechanics that rely on accurate object dimensions.
