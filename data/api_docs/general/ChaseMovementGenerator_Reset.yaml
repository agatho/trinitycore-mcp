  class: ChaseMovementGenerator
  method: Reset
  signature: void ChaseMovementGenerator::Reset(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the chase movement generator's state and clears any active movement
    adjustments for the target unit.
  description: The Reset method in ChaseMovementGenerator is responsible for clearing
    the internal state of the movement generator, effectively stopping any ongoing
    chase behavior and resetting its parameters. This method ensures that when a unit
    is no longer chasing a target or when the chase needs to be interrupted, the movement
    generator returns to a clean state. It typically clears cached movement data,
    resets flags, and prepares the generator for potential reuse with a new target
    or in a different context. The method is commonly invoked during AI state transitions
    or when a creature's target becomes invalid or unreachable.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose chase movement state will be reset.
      This parameter represents the unit that was previously being chased and whose
      movement behavior is now being cleared.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset Chase Movement for a Target Unit
    code: 'ChaseMovementGenerator* chaseGen = new ChaseMovementGenerator();

      Unit* targetUnit = player;

      chaseGen->Reset(targetUnit);

      // The chase movement generator is now reset and ready to be reused.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid Unit pointers. It does not perform
    any checks for null or invalid inputs, so callers must ensure the parameter is
    valid before invoking this method. The Reset operation may affect AI behavior
    in real-time, especially if invoked during active movement.
  warnings: Calling Reset on a unit that is currently engaged in combat or movement
    may cause unexpected behavior if not handled properly by the calling code. Ensure
    proper synchronization and state management when resetting movement generators.
