  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::UpdateTargetAvailability(uint32 targetId, const
    int & location)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the availability status of a target based on its ID and location
    within the objective tracker.
  description: The UpdateTargetAvailability method is responsible for adjusting the
    visibility or accessibility state of a specific target within the ObjectiveTracker
    system. This method takes a target identifier and a location parameter to determine
    how the target's availability should be updated. It likely plays a role in dynamic
    quest tracking, where targets may become available or unavailable based on player
    progress, environmental conditions, or other game events. The method operates
    within the context of the World of Warcraft TrinityCore framework, managing objective
    states for players' quest logs and UI displays.
  parameters:
  - name: targetId
    description: Unique identifier for the target whose availability status needs
      to be updated. This typically corresponds to a quest objective or NPC target
      within the game world.
  - name: location
    description: Integer value representing the location context for the target update.
      The exact meaning depends on implementation but likely indicates where in the
      UI or tracking system the target should be positioned or how it should be categorized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Target Availability for a Quest Objective
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetObjectTarget();

      tracker->UpdateTargetAvailability(12345, 0); // Mark target with ID 12345 as
      available at location 0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Availability Based on Player Progress
    code: 'uint32 currentTargetId = player->GetQuestStatus(9876)->GetQuest()->GetQuestId();

      int targetLocation = player->GetQuestStatus(9876)->GetQuest()->GetRequiredKillCount();

      tracker->UpdateTargetAvailability(currentTargetId, targetLocation);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the game engine when quest states
    change or when player actions affect objective availability. The 'location' parameter
    may influence how targets are displayed in the UI or sorted within the tracker.
    Developers should be aware that this method might trigger UI updates or event
    notifications related to quest progression.
  warnings: Incorrect targetId values could lead to undefined behavior or missing
    updates in the objective tracker. The location parameter's interpretation should
    be verified against existing codebase documentation as it may vary based on context
    (e.g., different UI panels, tracking categories).
