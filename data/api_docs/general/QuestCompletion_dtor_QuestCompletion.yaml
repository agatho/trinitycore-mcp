documentation:
  brief: Destroys a QuestCompletion object and releases its associated resources.
  description: The QuestCompletion destructor is automatically invoked when a QuestCompletion
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal data structures, memory allocations, or references held
    by the QuestCompletion instance. In the context of TrinityCore's quest system,
    this typically occurs when quest completion logic is finalized or discarded. The
    destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return operations. It
    is important to note that developers should not manually invoke this destructor
    unless explicitly managing object lifecycle through custom memory allocation.

  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void HandleQuestCompletion()\n{\n    QuestCompletion completion;\n    //\
      \ ... quest completion logic ...\n    // completion is automatically destroyed\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion (if needed)
    code: 'QuestCompletion* completion = new QuestCompletion();

      // ... use completion ...

      del completion; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The QuestCompletion destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when
    objects go out of scope. Developers should not call this destructor directly unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process ensures
    all internal resources are properly released, preventing memory leaks in the quest
    completion system.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke the destructor using syntax like 'completion.~QuestCompletion();'
    as this can lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption. Always let the C++
    runtime handle object destruction through normal scope rules or explicit deletion.
