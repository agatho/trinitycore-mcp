  signature: bool Unit::IsDamageReducedByArmor(int damageSchoolMask, const SpellInfo
    * spellInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether damage is reduced by armor for a given spell.
  description: This method checks if the specified spell's damage is reduced by armor.
    It evaluates the damage school mask and spell information to determine if armor
    reduction applies. The method is used in combat calculations where armor can reduce
    incoming damage, particularly for physical attacks. This functionality is essential
    for understanding how damage reduction works in World of Warcraft mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the damage is reduced by armor, false otherwise. The method
    returns false when armor does not apply to the specified spell or school mask.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: bool isReduced = unit->IsDamageReducedByArmor(0x1, spellInfo);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat calculations and damage reduction
    logic. It's important to note that armor reduction only applies to certain types
    of damage (e.g., physical attacks). The method may be called during spell processing
    or damage calculation phases.
  warnings: The method should not be used for non-physical damage types as it may
    produce incorrect results. Also, ensure that the spellInfo parameter is valid
    before calling this method, otherwise it could lead to undefined behavior.
