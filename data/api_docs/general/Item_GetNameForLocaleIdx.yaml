  method: GetNameForLocaleIdx
  signature: std::string Item::GetNameForLocaleIdx(LocaleConstant locale) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the localized name of an item based on the specified locale constant.
  description: This method retrieves the localized name of an Item object using the
    provided LocaleConstant parameter. It is used to obtain the appropriate name for
    a specific language or region, allowing developers to access localized item names
    in various languages. The method operates on the item's internal data structure
    and returns the name according to the locale specified. This functionality is
    essential for implementing localization features within World of Warcraft client
    applications and server-side code.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::string containing the localized name of the item based on
    the specified locale. If no valid localization exists for the given locale, it
    returns an empty string.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      LocaleConstant locale = LOCALE_en;

      std::string name = item->GetNameForLocaleIdx(locale);

      // Returns the English name of the item'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal caching mechanisms to efficiently retrieve
    localized names. Performance considerations may arise when repeatedly accessing
    different locales for the same item object.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method with different locale constants,
    as incorrect usage can lead to invalid or empty string returns if localization
    data is not properly configured.
