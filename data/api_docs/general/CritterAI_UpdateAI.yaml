  class: CritterAI
  method: UpdateAI
  signature: void CritterAI::UpdateAI(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the critter's AI behavior based on elapsed time and game state.
  description: The UpdateAI method is responsible for executing the artificial intelligence
    logic of a critter creature in World of Warcraft. It processes the critter's current
    behavior, handles movement, combat states, and other AI-related actions based
    on the time elapsed since the last update (diff parameter). This method is called
    regularly by the game engine to ensure that critters behave realistically within
    the game world. The implementation typically includes checks for target acquisition,
    movement patterns, and state transitions such as entering or exiting combat.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last AI update call.
      This value is used to determine how much time has passed for AI decision-making,
      pathfinding, and behavior updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateAI Call
    code: "void SomeCritter::UpdateAI(int diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \     return;\n\n    // Perform critter-specific AI logic here\n    if (me->IsWithinMeleeRange(victim))\n\
      \        DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n    else\n        DoSpellAttackIfReady();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI update cycle in TrinityCore. Developers
    should not directly call this method unless implementing custom AI logic. The
    diff parameter represents real-time delta and must be handled carefully to ensure
    consistent behavior across different server loads.
