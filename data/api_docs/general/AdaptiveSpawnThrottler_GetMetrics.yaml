documentation:
  brief: Retrieves current throttling metrics from the adaptive spawn throttler
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a ThrottlerMetrics structure containing
    statistical information about the current state of the adaptive spawn throttler.
    This includes data such as spawn rates, success rates, and performance metrics
    that help monitor and adjust the dynamic spawning behavior in World of Warcraft
    environments. The returned metrics are used internally by the throttler to make
    decisions about future spawn operations and can be accessed for debugging or monitoring
    purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ThrottlerMetrics object containing current throttling statistics including
    spawn rate, success rate, and performance data that reflects the adaptive spawning
    behavior of the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;

      ThrottlerMetrics metrics = throttler.GetMetrics();

      std::cout << "Current spawn rate: " << metrics.spawnRate << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned metrics are snapshots at the time of the call and may not reflect real-time
    changes in the throttler's state.
