  brief: Handles database query timeout events for bot-related operations
  description: The HandleQueryTimeout method processes timeout occurrences during
    database queries executed by the bot system. This method is invoked when a database
    operation exceeds its configured timeout limit, allowing the system to gracefully
    handle failed queries and potentially retry or log the failure. The method ensures
    that bot database operations do not hang indefinitely and maintains system stability
    by properly managing query lifecycle events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic timeout handling
    code: "void BotDatabasePool::HandleQueryTimeout(const QueryRequest& request)\n\
      {\n    // Log the timeout event\n    sLog->outError(\"Bot database query timed\
      \ out for request: %s\", request.GetQueryString());\n    \n    // Mark the query\
      \ as failed in bot system\n    if (request.GetCallback())\n        request.GetCallback()->OnTimeout();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the database thread pool's timeout handler.
    It should not perform heavy operations as it may block other query processing.
    The method assumes that the QueryRequest object contains valid data and that callbacks
    are properly initialized.
  warnings: Do not modify the request object directly within this method as it may
    cause race conditions. Ensure all callback invocations are thread-safe to prevent
    undefined behavior in multi-threaded database environments.
