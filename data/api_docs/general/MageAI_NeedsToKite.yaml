  signature: bool MageAI::NeedsToKite(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Mage AI should initiate a kiting strategy against
    the specified target.
  description: The NeedsToKite method evaluates the current combat situation for a
    Mage AI-controlled unit to decide if it should employ a kiting tactic. Kiting
    involves maintaining distance from an enemy while dealing damage, typically used
    when the mage is outmatched in melee combat or when specific spell mechanics require
    sustained distance. This method considers factors such as target proximity, available
    mana, and spell cooldowns to make this decision. The AI uses this information
    to determine if it should move away from the target rather than engaging directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Mage AI should begin kiting the target; otherwise returns
    false if direct engagement or other tactics are preferred.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Decision
    code: "if (mageAI->NeedsToKite(target)) {\n    mageAI->SetCombatStyle(MageAI::KITE);\n\
      \    // Initiate kiting behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Mage AI's decision-making framework and integrates
    with other combat behaviors. It may be called frequently during combat updates,
    so performance should be considered for complex logic.
