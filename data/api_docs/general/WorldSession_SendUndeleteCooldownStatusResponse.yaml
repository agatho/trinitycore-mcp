  class: WorldSession
  method: SendUndeleteCooldownStatusResponse
  signature: void WorldSession::SendUndeleteCooldownStatusResponse(uint32 currentCooldown,
    uint32 maxCooldown)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a cooldown status response for undelete operations to the client.
  description: This method sends a packet to the connected client containing information
    about the current and maximum cooldown periods for undelete functionality. The
    undelete feature allows players to recover deleted characters within a specified
    time window, and this method communicates the cooldown state to the player's interface.
    The method is typically invoked when a player attempts to undelete a character
    or when the cooldown status needs to be refreshed in the user interface.
  parameters:
  - name: currentCooldown
    description: The current remaining time (in seconds) before the player can perform
      another undelete operation. A value of 0 indicates no active cooldown.
  - name: maxCooldown
    description: The maximum cooldown duration (in seconds) that applies to undelete
      operations for this player or account. This defines the total cooldown period.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Undelete Cooldown Status
    code: "void Player::HandleUndeleteRequest()\n{\n    uint32 currentCooldown = sWorld->getBoolConfig(CONFIG_UNDELETE_COOLDOWN_CURRENT);\n\
      \    uint32 maxCooldown = sWorld->getBoolConfig(CONFIG_UNDELETE_COOLDOWN_MAX);\n\
      \    SendUndeleteCooldownStatusResponse(currentCooldown, maxCooldown);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client's packet system and should
    only be called from within a valid WorldSession context. The cooldown values are
    typically configured via server configuration files or database entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the cooldown values passed to this method are accurate and
    reflect the actual game rules. Incorrect values may lead to user confusion or
    exploit opportunities in character management systems.
