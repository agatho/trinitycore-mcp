documentation:
  brief: Sets achievement tracking for guild members based on provided achievement
    IDs.
  description: The HandleSetAchievementTracking method configures which achievements
    are tracked within a guild. It processes a range of achievement IDs provided by
    the client session and updates the guild's tracking state accordingly. This functionality
    allows guilds to monitor specific achievements across their members, potentially
    for rewards or progress tracking. The method operates on the assumption that the
    session is valid and has appropriate permissions to modify guild settings. No
    direct return value is expected as this is a void function designed for side effects.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client connection
      initiating the request.
  - name: achievementIdsBegin
    description: Iterator pointing to the beginning of a range of achievement IDs
      to be processed for tracking.
  - name: achievementIdsEnd
    description: Iterator pointing to the end of a range of achievement IDs to be
      processed for tracking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::vector<uint32> achievements = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      guild->HandleSetAchievementTracking(session, achievements.begin(), achievements.end());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild tracking systems and may
    involve serialization of data to persist changes. It should be called only when
    the session is authenticated and has sufficient privileges to manage guild settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the achievement IDs provided are valid and exist in the game's
    database; invalid IDs might lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior. This
    method modifies global state and should not be invoked without proper authorization
    checks.
