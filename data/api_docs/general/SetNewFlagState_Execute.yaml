documentation:
  brief: Updates the flag state of a game object type base.
  description: The SetNewFlagState::Execute method is responsible for updating or
    setting the flag state associated with a GameObjectTypeBase instance. This method
    likely modifies internal flags that control how the game object behaves, such
    as whether it's active, visible, or interactable. The operation is performed in-place
    on the provided GameObjectTypeBase reference and does not return any value. It
    is typically invoked during game object initialization or state transitions within
    the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Updating Flag State for a Game Object
    code: 'GameObjectTypeBase type;

      SetNewFlagState executor;

      executor.Execute(type);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the GameObjectTypeBase object directly and modifies
    its internal flag state. It is expected to be called during initialization or
    state change events in the game loop. The exact behavior of flag manipulation
    depends on the specific implementation within TrinityCore's GameObject system.
