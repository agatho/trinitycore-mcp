  signature: void QuestValidation::UpdateValidationMetrics(bool wasSuccessful, uint32
    validationTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal validation metrics with success status and execution time
    for quest validation operations.
  description: The UpdateValidationMetrics method is responsible for recording and
    maintaining performance and success statistics related to quest validation processes
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method accepts a boolean flag indicating
    whether the validation was successful and a uint32 value representing the time
    taken to complete the validation in milliseconds. It updates internal tracking
    mechanisms such as counters for successful/failed validations and average execution
    times, which are typically used for monitoring system performance, debugging,
    or generating administrative reports on quest-related operations. The method is
    generally called after a quest validation attempt concludes, either successfully
    or with an error, allowing the system to maintain accurate metrics for operational
    insights.
  parameters:
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the quest validation completed
      successfully (true) or failed (false).
  - name: validationTime
    description: The time taken to perform the validation in milliseconds. This value
      is used to calculate average execution times and performance metrics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'QuestValidation validation;

      bool success = true;

      uint32 timeTaken = 150;

      validation.UpdateValidationMetrics(success, timeTaken);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Validation Callback Context
    code: "void OnQuestValidate(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    bool isValid\
      \ = ValidateQuest(player, questId);\n    uint32 startTime = getMSTime();\n \
      \   // ... validation logic here ...\n    uint32 endTime = getMSTime();\n  \
      \  QuestValidation::Instance().UpdateValidationMetrics(isValid, endTime - startTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger metrics collection system and may
    be called from multiple threads. It's important to ensure thread safety if internal
    data structures are not already protected. The method does not return any value,
    but it modifies internal state that can be accessed via other methods like GetValidationStats().
  warnings: Ensure that validationTime is always a positive integer or zero, as negative
    values may skew average calculations. Also, calling this method frequently without
    proper batching or logging could impact performance in high-traffic scenarios.
