documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the container data object
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask flag within
    a ContainerData object. This is typically used to indicate that all previously
    marked changes have been processed or acknowledged, effectively clearing the dirty
    state of the container. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this method helps manage synchronization between server-side data and client-side
    updates for container contents, ensuring that only relevant changes are sent to
    players. The operation does not modify the actual container contents but rather
    the tracking mechanism that indicates which aspects of the container have been
    modified.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ContainerData* container = new ContainerData();

      // ... modify container contents ...

      container->ClearChangesMask(); // Reset changes mask after processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called after sending updates to clients or when acknowledging
    that all pending changes have been properly handled. It's part of the internal
    state management system for container objects in TrinityCore's object model.
