  class: BotLevelManager
  method: SelectLevel
  signature: void BotLevelManager::SelectLevel(BotCreationTask * task)
documentation:
  brief: Selects an appropriate level for a bot based on the provided creation task
    parameters.
  description: The SelectLevel method determines the optimal level for a bot to be
    created at, taking into account various factors such as the player's current level,
    available bot level ranges, and any specific requirements defined in the BotCreationTask.
    This method is typically invoked during the bot creation process to ensure that
    bots are generated at appropriate levels that align with game balance and player
    progression. The selected level is then used to initialize the bot's attributes
    and behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: task
    description: A pointer to a BotCreationTask object containing the parameters and
      constraints for bot creation, including desired level ranges, player context,
      and other relevant configuration settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Creation
    code: 'BotCreationTask* task = new BotCreationTask();

      task->SetPlayerLevel(10);

      task->SetMinBotLevel(5);

      task->SetMaxBotLevel(15);

      BotLevelManager levelManager;

      levelManager.SelectLevel(task);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal logic to determine the appropriate bot level
    based on game balance rules and player context. It may perform calculations involving
    level differences, progression curves, and server configuration settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotCreationTask passed to this method is properly initialized
    with valid parameters; otherwise, unexpected behavior or invalid level selection
    may occur.
