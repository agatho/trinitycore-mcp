  class: FriendlyMissingBuffInRange
  method: FriendlyMissingBuffInRange
  signature: void FriendlyMissingBuffInRange::FriendlyMissingBuffInRange(const int
    * obj, float range, int spellid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks for friendly units within a specified range that are missing a particular
    buff.
  description: The FriendlyMissingBuffInRange method evaluates all friendly units
    within the given range and identifies those that do not possess the specified
    spell buff. This function is typically used in AI scripts to determine which allies
    require healing or buffing. The method operates on a provided object reference
    (likely a unit) as the center point for range calculations, checking each nearby
    friendly target against the buff condition. It does not return any value but is
    intended to be used within conditional logic or action sequences.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to an object (likely a Unit) that serves as the center point
      for range calculations. This parameter defines where the search begins.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance in yards from the 'obj' within which friendly
      units will be checked for the buff. Must be a positive value.
  - name: spellid
    description: The ID of the spell/buff to check for. Units missing this spell will
      be considered as matching the condition.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "void AI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n \
      \       FriendlyMissingBuffInRange(&me, 30.0f, 12345); // Check for missing\
      \ buff ID 12345 within 30 yards\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in custom AI behavior scripts to trigger actions
    like casting buffs or healing when friendly units are missing specific auras.
    It's important to ensure that the spell ID provided corresponds to an actual buff
    that can be checked for existence on units.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'obj' parameter points to a valid unit, otherwise undefined
    behavior may occur. Also, be cautious with large ranges as performance could degrade
    if many units are within proximity.
