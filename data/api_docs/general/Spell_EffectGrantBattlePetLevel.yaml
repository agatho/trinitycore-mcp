  brief: Grants battle pet level to player's battle pet
  description: This method is responsible for increasing the level of a player's battle
    pet by one level. It typically occurs during spell effects where the player's
    battle pet needs to be upgraded to match the spell's level requirements or when
    the spell is applied to enhance the pet's capabilities. The method operates within
    the context of World of Warcraft's battle pet system and is part of the spell
    handling mechanism that affects pet behavior.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectGrantBattlePetLevel();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires the presence of a battle pet in the player's
    inventory to function properly. It may be part of a larger spell effect handling
    system and should only be called when appropriate conditions are met.
  warnings: Improper usage can lead to incorrect pet level adjustments, potentially
    causing game balance issues or unexpected behavior in battle pet systems.
