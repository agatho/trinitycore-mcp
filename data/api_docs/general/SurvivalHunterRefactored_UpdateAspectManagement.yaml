  method: UpdateAspectManagement
  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::UpdateAspectManagement()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the hunter's aspect management logic including aspect application,
    removal, and cooldown handling.
  description: The UpdateAspectManagement method is responsible for managing all aspects
    of aspect usage within the Survival Hunter AI. This includes checking if an aspect
    should be applied or removed based on current combat state, handling aspect cooldowns,
    ensuring proper resource management, and maintaining the correct aspect state
    for optimal survival gameplay. The method evaluates various conditions such as
    target threat levels, player health, mana availability, and environmental factors
    to determine when aspects should be active or inactive. It also ensures that aspects
    are properly initialized upon entering combat and cleaned up when leaving combat.

  - title: Basic Aspect Management Update
    code: "void UpdateAspectManagement()\n{\n    // This method is typically called\
      \ from the main AI update loop\n    // It handles all aspect-related logic internally\n\
      \    if (m_player->IsInCombat())\n    {\n        // Aspect management logic\
      \ here\n        m_aspectManager.Update();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    proper aspect state management. The implementation likely involves checking multiple
    conditions and may have performance implications if not optimized properly. Aspect
    cooldowns are typically handled internally by the method.
  warnings: Improper handling of aspect states can lead to incorrect behavior in survival
    gameplay, potentially causing the hunter to miss optimal aspect usage windows
    or apply aspects at inappropriate times. Ensure this method is called consistently
    during AI updates to maintain proper aspect state.
