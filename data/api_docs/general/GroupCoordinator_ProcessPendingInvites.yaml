  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: ProcessPendingInvites
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::ProcessPendingInvites(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes pending group invites for players in the coordinator's system.
  description: The ProcessPendingInvites method handles the logic for processing group
    invitations that are currently pending in the GroupCoordinator's queue. This method
    is typically called during the game loop to check for and handle any pending invite
    requests, ensuring that players are properly added to groups when invitations
    are accepted or rejected. It manages the state transitions of pending invites
    and updates the group membership accordingly. The method operates on a time-based
    diff parameter to determine how often processing should occur, allowing for efficient
    handling without overloading the system with frequent checks.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since last invocation, used to control
      processing frequency and timing of invite handling operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    static uint32 lastInviteProcess = 0;\n    uint32\
      \ diff = getMSTime() - lastInviteProcess;\n    if (diff >= 1000) // Process\
      \ every second\n    {\n        groupCoordinator->ProcessPendingInvites(diff);\n\
      \        lastInviteProcess = getMSTime();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called regularly from the main game loop. The
    diff parameter should represent time elapsed since last call to ensure proper
    timing of invite processing. It's important that this method doesn't block or
    perform heavy operations as it's called frequently during gameplay.
