  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: IsInitialized
  signature: bool BotPacketRelay::IsInitialized()
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot packet relay system has been properly initialized
    and is ready for use.
  description: The IsInitialized method determines if the BotPacketRelay class has
    completed its initialization process and is fully functional. This method typically
    checks internal flags or state variables that indicate whether all required resources
    have been allocated, configuration settings have been loaded, and the relay system
    is prepared to handle packet forwarding operations between bots and the game server.
    The method is commonly used before attempting to send or receive packets through
    the relay system to ensure system integrity and prevent runtime errors. It serves
    as a safety check in the bot management subsystem of TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotPacketRelay has been successfully initialized and
    is ready for packet operations; returns false if initialization has not yet occurred
    or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "if (botPacketRelay.IsInitialized()) {\n    // Proceed with bot packet operations\n\
      \    botPacketRelay.SendPacket(packet);\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outError(\"BotPacketRelay not initialized\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during bot startup sequences and
    packet processing to ensure system readiness. It's a lightweight check that should
    not introduce significant performance overhead.
