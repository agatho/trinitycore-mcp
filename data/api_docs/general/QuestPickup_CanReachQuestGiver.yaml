  class: QuestPickup
  method: CanReachQuestGiver
  signature: bool QuestPickup::CanReachQuestGiver(Player * bot, uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot player can reach the quest giver for a given quest.
  description: The CanReachQuestGiver method evaluates if a specified bot player can
    physically reach the quest giver associated with a particular quest. This method
    is typically used in AI-driven questing logic to ensure that the bot will not
    attempt to interact with a quest giver that is unreachable due to distance, obstacles,
    or other environmental constraints. It considers factors such as the player's
    current position, movement capabilities, and the quest giver's location within
    the game world. The method returns true if the bot can reach the quest giver,
    and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is being evaluated
      for reachability.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver entity in the game
      world.
  returns: Returns true if the bot can physically reach the quest giver, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the bot's current position and movement abilities allow
    it to interact with the quest giver.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CanReachQuestGiver
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nuint32 questGiverGuid\
      \ = 12345;\nif (bot->CanReachQuestGiver(bot, questGiverGuid)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest interaction logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Handle unreachable quest giver\
      \ case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses pathfinding or distance calculations to determine
    reachability. It may be called frequently during AI questing routines, so performance
    is important. The method might also consider the bot's movement type (e.g., flying,
    swimming) when evaluating reachability.
  warnings: Ensure that the questGiverGuid corresponds to a valid and active quest
    giver in the game world; otherwise, the behavior of this method may be undefined
    or unreliable.
