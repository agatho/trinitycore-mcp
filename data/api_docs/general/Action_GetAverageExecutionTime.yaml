  class: Action
  method: GetAverageExecutionTime
  signature: std::chrono::milliseconds Action::GetAverageExecutionTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average execution time of the action over its
    lifetime.
  description: The GetAverageExecutionTime method computes the average duration in
    milliseconds that the action has taken to execute. This value is typically updated
    each time the action completes a run, maintaining a running average based on historical
    execution data. The method is useful for performance monitoring and optimization
    purposes within the AI system. It provides insight into how efficiently an action
    is performing and can help identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement in behavior
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::chrono::milliseconds object representing the average execution time
    of the action. Returns zero milliseconds if no executions have occurred yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Action Performance
    code: "Action* myAction = ...;\nstd::chrono::milliseconds avgTime = myAction->GetAverageExecutionTime();\n\
      if (avgTime.count() > 100) {\n    // Log performance warning\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Warning: Action execution time exceeds 100ms\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Average Execution Time for AI Decision Making
    code: "Action* moveAction = ...;\nstd::chrono::milliseconds avgTime = moveAction->GetAverageExecutionTime();\n\
      if (avgTime.count() > 50) {\n    // Adjust AI behavior due to slow execution\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Adjusting movement strategy due to slow action execution\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal timing mechanisms and assumes that the action's
    execution times are recorded properly. The average is calculated using a running
    total and count of executions, which means it may not reflect instantaneous performance
    but rather long-term behavior. The implementation should be thread-safe if used
    in multi-threaded AI contexts.
  warnings: Do not rely on this value for real-time decision making without considering
    potential staleness. If the action has never been executed, the returned value
    will be zero milliseconds, which might be misinterpreted as a valid performance
    metric.
