documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask for collectable source tracked data, resetting its
    modified state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a CollectableSourceTrackedData
    object. This operation indicates that any previously marked modifications to the
    collectable source data have been acknowledged and should no longer be considered
    as pending changes. The method is typically used in synchronization contexts where
    tracked data needs to be reset after being processed or sent to clients. It ensures
    that subsequent checks for changes will not report previously handled modifications,
    effectively clearing the dirty state of the object.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CollectableSourceTrackedData data;

      // ... modify data ...

      data.ClearChangesMask();

      // Changes mask is now cleared, no pending changes remain'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after processing or sending collectable source
    data to ensure that subsequent change detection operates correctly. The operation
    is typically lightweight and does not involve complex computations.
