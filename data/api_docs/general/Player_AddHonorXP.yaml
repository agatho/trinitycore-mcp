documentation:
  brief: Adds honor points to the player's honor system.
  description: This method adds a specified amount of honor experience points to the
    player's current honor total. It is used primarily for rewarding players with
    honor points for various in-game activities such as completing quests, participating
    in battlegrounds, or defeating world bosses. The method updates the player's honor
    points counter and may trigger honor level-up notifications if the added XP brings
    the player to a new honor level. This method is typically used during gameplay
    events or when awarding rewards to players.
  parameters:
  - name: xp
    description: The amount of honor experience points to add to the player's honor
      total. Valid values are positive integers representing honor points.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->AddHonorXP(100);

      // Adds 100 honor points to the player''s current honor total'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly update the player's honor level or notify the
    player of level-ups. It simply adds the specified amount of XP to the honor total,
    which may result in a level-up if the player reaches the required amount for the
    next honor level.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with large values as it can cause immediate
    level-ups and potentially trigger notifications or rewards that may not be expected
    by the player. Also, ensure that the value passed is valid and positive to avoid
    unexpected behavior.
