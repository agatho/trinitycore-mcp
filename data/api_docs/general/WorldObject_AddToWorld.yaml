  brief: Adds the WorldObject to the world map, making it visible to players and other
    objects.
  description: The AddToWorld method is responsible for placing a WorldObject into
    the game world environment, ensuring that it becomes accessible to players and
    other game entities. This method typically involves adding the object to the appropriate
    spatial grid cells and updating the object's visibility status within the game
    world. It is commonly used during object creation or when objects need to be made
    visible after being hidden or removed from the world. The method is part of the
    core WorldObject lifecycle and is essential for proper game mechanics implementation.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      obj->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only after the object has been properly initialized
    and configured. It typically involves updating spatial grid information and may
    trigger additional internal updates depending on the type of object being added.
  warnings: Improper use of AddToWorld can lead to objects not appearing in the game
    world or causing spatial grid issues. Care must be taken to ensure that the object
    is fully initialized before calling this method.
