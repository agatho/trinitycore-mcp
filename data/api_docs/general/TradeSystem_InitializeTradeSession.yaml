  signature: void TradeSystem::InitializeTradeSession(TradeSession & session)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a trade session between two players in the World of Warcraft
    server.
  description: The InitializeTradeSession method sets up the necessary data structures
    and state for a new trade interaction between two players. It prepares the trade
    session by initializing trade items, setting up player references, and ensuring
    both parties are in a valid state to begin trading. This method is typically called
    when a player initiates a trade with another player, and it handles the initial
    setup required for the trade system to function correctly. The method ensures
    that both players can add items to the trade window and that the trade can proceed
    according to World of Warcraft's trading mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Session Initialization
    code: 'TradeSession session;

      tradeSystem.InitializeTradeSession(session);

      // The trade session is now ready for players to add items'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the TradeSession object has been properly allocated
    and that both players involved in the trade are valid. It does not perform any
    validation of player states or item eligibility - those checks should be performed
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper preconditions may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that both players are in the same zone, within trading
    distance, and that neither is in a combat state before initializing the trade
    session.
