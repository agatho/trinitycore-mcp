documentation:
  brief: Resets the crowd control state and clears all active crowd control effects
    from the manager.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the CrowdControlManager
    by clearing all currently applied crowd control effects and resetting internal
    state tracking. This method ensures that the manager starts with a clean slate,
    removing any lingering effects that may have been active. It is typically invoked
    during object initialization, when switching between different game states, or
    when explicitly clearing all crowd control interactions. The method does not take
    any parameters and performs no return operations, making it a simple state reset
    utility.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'CrowdControlManager manager;

      manager.Reset(); // Clears all active crowd control effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve iterating through and removing active effects from the system.
    It is recommended to use this only when necessary to avoid unnecessary overhead.
