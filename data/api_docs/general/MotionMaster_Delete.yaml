  signature: void MotionMaster::Delete(MovementGenerator * movement, bool active,
    bool movementInform)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a movement generator from the motion master's active movements.
  description: The Delete method removes a specified MovementGenerator from the MotionMaster's
    internal list of active movements. This method is typically called when a movement
    generator needs to be terminated or cleaned up, such as when a creature stops
    following a path or when a unit's movement state changes. The method handles cleanup
    of the movement generator and ensures that any associated resources are properly
    released. It also supports optional notifications for movement completion events.
  parameters:
  - name: movement
    description: Pointer to the MovementGenerator object to be removed from the motion
      master's active movements list. Must not be null.
  - name: active
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the movement should be marked as
      inactive during deletion. If true, the movement is removed from active tracking.
  - name: movementInform
    description: Boolean flag that determines if a movement inform event should be
      sent to notify other systems about the movement termination.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Deletion
    code: 'MovementGenerator* mg = new ChaseMovementGenerator();

      motionMaster->Add(mg);

      // ... later on

      motionMaster->Delete(mg, true, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Deletion with Notification
    code: "MovementGenerator* mg = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovement();\n\
      if (mg)\n{\n    unit->GetMotionMaster()->Delete(mg, true, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided MovementGenerator pointer is valid
    and managed by the MotionMaster. It's important to ensure that no other references
    to the movement generator exist after calling Delete to prevent memory leaks or
    dangling pointers.
  warnings: Calling Delete with a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior.
    Always verify that the movement generator exists before attempting deletion.
