documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the RestInfo object, resetting its modified state
    flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a RestInfo
    object, effectively marking all fields as unmodified. This is typically used after
    synchronizing or processing changes to ensure that subsequent modifications can
    be properly tracked. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method
    helps manage the state of player rest information, such as experience gains, rested
    XP, and other related attributes that may be flagged for synchronization with
    the client. The operation does not alter any actual data values but only clears
    the tracking mechanism used to identify which fields have been modified since
    the last reset.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'RestInfo restInfo;

      // ... modify some fields ...

      restInfo.ClearChangesMask();

      // All changes are now marked as processed and cleared'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called internally by the core system after sending
    updates to clients or when explicitly resetting the state of a RestInfo object.
    It's important to understand that clearing the mask does not reset the actual
    values stored in the object, only the change tracking flags.
