  signature: void CalendarMgr::SendCalendarEventUpdateAlert(const CalendarEvent &
    calendarEvent, time_t originalDate) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar event update alert to all invited players.
  description: The SendCalendarEventUpdateAlert method notifies all players who have
    been invited to a specific calendar event that the event has been updated. This
    includes sending a packet to each invited player's client to refresh their calendar
    event information. The method takes the updated calendar event and its original
    date as parameters, ensuring that the alert is properly formatted with the correct
    timing information. This functionality is crucial for maintaining synchronization
    between the server's calendar state and players' local calendars in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: A const reference to the updated CalendarEvent object containing
      the new event details that need to be communicated to all invitees.
  - name: originalDate
    description: The original timestamp of when the event was first scheduled, used
      to properly format and display the event's timing information in the alert.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending an event update alert for a modified raid
    code: 'CalendarEvent updatedRaidEvent;

      // ... populate event details ...

      CalendarMgr::instance()->SendCalendarEventUpdateAlert(updatedRaidEvent, originalEventDate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the calendar system when an
    event is modified. It handles the communication with all invited players and does
    not require explicit player targeting. The method assumes that the calendar event
    has already been updated in the database or memory structures.
