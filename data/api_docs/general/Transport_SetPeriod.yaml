  class: Transport
  method: SetPeriod
  signature: void Transport::SetPeriod(int period)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the movement period of the transport object.
  description: The SetPeriod method configures the time interval in milliseconds at
    which the transport object updates its position and orientation. This is essential
    for controlling the speed and timing of transport vehicles such as boats, zeppelins,
    or other moving platforms within Azeroth. The period determines how frequently
    the transport's movement calculations are performed and how often its passengers
    are updated in the game world. This method directly affects the smoothness and
    synchronization of transport movement with player actions and world events.
  parameters:
  - name: period
    description: The time interval in milliseconds between position updates for the
      transport. Valid values are positive integers representing the update frequency.
      Smaller values result in smoother movement but may increase CPU usage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Transport Movement Period
    code: 'Transport* myTransport = ...; // Assume transport is initialized

      myTransport->SetPeriod(100); // Update position every 100ms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Period for Smooth Transport Animation
    code: "Transport* ferry = sObjectMgr->GetTransport(12345);\nif (ferry)\n{\n  \
      \  ferry->SetPeriod(50); // Faster updates for smoother animation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during transport initialization or when adjusting
    movement behavior dynamically. The period value directly influences the frequency
    of calls to internal movement update functions and affects synchronization with
    player movement.
  warnings: Setting very small period values may cause performance issues due to increased
    CPU load from frequent position updates. Ensure that the period is appropriate
    for the transport's intended speed and movement pattern.
