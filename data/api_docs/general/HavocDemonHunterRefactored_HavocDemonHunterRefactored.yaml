  signature: void HavocDemonHunterRefactored::HavocDemonHunterRefactored(Player *
    bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Havoc Demon Hunter AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The HavocDemonHunterRefactored constructor initializes a new instance
    of the HavocDemonHunterRefactored AI class, setting up internal state and configuration
    for a Demon Hunter character specialized in havoc specialization. This method
    prepares the bot for gameplay by configuring its abilities, talents, and behavior
    patterns according to the havoc demon hunter class mechanics. The initialization
    process includes setting up spell caches, ability priorities, and combat routines
    specific to the havoc specialization. It ensures that the AI bot is ready to execute
    combat decisions and actions within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      HavocDemonHunterRefactored havocBot(bot);

      // Bot is now initialized and ready for combat'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes the provided Player object has been properly initialized
    with valid Demon Hunter character data. The AI implementation relies on TrinityCore's
    internal spell and ability systems to function correctly. Performance considerations
    include caching of spell information and initialization overhead which should
    be minimal during bot creation.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player parameter is not null or invalid before calling
    this constructor. Improper initialization may lead to undefined behavior during
    combat execution. The AI system requires proper class specialization data to function
    correctly.
