  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: SendError
  signature: void BattlePetMgr::SendError(BattlePetError error, int creatureId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a battle pet error message to the client with specified error code
    and creature ID.
  description: The SendError method is used within the BattlePetMgr class to communicate
    battle pet related errors back to the player's client. It takes a BattlePetError
    enumeration value and an integer creature ID, which together define the specific
    error condition that occurred during a battle pet interaction. This method likely
    constructs and sends a network packet to the connected client to display appropriate
    error messages or handle failed operations such as invalid pet actions, summoning
    failures, or other battle pet related issues. The method does not return any value
    and is typically called internally by the BattlePetMgr when validation fails or
    an operation cannot be completed successfully.
  parameters:
  - name: error
    description: The BattlePetError enumeration value that specifies the type of error
      to send to the client. This defines what kind of battle pet related issue occurred.
  - name: creatureId
    description: An integer identifier representing the creature or pet involved in
      the error condition. This ID is used by the client to reference the specific
      battle pet that caused or was affected by the error.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a generic battle pet error
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* mgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      mgr->SendError(BATTLE_PET_ERROR_INVALID_CREATURE, 12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling a failed pet summon operation
    code: "if (!CanSummonPet(player, petEntry)) {\n    BattlePetMgr* mgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();\n\
      \    mgr->SendError(BATTLE_PET_ERROR_SUMMON_FAILED, petEntry);\n    return false;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battle pet system integration in TrinityCore and
    likely sends a specific opcode to the client for displaying error messages. The
    creatureId parameter should correspond to a valid battle pet entry or GUID within
    the game's creature database. It is recommended to validate the error type and
    creature ID before calling this method to ensure proper client behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the BattlePetMgr
    or with invalid parameters may result in undefined behavior or client-side errors.
    Ensure that the player has an active battle pet session before sending error messages,
    as sending errors outside of valid contexts might confuse the client or cause
    UI glitches.
