documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the group combat trigger condition and returns a priority value
    for bot AI decision making.
  description: The GroupCombatTrigger::Evaluate method assesses whether the current
    group is engaged in combat and determines the appropriate priority level for the
    bot AI to respond. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore bot AI
    system to evaluate combat scenarios and make decisions about engagement, retreat,
    or support actions. The evaluation considers factors such as group member health
    status, enemy proximity, and overall combat state. It returns an integer value
    representing the priority level (higher values indicate higher priority) that
    the AI should use when processing this trigger.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the priority level for the group
    combat trigger. Higher values indicate higher priority for immediate action, while
    lower or negative values suggest the trigger should be ignored or processed with
    low priority. A return value of 0 typically indicates no active combat condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "int priority = groupCombatTrigger.Evaluate(ai);\nif (priority > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Execute combat-related actions based on priority\n    ai->SetCurrentAction(PRIORITY_HIGH);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot AI Combat Logic
    code: "class MyBotAI : public BotAI\n{\npublic:\n    int EvaluateCombatTriggers()\n\
      \    {\n        GroupCombatTrigger trigger;\n        int priority = trigger.Evaluate(this);\n\
      \        \n        if (priority > 50)\n            return ACTION_ENGAGE;\n \
      \       else if (priority > 20)\n            return ACTION_SUPPORT;\n      \
      \  else\n            return ACTION_WAIT;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore bot AI framework and should only be
    called from within the context of a BotAI instance. The evaluation logic may vary
    depending on the specific group composition and combat situation. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this is a simple evaluation method, but it's called
    frequently during AI decision cycles.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI parameter passed to this method is valid and initialized
    before calling Evaluate. Calling Evaluate with a null or uninitialized BotAI pointer
    will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes proper
    group state management by the calling code.
