documentation:
  brief: Checks if a target unit is engaged in combat with any other units besides
    the owner of the scanner.
  description: The IsTargetInCombatWithOthers method determines whether a specified
    target unit is currently in combat with any other units, excluding the unit that
    owns or initiated the scanner. This functionality is commonly used in AI decision-making
    processes to assess threat levels and determine appropriate actions such as prioritizing
    targets or avoiding engagement. The method evaluates the combat state of the target
    by checking its current combat status against other units within its vicinity.
    It does not consider the scanner's own combat state, only the target's interactions
    with others.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is in combat with any other units besides
    the scanner's owner; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check target engagement
    code: "if (scanner.IsTargetInCombatWithOthers(targetUnit)) {\n    // Target is\
      \ fighting other enemies\n    DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI logic for threat assessment
    code: "if (!scanner.IsTargetInCombatWithOthers(targetUnit) && targetUnit->IsInCombat())\
      \ {\n    // Target is alone and in combat - prioritize this target\n    ai->SetCurrentTarget(targetUnit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal unit combat tracking mechanisms within TrinityCore.
    It may not account for very recent combat state changes or edge cases involving
    multiple simultaneous engagements. The method is typically used in conjunction
    with other combat-related APIs to build comprehensive AI behavior logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer passed to this method is valid and
    not null, as accessing an invalid unit could lead to undefined behavior. This
    method should be called only when the scanner and target are in a valid state
    for combat evaluation.
