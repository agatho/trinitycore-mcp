  class: MonkAI
  method: HandleMobilityAbilities
  signature: void MonkAI::HandleMobilityAbilities(int * target, const int & optimalPos)
documentation:
  brief: Processes mobility-related abilities for a monk AI unit based on target and
    optimal position.
  description: The HandleMobilityAbilities method in the MonkAI class manages the
    execution of mobility-based skills such as leap, dodge, or other movement-enhancing
    abilities. It evaluates the current target and determines whether a mobility ability
    should be cast based on distance, positioning, and combat state. This method is
    typically invoked during AI decision-making cycles to optimize the monk's positioning
    and escape capabilities in combat scenarios. The method modifies internal AI state
    and may trigger ability casting or movement actions depending on game conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      Used to determine if mobility abilities should be activated based on threat
      or positioning.
  - name: optimalPos
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the optimal position for the monk
      to move towards. This value is used in conjunction with the target to calculate
      movement behavior and ability activation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleMobilityAbilities
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      int optimalPosition = 500;

      monkAI->HandleMobilityAbilities(&targetId, optimalPosition);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n        int\
      \ targetId = me->GetVictim() ? me->GetVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue() : 0;\n\
      \        int optimalPos = CalculateOptimalPosition();\n        HandleMobilityAbilities(&targetId,\
      \ optimalPos);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI behavior system for monk units in TrinityCore.
    It assumes that the target and position values are valid and within expected ranges.
    The actual casting or movement logic may depend on cooldowns, resource availability,
    and current game state.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target pointer or invalid optimalPos values can
    lead to undefined behavior or AI malfunction. Ensure that the target unit exists
    and is accessible before calling this method.
