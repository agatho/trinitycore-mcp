  class: HunterAI
  method: HandleDefensives
  signature: bool HunterAI::HandleDefensives(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles defensive actions for the hunter AI, determining whether to use defensive
    abilities based on current combat state.
  description: The HandleDefensives method is responsible for managing defensive behaviors
    within the HunterAI class. It evaluates the hunter's current health, threat level,
    and available defensive abilities to decide whether to activate defensive measures
    such as Feign Death or Misdirection. This method typically gets called during
    combat updates and helps ensure that the hunter prioritizes survival when necessary.
    The method returns true if a defensive action was successfully initiated or false
    if no appropriate defensive ability was available or applicable.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current target's ID or index.
      This parameter is used to determine if the hunter should use defensive abilities
      against the specified target.
  returns: Returns true if a defensive ability was successfully activated, false otherwise.
    The method may return false if no defensive actions are available, the hunter
    is not in combat, or the conditions for using a defensive ability are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat update
    code: "if (hunterAI->HandleDefensives(&targetId)) {\n    // Defensive action was\
      \ taken\n    return;\n}\n// Continue with normal AI logic"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom hunter AI loop
    code: "void CustomHunterAIFunction() {\n    int currentTarget = GetTargetId();\n\
      \    if (HandleDefensives(&currentTarget)) {\n        // Defensive action handled,\
      \ skip other actions\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with regular hunting\
      \ behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI logic and should be called regularly during
    combat updates to ensure proper defensive behavior. The target parameter must
    point to a valid target ID or index; otherwise, the behavior may be unpredictable.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    target. Passing an invalid or uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior.
    Also note that this method does not directly modify the hunter's health or status
    but rather decides whether defensive actions should be taken.
