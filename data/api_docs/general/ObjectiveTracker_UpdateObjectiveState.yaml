  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: UpdateObjectiveState
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::UpdateObjectiveState(Player * bot, const ObjectiveState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the objective state for a specified player in the objective tracker
    system.
  description: The UpdateObjectiveState method is responsible for updating the current
    state of an objective associated with a specific player within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method is typically used by the game's quest and objective tracking
    systems to synchronize the player's progress with the server-side state. It ensures
    that any changes to objectives, such as progress updates or completion status,
    are properly recorded and propagated through the system. The method operates on
    a Player object and applies the provided ObjectiveState, which contains the updated
    information about the objective's current status.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose objective state is being updated.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid player instance
      in the game world.
  - name: state
    description: The new ObjectiveState object containing the updated information
      about the objective's progress, completion status, or other relevant data. This
      parameter defines how the objective should be reflected in the tracker.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get a valid player instance

      ObjectiveState newState;

      newState.progress = 50;

      newState.isCompleted = false;

      objectiveTracker->UpdateObjectiveState(player, newState);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Completed Objective
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get a valid player instance

      ObjectiveState completedState;

      completedState.progress = 100;

      completedState.isCompleted = true;

      objectiveTracker->UpdateObjectiveState(player, completedState);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game's quest system when
    a player makes progress on an objective. The implementation may involve updating
    database records, sending updates to the client, and potentially triggering related
    events or callbacks. It's important to ensure that the Player object passed in
    is valid and currently logged in to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'bot' parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Always validate that the player exists and is in a valid
    state before calling this method. Additionally, frequent calls to this method
    without proper throttling may impact performance.
