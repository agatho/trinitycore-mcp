documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the summon list contains no summons
  description: The empty() method determines if the SummonList is currently holding
    any summoned creatures or game objects. It returns true if there are no summons
    in the list, and false if there are one or more summons present. This method is
    commonly used to verify the state of a summon list before attempting operations
    that require an empty container, such as adding new summons or performing cleanup
    operations. In World of Warcraft context, this is particularly useful when managing
    creature summons, pet summons, or any summoned game objects within a creature's
    AI behavior or spell effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the summon list contains no summons, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Check if summon list is empty before adding summons
    code: "if (summonList.empty()) {\n    // Safe to add new summons\n    Creature*\
      \ summoned = me->SummonCreature(12345, position, TEMPSUMMON_MANUAL_DESPAWN);\n\
      \    summonList.AddSummons(summoned);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in cleanup routine to ensure no summons remain
    code: "void CleanupSummons() {\n    if (!summonList.empty()) {\n        // Despawn\
      \ all summons\n        summonList.DespawnAll();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method has O(1) time complexity as it typically just checks an internal
    counter or flag rather than iterating through the list. The implementation relies
    on the underlying container's empty() method, which is efficient for standard
    containers like std::vector or std::list.
