  class: WorldObject
  method: GetVisibilityRange
  signature: float WorldObject::GetVisibilityRange() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the visibility range of the WorldObject, determining
    how far other objects can see it.
  description: The GetVisibilityRange method computes the maximum distance at which
    a WorldObject (such as a player, creature, or game object) can be seen by other
    objects in the game world. This value is used internally by the server to determine
    which objects should be visible to players within their field of view. The visibility
    range may vary based on the type of object, its state (e.g., stealth, invisibility),
    and environmental factors like fog of war or line of sight. For players, this
    typically corresponds to the standard client visibility distance unless modified
    by special conditions or game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the visibility range in yards. This is a positive
    floating-point number that indicates how far away other objects can detect and
    see this WorldObject.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Visibility Range
    code: 'float range = player->GetVisibilityRange();

      // range now contains the visibility distance of the player in yards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Visibility Range for Object Culling
    code: "WorldObject* obj = ...;\nfloat visibilityRange = obj->GetVisibilityRange();\n\
      if (obj->IsWithinDist(player, visibilityRange)) {\n    // Object is within visibility\
      \ range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be overridden in derived classes such as Player or Creature
    to provide custom visibility logic. The returned value does not account for line
    of sight obstructions; it represents the maximum theoretical visibility distance.
