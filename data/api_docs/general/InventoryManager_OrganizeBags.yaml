documentation:
  brief: Reorganizes the player's inventory bags to optimize item placement and free
    up space.
  description: The OrganizeBags method in the InventoryManager class automatically
    reorganizes all items within a player's inventory bags. It attempts to consolidate
    stacks, move items to more optimal slots, and free up empty bag slots by moving
    items from full bags to others. This functionality is typically triggered when
    a player interacts with their inventory or when certain game events occur that
    require inventory optimization. The method ensures that items are arranged in
    an efficient manner for gameplay convenience without changing the actual item
    contents or quantities.

    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      InventoryManager* inventory = player->GetSession()->GetInventory();

      inventory->OrganizeBags();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger inventory update events that could affect UI display.
    It operates on the player's current bag contents and does not modify item properties
    or attributes. The reorganization process respects item stacking limits and bag
    slot restrictions.
