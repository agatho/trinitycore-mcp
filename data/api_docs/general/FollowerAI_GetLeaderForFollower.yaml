  class: FollowerAI
  method: GetLeaderForFollower
  signature: int * FollowerAI::GetLeaderForFollower()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the GUID of the player who is leading this follower
    unit.
  description: The GetLeaderForFollower method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the player that is currently leading this follower unit. This method is typically
    used in the context of creature AI systems where NPCs follow players, such as
    companions or quest-related followers. The returned pointer points to an integer
    value representing the GUID of the leader. If no leader is assigned or if the
    follower is not currently following anyone, the method may return a null pointer
    or a default value indicating no valid leader exists. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining proper AI behavior and tracking relationships between player characters
    and their summoned or following creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the player who is leading
    this follower, or NULL if no valid leader is assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a follower has a leader
    code: "FollowerAI* follower = ...;\nint* leaderGuid = follower->GetLeaderForFollower();\n\
      if (leaderGuid != nullptr)\n{\n    // A leader exists, use *leaderGuid to access\
      \ the GUID\n    uint64 leaderGUID = *leaderGuid;\n    // Process the leader's\
      \ GUID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No leader assigned\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the returned GUID to verify follower-leader relationship
    code: "FollowerAI* follower = ...;\nint* leaderGuid = follower->GetLeaderForFollower();\n\
      if (leaderGuid != nullptr && *leaderGuid > 0)\n{\n    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ *leaderGuid));\n    if (player && player->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        //\
      \ The follower is currently following a valid player\n        // Perform actions\
      \ based on this relationship\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FollowerAI instance has been properly initialized
    and that the follower unit's leader information is maintained by the AI system.
    The returned pointer should not be modified directly as it points to internal
    data structures managed by the AI system. It's recommended to copy the value pointed
    to rather than using the pointer directly in long-term operations.
  warnings: The method may return NULL if no valid leader is assigned, so always check
    for null before dereferencing the returned pointer. Dereferencing a null pointer
    will cause undefined behavior and likely crash the server. Additionally, since
    this returns a raw pointer to an internal GUID value, be cautious about using
    it in multi-threaded environments where the leader might change during execution.
