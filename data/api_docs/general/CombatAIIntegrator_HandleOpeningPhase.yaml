  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::HandleOpeningPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and executes the opening phase of combat for a creature's AI
    behavior.
  description: The HandleOpeningPhase method is responsible for managing the initial
    actions and logic that occur when a creature enters combat. This typically includes
    setting up initial threat, selecting target, performing opening abilities or spells,
    and preparing the AI state for ongoing combat engagement. The method is part of
    the CombatAIIntegrator class which orchestrates various aspects of AI-driven combat
    behavior in TrinityCore. It ensures proper initialization of combat-related flags
    and states before transitioning into regular combat routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI Integration
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::EnterCombat(Unit* who)\n{\n    // Call the opening phase\
      \ handler\n    m_combatAIIntegrator->HandleOpeningPhase();\n    \n    // Continue\
      \ with regular combat logic\n    StartCombat(who);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the EnterCombat event and should be
    invoked before any other combat-related AI logic. The implementation may vary
    depending on the specific creature type and its assigned AI script. It's important
    to ensure that all necessary combat state variables are properly initialized before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context as it assumes certain
    preconditions like active combat state and valid target. Calling this method multiple
    times without proper reset can lead to undefined behavior in AI state management.
