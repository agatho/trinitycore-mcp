  class: MovementArbiter
  method: GetPendingRequestCount
  signature: uint32 MovementArbiter::GetPendingRequestCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of pending movement requests in the arbiter's queue.
  description: The GetPendingRequestCount method retrieves the current count of movement
    requests that are awaiting processing within the MovementArbiter. This value represents
    how many movement commands have been submitted but not yet executed or acknowledged
    by the system. The method is typically used for monitoring and debugging purposes
    to understand the load on the movement handling system, particularly in scenarios
    involving multiple concurrent player movements or AI-controlled entities. It provides
    insight into potential bottlenecks or delays in movement processing without modifying
    any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of pending movement requests
    currently queued for processing within the MovementArbiter instance.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Pending Movement Requests
    code: "uint32 pendingCount = arbiter->GetPendingRequestCount();\nif (pendingCount\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"High movement request backlog:\
      \ %u\", pendingCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state of the
    MovementArbiter. It provides a snapshot of the current queue size at the time
    of invocation, which may change immediately after the call.
