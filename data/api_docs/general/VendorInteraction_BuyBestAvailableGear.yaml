api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: BuyBestAvailableGear
  signature: void VendorInteraction::BuyBestAvailableGear(Player * player, uint32
    vendorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Purchases the best available gear from a vendor for the specified player.
  description: The BuyBestAvailableGear method automates the process of purchasing
    optimal equipment from a vendor based on the player's current level, class, and
    inventory needs. It evaluates available items in the vendor's inventory, prioritizes
    those that are beneficial for the player's progression, and executes the purchase.
    This method is typically used in automated systems or scripts to streamline gear
    acquisition without manual intervention. The method assumes the player is within
    interaction range of the vendor and has sufficient currency to complete the transaction.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom gear will be purchased. Must
      be a valid player instance with an active session.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor from which gear is to
      be purchased. Must correspond to a valid NPC in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 vendorGuid = 12345;

      VendorInteraction interaction;

      interaction.BuyBestAvailableGear(player, vendorGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 vendorGuid = 12345;\nVendorInteraction interaction;\n\
      if (player && player->IsInWorld()) {\n    interaction.BuyBestAvailableGear(player,\
      \ vendorGuid);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid player or out-of-world state\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally uses the player's current gear evaluation logic to
    determine which items are best suited for their class and level. It may not always
    purchase the highest-level item available, but rather the most beneficial one
    based on game progression mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the vendor GUID corresponds to a valid NPC and that the player
    is within interaction range. Improper usage can lead to invalid transactions or
    errors if currency checks fail.
