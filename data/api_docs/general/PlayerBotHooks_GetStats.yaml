  method: GetStats
  signature: HookStatistics & PlayerBotHooks::GetStats()
documentation:
  brief: Returns reference to statistics structure containing hook execution metrics
    for player bot operations.
  description: The GetStats method provides access to a HookStatistics object that
    tracks various performance and usage metrics related to the PlayerBotHooks system.
    This includes data such as total hooks executed, average execution time, error
    counts, and other diagnostic information. The returned reference allows direct
    modification of statistics, making it useful for monitoring bot behavior and performance
    tuning within TrinityCore's player bot framework. The method is typically used
    by internal systems or debugging tools to analyze how frequently and efficiently
    hook functions are being invoked during player bot operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to a HookStatistics object containing detailed metrics about
    hook execution including counts, timing data, and error statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Hook Statistics
    code: 'HookStatistics& stats = playerBotHooks.GetStats();

      uint32 totalHooks = stats.totalHooksExecuted;

      uint32 errorCount = stats.errorCount;

      printf("Total hooks: %u, Errors: %u\n", totalHooks, errorCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Bot Performance
    code: "HookStatistics& stats = playerBotHooks.GetStats();\nif (stats.totalHooksExecuted\
      \ > 1000)\n{\n    float avgTime = static_cast<float>(stats.totalExecutionTime)\
      \ / stats.totalHooksExecuted;\n    printf(\"Average hook execution time: %.4f\
      \ ms\\n\", avgTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The HookStatistics object returned is a live reference to internal data structures,
    so modifications made directly to it will affect the actual statistics tracking.
    This method should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as accessing
    and modifying these stats may have minor overhead. The statistics are maintained
    per-player-bot instance and reset periodically based on system configuration.
  warnings: Direct modification of the returned HookStatistics reference can lead
    to inconsistent state if not handled properly. Avoid modifying statistics during
    active hook execution to prevent race conditions. The statistics object should
    only be accessed from threads that have appropriate synchronization with the player
    bot subsystem.
