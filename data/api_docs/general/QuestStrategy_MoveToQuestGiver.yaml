  class: QuestStrategy
  method: MoveToQuestGiver
  signature: bool QuestStrategy::MoveToQuestGiver(BotAI * ai, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the bot to the quest giver for a specified quest.
  description: The MoveToQuestGiver method instructs the AI bot to navigate to the
    quest giver associated with the provided quest ID. This method is typically used
    in questing strategies to ensure the bot moves to the correct location to accept
    or turn in quests. It handles pathfinding and movement logic internally, ensuring
    the bot reaches the quest giver's position. The method returns true if the movement
    was successfully initiated, and false if it fails due to invalid quest ID, missing
    quest giver, or other navigation issues.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the bot's behavior.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the bot should move to the
      quest giver.
  returns: True if the bot successfully begins movement toward the quest giver; false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MoveToQuestGiver
    code: "if (strategy->MoveToQuestGiver(ai, 12345)) {\n    ai->TellPlayer(\"Moving\
      \ to quest giver.\");\n} else {\n    ai->TellPlayer(\"Failed to move to quest\
      \ giver.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's pathfinding system and requires that the quest
    giver is properly registered in the game world. The bot must be able to reach
    the quest giver's location for the movement to succeed.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest ID passed is valid, otherwise the method will fail
    silently or return false. Also, this method does not wait for completion; it only
    initiates the movement.
