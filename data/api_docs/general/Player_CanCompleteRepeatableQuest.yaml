  signature: bool Player::CanCompleteRepeatableQuest(const Quest * quest)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can complete a repeatable quest based on quest
    requirements and player state.
  description: This method checks if a player is eligible to complete a repeatable
    quest, considering factors such as quest completion status, player level, quest
    prerequisites, and quest requirements. It evaluates whether the player has met
    all necessary conditions to accept the quest reward and advance the quest progress.
    The method returns true if the player can complete the quest, false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining game balance and ensuring proper
    quest progression mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can complete the repeatable quest, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that the player either lacks the required prerequisites
    or has already completed the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Check
    code: "if (player->CanCompleteRepeatableQuest(quest)) {\n    // Player can complete\
      \ the quest\n    player->CompleteQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    // Player cannot\
      \ complete the quest\n    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    like Quest::GetQuestLevel() and Player::GetQuestStatus() to determine overall
    quest eligibility. The implementation involves checking player's quest log status,
    level requirements, and quest completion state.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for quest completion without verifying
    the player's actual quest status. It is primarily a validation method that checks
    whether conditions are met for quest completion.
