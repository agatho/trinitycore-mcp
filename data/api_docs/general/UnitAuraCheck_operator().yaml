  class: UnitAuraCheck
  method: operator()
  signature: bool UnitAuraCheck::operator()(int * object) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a unit has a specific aura and returns true if the aura is present.
  description: The UnitAuraCheck::operator() method performs a validation check to
    determine whether a specified aura is currently active on a unit. This method
    is typically used within aura-based conditions or filters in TrinityCore's AI
    and spell systems. It takes an integer pointer as input, which likely represents
    the aura ID or index to be checked. The method returns true if the aura is found
    on the unit, and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for implementing
    conditional logic in spells, abilities, or AI behaviors that depend on the presence
    or absence of specific auras.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the aura ID or index to be checked
      on the unit. The value pointed to should correspond to a valid aura identifier
      within the game's aura system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified aura is currently active on the unit, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the aura has expired, was
    removed, or was never applied to the unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Check
    code: "UnitAuraCheck auraCheck;\nint auraId = 12345;\nbool hasAura = auraCheck(&auraId);\n\
      if (hasAura) {\n    // Perform action if aura is present\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Spell Condition
    code: "if (unit->HasAura(12345)) {\n    // Apply effect only if aura exists\n\
      \    unit->CastSpell(target, 67890, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with TrinityCore's aura management
    system. It assumes that the Unit object is valid and accessible. The integer parameter
    should represent a valid aura ID from the game's database or spell definitions.
  warnings: Ensure that the unit being checked is not null before calling this method.
    Passing an invalid aura ID may result in undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    The method does not perform any automatic cleanup or validation of the aura state.
