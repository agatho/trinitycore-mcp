  signature: uint32 AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetActiveStrategies() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bitmask of currently active AI strategies for the adaptive
    behavior manager.
  description: The GetActiveStrategies method returns a uint32 value representing
    a bitmask of all currently active AI strategies within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
    This bitmask is used by the TrinityCore AI system to determine which behaviors
    are currently enabled for an NPC or creature. Each bit in the returned value corresponds
    to a specific strategy type, allowing for efficient activation and deactivation
    of different AI behaviors at runtime. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is purely informational, making it safe to call during AI decision-making
    processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 bitmask where each bit represents the activation status of a specific
    AI strategy. Bit positions correspond to predefined strategy constants (e.g.,
    STRATEGY_COMBAT = 1, STRATEGY_MOVEMENT = 2, etc.). A set bit indicates that the
    corresponding strategy is currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Check if combat strategy is active
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = unit->GetAI()->GetBehaviorManager();\n\
      uint32 activeStrategies = behaviorMgr->GetActiveStrategies();\nif (activeStrategies\
      \ & STRATEGY_COMBAT)\n{\n    // Combat strategy is currently active\n    //\
      \ Perform combat-related logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Log all active strategies
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = unit->GetAI()->GetBehaviorManager();\n\
      uint32 activeStrategies = behaviorMgr->GetActiveStrategies();\nTC_LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      ai\", \"Active strategies bitmask: %u\", activeStrategies);\n\n// Iterate through\
      \ all possible strategy bits to identify which ones are set\nfor (int i = 0;\
      \ i < 32; ++i)\n{\n    if (activeStrategies & (1 << i))\n    {\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      ai\", \"Strategy %d is active\", i);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of the current AI strategy state at the time
    of invocation. The returned bitmask should not be modified directly as it represents
    the internal state of the behavior manager. The implementation uses bitwise operations
    for performance, making it very fast to execute even in high-frequency AI decision
    loops.
  warnings: The returned bitmask may change between calls if other methods modify
    the active strategies (such as ActivateStrategy or DeactivateStrategy). Always
    assume that the bitmask reflects the current state at the time of calling this
    method. Do not cache the result for extended periods without re-checking.
