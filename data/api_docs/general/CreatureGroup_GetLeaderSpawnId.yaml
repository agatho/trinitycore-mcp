  method: GetLeaderSpawnId
  signature: int CreatureGroup::GetLeaderSpawnId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spawn ID of the creature group leader.
  description: The GetLeaderSpawnId method retrieves the unique spawn identifier associated
    with the leader creature in a creature group. This spawn ID is used internally
    by TrinityCore to track and manage the specific instance of the leader creature
    within the world. The returned value typically corresponds to the SpawnId field
    from the creature's database entry, which distinguishes it from other instances
    of the same creature template. This method is commonly used during group behavior
    logic, such as when determining the leader's position or state for group movement
    and AI decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the spawn ID of the creature group leader. A value
    of 0 typically indicates that no valid leader exists or the group has not been
    properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Leader Spawn ID
    code: "CreatureGroup* group = ...; // Assume group is already initialized\nint\
      \ leaderSpawnId = group->GetLeaderSpawnId();\nif (leaderSpawnId > 0)\n{\n  \
      \  // Process valid leader spawn ID\n    printf(\"Leader spawn ID: %d\\n\",\
      \ leaderSpawnId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid or missing leader\n   \
      \ printf(\"No valid leader found in group.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the creature group has been properly initialized
    with a valid leader. If called on an uninitialized or malformed group, it may
    return unexpected values. The spawn ID returned is not necessarily the same as
    the creature's GUID, but rather its database spawn identifier.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value guarantees the leader creature
    is alive or active. The spawn ID might be valid even if the actual creature has
    been despawned or removed from the world.
