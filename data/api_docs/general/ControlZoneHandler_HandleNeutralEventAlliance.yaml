  method: HandleNeutralEventAlliance
  signature: void ControlZoneHandler::HandleNeutralEventAlliance(GameObject * controlZone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when an Alliance player interacts with a neutral control
    zone object.
  description: The HandleNeutralEventAlliance method is responsible for processing
    interactions between Alliance players and neutral control zones within the World
    of Warcraft game environment. This function typically manages the logic associated
    with capturing or influencing a control zone that is currently neutral, such as
    updating faction ownership, triggering quest events, or modifying the zone's state.
    The method operates on a GameObject parameter representing the specific control
    zone being interacted with, and it ensures proper synchronization of game state
    changes for Alliance players. This handler is part of the broader ControlZoneHandler
    system which manages all interactions related to contested territorial objects
    in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: controlZone
    description: A pointer to the GameObject representing the neutral control zone
      being interacted with. This object must be a valid control zone type that supports
      Alliance interactions, typically containing faction-specific data and event
      handlers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void SomePlayerHandler(Player* player, GameObject* zone)\n{\n    ControlZoneHandler\
      \ handler;\n    handler.HandleNeutralEventAlliance(zone);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Interaction System
    code: "void Player::OnGameObjectUse(GameObject* go)\n{\n    if (go->GetGOInfo()->type\
      \ == GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_CONTROL_ZONE)\n    {\n        if (GetTeam() == ALLIANCE)\n\
      \        {\n            ControlZoneHandler::HandleNeutralEventAlliance(go);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player's team is Alliance and
    the control zone is in a neutral state. The GameObject parameter must not be null
    and should represent a valid control zone type. Implementation assumes proper
    synchronization of game state changes across the server.
  warnings: Calling this method with a non-neutral control zone or a GameObject that
    is not a control zone may result in undefined behavior or server crashes. Ensure
    that all preconditions are met before invoking this handler to prevent inconsistent
    game state.
