  class: GossipMenu
  method: GetMenuItemCount
  signature: uint32 GossipMenu::GetMenuItemCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of menu items in the gossip menu.
  description: The GetMenuItemCount method retrieves the current count of menu items
    added to a GossipMenu instance. This is useful for determining how many options
    are available in a dialogue menu before processing or iterating through them.
    The method does not take any parameters and returns a uint32 value representing
    the number of items. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method
    is commonly used when building dynamic NPC gossip menus where the number of options
    may vary based on player state, quest progress, or other conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of menu items currently in
    the gossip menu. Returns 0 if no items have been added to the menu.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Menu Size
    code: "void CheckGossipMenuSize(Player* player, GossipMenu* menu)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ itemCount = menu->GetMenuItemCount();\n    if (itemCount > 0)\n    {\n   \
      \     // Process menu items\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"player.gossip\", \"Gossip\
      \ menu contains %u items.\", itemCount);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      player.gossip\", \"Gossip menu is empty.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through Menu Items
    code: "void DisplayAllMenuItems(Player* player, GossipMenu* menu)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ count = menu->GetMenuItemCount();\n    for (uint32 i = 0; i < count; ++i)\n\
      \    {\n        // Access each item by index\n        // Note: Actual access\
      \ would require additional methods like GetMenuItem\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      player.gossip\", \"Menu item %u exists in the menu.\", i + 1);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a quick way to determine the size of a gossip menu without
    needing to iterate through all items. It's particularly useful for conditional
    logic where the presence or absence of menu options affects gameplay behavior.
    The implementation is typically O(1) in complexity since it usually just returns
    a cached count value.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned count only reflects items added via AddMenuItem
    calls and does not include any automatically generated items such as quest options
    or default responses. If you're modifying the menu during gossip handling, ensure
    to call this method after all modifications are complete to get an accurate count.
