documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InterruptRotationManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the InterruptRotationManager class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the manager.
    This method is automatically invoked when an InterruptRotationManager object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system,
    this class likely manages interruptible spell rotations for NPCs or players, ensuring
    proper cleanup of rotation states and associated data structures upon destruction.
    The destructor ensures no memory leaks occur and that all internal state is properly
    reset.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager* manager = new InterruptRotationManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~InterruptRotationManager()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Scope Cleanup
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    InterruptRotationManager manager;\n    // ...\
      \ use manager ...\n} // ~InterruptRotationManager() automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It's important to ensure that all references to the manager are cleared
    before destruction to prevent dangling pointers. In TrinityCore, this class likely
    interacts with AI state machines and may need to unregister itself from any active
    rotation queues or callbacks.
  warnings: Never manually invoke the destructor unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. The destructor assumes all internal resources have been properly
    initialized and should not be called on partially constructed objects. Improper
    use can lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks.
