  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: CageBattlePet
  signature: void BattlePetMgr::CageBattlePet(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Cages a battle pet with the specified GUID, removing it from the active battle
    and storing it in the player's collection.
  description: The CageBattlePet method is responsible for capturing a battle pet
    that is currently in combat and moving it to the player's collection. This action
    typically occurs when a player wins a battle involving a wild or captured pet.
    The method takes a GUID parameter which identifies the specific battle pet to
    be caged. It updates the pet's status from being in battle to being stored in
    the player's pet journal, ensuring that the pet is no longer available for use
    in active battles. This functionality is part of the Battle Pet system introduced
    in World of Warcraft's Battle for Azeroth expansion and is essential for managing
    a player's collection of pets.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet to be caged. This
      value must correspond to an existing battle pet in the current battle context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Cage a Battle Pet by GUID
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petManager = player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      uint32 petGuid = 123456;

      petManager->CageBattlePet(petGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a battle is active and the specified
    pet is currently participating in that battle. The GUID parameter must be validated
    to ensure it refers to a valid battle pet before calling this method. Implementation
    may involve updating database records, modifying player data structures, and potentially
    triggering UI updates.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID can result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the pet is actually in battle before
    attempting to cage it. This method should not be called outside of a valid battle
    context.
