documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all abilities and spells used by the guardian
    druid.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking system for a Guardian Druid AI. This method ensures
    that all applicable abilities, including both player and pet actions, are properly
    checked against their current cooldown timers. It typically runs during each AI
    update cycle to maintain accurate state information, preventing abilities from
    being used before their cooldown periods have expired. The implementation likely
    iterates through the druid's available spells and abilities, checking their individual
    cooldown status and updating internal tracking variables accordingly.

    code: "void GuardianDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateCooldownStates();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the regular AI update cycle and
    should not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom behavior.
    It's important to note that cooldown states may affect spell selection logic in
    the AI decision-making process.
