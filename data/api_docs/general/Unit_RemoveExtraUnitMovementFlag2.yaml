  method: RemoveExtraUnitMovementFlag2
  signature: void Unit::RemoveExtraUnitMovementFlag2(uint32 f)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific movement flag from the unit's movement flags.
  description: This method removes a specified extra movement flag from the Unit's
    movement flags, effectively disabling or clearing that particular flag. It is
    used in conjunction with other movement-related methods to control how units move
    within the game world. The method operates on the unit's internal movement flag
    state and may affect various movement behaviors including running, swimming, or
    flying depending on the flag being removed.
  parameters:
  - name: f
    description: The movement flag to be removed from the unit's movement flags. This
      parameter specifies which flag should be cleared, typically representing a specific
      movement type such as running, swimming, or flying.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Movement Flag Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->RemoveExtraUnitMovementFlag2(MOVEMENT_FLAG_RUNNING);

      // This removes the running movement flag from the unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement flag manipulation
    methods to ensure proper control over unit movement behavior. It should be used
    carefully as removing flags may affect how units interact with the game world.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected movement behaviors
    or even crashes if used incorrectly. Ensure that the flag being removed is valid
    and corresponds to an actual movement type in the game.
