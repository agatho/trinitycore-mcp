  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: GeneratePerformanceReport
  signature: std::string PerformanceOptimizer::GeneratePerformanceReport(uint32_t
    botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a performance report for the specified bot GUID.
  description: The GeneratePerformanceReport method creates a detailed performance
    analysis report for a specific bot identified by its unique GUID. This method
    is typically used in TrinityCore's AI and performance monitoring systems to evaluate
    bot behavior, resource usage, and overall system efficiency. The generated report
    includes metrics such as processing time, memory consumption, and other relevant
    performance indicators. The method operates on the assumption that the bot exists
    within the system and has been properly initialized for performance tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to generate the
      performance report. This value must correspond to an existing bot in the system.
  returns: A std::string containing the formatted performance report for the specified
    bot. The string includes detailed metrics and analysis related to the bot's performance
    characteristics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      std::string report = optimizer.GeneratePerformanceReport(botGuid);

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Performance Report: %s", report.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve significant computational overhead depending on the
    amount of data being collected for the performance analysis. It should be used
    judiciously in performance-critical sections of code. The method assumes that
    the bot GUID provided is valid and corresponds to an active bot within the system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or exceptions. Ensure proper validation of the bot GUID
    before invoking this method. Avoid calling this method frequently in tight loops
    as it may impact overall system performance.
