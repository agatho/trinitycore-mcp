  method: ResetTicks
  signature: void AuraEffect::ResetTicks()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the tick counter for the aura effect, preparing it for new tick calculations.
  description: The ResetTicks method resets the internal tick counter of an AuraEffect
    instance, typically used when an aura is refreshed or re-applied. This ensures
    that the aura's periodic effects start their tick cycle anew from the beginning.
    The method is commonly invoked during aura application, refresh, or modification
    scenarios to maintain proper tick timing and prevent incorrect execution of periodic
    effects. It does not alter the aura's duration or other properties, only resets
    the tick tracking mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting ticks when refreshing an aura
    code: "AuraEffect* auraEffect = player->GetAuraEffect(12345, 0);\nif (auraEffect)\n\
      {\n    auraEffect->ResetTicks();\n    // Aura will now restart its tick counter\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the aura effect is being re-applied
    or refreshed. Calling it at inappropriate times may cause unexpected behavior
    in periodic effects that rely on tick counting.
