  method: PlanOptimalTurnInRoute
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::PlanOptimalTurnInRoute(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Plans the optimal turn-in route for a bot player to complete quests efficiently.
  description: The PlanOptimalTurnInRoute method determines the most efficient path
    for a bot player to turn in quests based on quest requirements, NPC locations,
    and inventory state. It analyzes available quest objectives, identifies optimal
    quest givers, and calculates the shortest travel route to maximize quest completion
    speed. This method is typically used in AI-driven bot systems within TrinityCore
    to automate quest progression for automated players. The method modifies internal
    state variables of the QuestTurnIn class to store the computed route information.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the turn-in route. Must be a valid player instance with quest data loaded.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PlanOptimalTurnInRoute
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      questTurnIn.PlanOptimalTurnInRoute(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot's quest data is properly initialized and
    that the player object has valid quest state information. The actual route planning
    algorithm may consider factors such as travel distance, quest dependencies, and
    available quest givers in the current zone.
  warnings: Calling this method on a bot without proper quest initialization may result
    in incorrect or empty routing decisions. Ensure that all relevant quest data is
    loaded before invoking this method.
