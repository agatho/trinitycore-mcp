documentation:
  brief: Logs the completion status of a trade operation to the game's logging system.
  description: The LogTradeCompletion method records whether a trade between two players
    was successfully completed or failed. This method is typically invoked after a
    trade transaction has been processed to maintain game integrity and provide audit
    trails for debugging and monitoring purposes. It ensures that all trade activities
    are properly logged in the server's database or log files, which can be used for
    tracking player behavior, detecting exploits, or resolving disputes. The method
    does not perform any validation of the trade itself but simply logs the outcome
    of the operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Trade Completion Handler
    code: "void OnTradeComplete(Player* player1, Player* player2, bool success)\n\
      {\n    TradeManager::LogTradeCompletion(success);\n    // Additional trade logic\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Trade Result Processing
    code: "void ProcessTradeResult(TradeData* tradeData, bool isSuccessful)\n{\n \
      \   if (isSuccessful)\n    {\n        // Execute trade completion logic\n  \
      \      tradeData->CompleteTrade();\n        TradeManager::LogTradeCompletion(true);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle failed trade\n        tradeData->CancelTrade();\n\
      \        TradeManager::LogTradeCompletion(false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger trade management system and may interact
    with database logging or event systems. It's designed to be lightweight and should
    not block the main game thread. The actual logging mechanism (file, database,
    or console) depends on the server configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called after a trade operation has been
    fully processed to avoid logging incorrect states. Calling it prematurely may
    result in misleading logs that could complicate debugging efforts.
