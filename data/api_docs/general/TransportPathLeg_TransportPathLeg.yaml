documentation:
  brief: Moves a TransportPathLeg object, transferring ownership of its resources
    to the new instance.
  description: The TransportPathLeg move constructor transfers all resources from
    the source TransportPathLeg object to the newly created instance. This operation
    is typically used when moving objects between containers or when passing them
    as arguments to functions. The source object becomes invalid after the move and
    should not be used. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method
    is likely used for efficient handling of transport path data structures during
    movement calculations and NPC/creature transport systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Construction
    code: 'TransportPathLeg sourceLeg;

      // ... populate sourceLeg with data ...

      TransportPathLeg newLeg = std::move(sourceLeg); // Move constructor called here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<TransportPathLeg> legs;

      TransportPathLeg leg1, leg2;

      legs.push_back(std::move(leg1));

      legs.emplace_back(std::move(leg2)); // Move into vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed for efficiency
    by transferring ownership rather than copying data. After moving, the source object
    should be considered in a valid but unspecified state and must not be accessed.
  warnings: Attempting to use the source object after a move operation results in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that all references to the moved-from object are invalidated
    before continuing execution.
