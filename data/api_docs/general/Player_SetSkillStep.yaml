  class: Player
  method: SetSkillStep
  signature: void Player::SetSkillStep(uint32 pos, uint16 step)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the skill step for a specified skill position in the player's skill
    list.
  description: The SetSkillStep method allows a player to modify the step value of
    a specific skill at a given position within their skill list. This method is typically
    used during skill progression or when adjusting skill levels for training purposes.
    It directly manipulates the skill data stored in the player's database, affecting
    how skills are displayed and processed in-game. The method requires valid skill
    positions and step values to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position in the skill list where the skill step should be modified.
      This represents a zero-based index into the player's skill array.
  - name: step
    description: The new skill step value to set at the specified position. This value
      must be within valid range for skill progression and should not exceed maximum
      skill limits.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Skill Step Setting Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSkillStep(0, 100);

      // Sets the first skill''s step to 100'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Skill Step Setting with Validation
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nuint32 skillPosition = 5;\nuint16 newStep\
      \ = 200;\nif (skillPosition < player->GetSkillList().size()) {\n    player->SetSkillStep(skillPosition,\
      \ newStep);\n}\n// Ensures valid position before setting skill step"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's skill data in memory and may require
    synchronization with database updates. It should be used carefully during skill
    progression or training to avoid unintended consequences.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to invalid skill states or incorrect
    skill progression. Care must be taken to ensure that step values are valid and
    within appropriate ranges for the skill being modified.
