documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AreaTriggerEntityScript instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AreaTriggerEntityScript class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used by
    the script instance. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    area trigger scripts are used to define custom behaviors when players enter or
    interact with specific area triggers in the game world. This destructor ensures
    proper cleanup of the script's internal state and prevents memory leaks when the
    script object is no longer needed. It is automatically invoked by the game engine
    when the script instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AreaTriggerEntityScript
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerScript : public AreaTriggerEntityScript\n{\npublic:\n\
      \    MyAreaTriggerScript() : AreaTriggerEntityScript(\"my_area_trigger_script\"\
      ) {}\n    ~MyAreaTriggerScript() override {}\n};\n\n// The destructor is automatically\
      \ called when the object goes out of scope\nvoid UseScript()\n{\n    MyAreaTriggerScript\
      \ script;\n    // When 'script' goes out of scope, its destructor (~MyAreaTriggerScript)\
      \ is called\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically not called directly by user code. It's automatically
    invoked by the C++ runtime when an object goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers
    should ensure that any custom cleanup logic in derived classes is properly implemented
    in their own destructors, as this base class destructor only handles basic cleanup.
