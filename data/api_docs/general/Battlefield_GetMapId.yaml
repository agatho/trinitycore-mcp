  class: Battlefield
  method: GetMapId
  signature: int Battlefield::GetMapId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the map identifier associated with the battlefield instance.
  description: The GetMapId method returns the unique map identifier (MapID) that
    corresponds to the battlefield instance. This identifier is used internally by
    TrinityCore to determine which map the battlefield operates on, and is essential
    for handling battlefield-related game mechanics such as player movement, zone
    triggers, and objective management. The returned value typically maps to a specific
    World of Warcraft map where the battlefield takes place. This method is commonly
    used in battlefield scripts and event handlers to ensure operations are performed
    on the correct map context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the MapID of the battlefield. This corresponds
    to a valid map entry in the game's database, typically ranging from 0 to several
    thousand depending on the expansion and content version.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattleFieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    int mapId = bf->GetMapId();\n    printf(\"Battlefield is on\
      \ map ID: %d\\n\", mapId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using MapID for Zone Checks
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattleFieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    int mapId = bf->GetMapId();\n    if (mapId == 530) // Outland\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle Outland-specific battlefield logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not modify any internal state.
    It's safe to call from multiple threads as long as the Battlefield object itself
    is not being modified concurrently. The returned MapID should be validated against
    the game's map database to ensure it represents a valid map.
  warnings: Ensure that the Battlefield instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as calling it on an invalid or uninitialized battlefield may return
    unexpected values. Also note that the MapID returned might not always correspond
    to a player-accessible map in all cases.
