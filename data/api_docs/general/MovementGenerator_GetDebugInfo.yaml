documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information string describing the current movement generator
    state
  description: The GetDebugInfo method provides a human-readable string representation
    of the movement generator's current state and configuration. This method is primarily
    used for debugging purposes to help developers understand the active movement
    behavior of units in the game world. The returned string typically includes details
    about the movement type, target information, and any relevant parameters that
    define the current movement logic. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe to call during normal gameplay operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted debug information about the movement
    generator's current state, including movement type, target details, and relevant
    configuration parameters
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: "void DebugMovement(MovementGenerator* mg)\n{\n    if (mg)\n    {\n    \
      \    std::string debugInfo = mg->GetDebugInfo();\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Movement Debug Info: %s\", debugInfo.c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for debugging and development purposes only. The
    exact format of the returned string may vary between different movement generator
    implementations and can be subject to change in future versions. The method should
    not be relied upon for game logic decisions as its primary purpose is diagnostic
    information.
