  class: Map
  method: CheckRespawn
  signature: bool Map::CheckRespawn(RespawnInfo * info)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a respawn is required for a given respawn info object.
  description: The CheckRespawn method evaluates whether a specific respawn condition
    has been met for an object or entity within the map. It typically checks if a
    creature, game object, or other map entity needs to be respawned based on its
    respawn timer or other conditions. This method is commonly used in the TrinityCore
    server's core mechanics to manage dynamic content and ensure proper world state
    updates. The method takes a RespawnInfo pointer which contains information about
    the entity that may need respawning.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the respawn condition has been met and the object should
    be respawned, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the entity's
    respawn timer has expired or other conditions have been satisfied to trigger a
    respawn.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Respawn Check Usage
    code: "RespawnInfo* info = new RespawnInfo();\n// Set up respawn info for a creature\n\
      bool shouldRespawn = map->CheckRespawn(info);\nif (shouldRespawn)\n{\n    //\
      \ Handle respawn logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during map update cycles or when specific
    events occur that might trigger a respawn. The RespawnInfo object passed to this
    method should be properly initialized with relevant data before calling the function.
    Performance-wise, this method should be lightweight as it's often called frequently
    during server updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the RespawnInfo pointer passed to this method is valid and
    properly initialized to avoid undefined behavior. Improper handling of respawn
    conditions can lead to entities not respawning correctly or respawning too frequently.
