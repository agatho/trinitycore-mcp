  class: BattlePetManager
  method: GetPlayerTeams
  signature: int BattlePetManager::GetPlayerTeams(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the player's battle pet teams and returns the number of teams found.
  description: The GetPlayerTeams method retrieves all battle pet teams associated
    with the current player. It populates an array with team data and returns the
    count of valid teams. This method is typically used in the context of World of
    Warcraft's Battle Pet system, where players can organize their pets into multiple
    teams for battles. The method assumes that the BattlePetManager instance is properly
    initialized with a valid player context. The returned integer indicates how many
    teams were successfully retrieved from the player's data store.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer array that will be populated with team data.
      The array must be pre-allocated with sufficient space to hold all team information.
  returns: Returns the number of battle pet teams found for the player. A return value
    of 0 indicates no teams were found or an error occurred during retrieval. Negative
    values may indicate specific error conditions depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve player's battle pet teams
    code: "BattlePetManager* manager = ...; // Assume initialized\nint teams[10];\
      \ // Pre-allocated array\nint count = manager->GetPlayerTeams(teams);\nif (count\
      \ > 0) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {\n        printf(\"Team %d: %d\\\
      n\", i, teams[i]);\n    }\n} else {\n    printf(\"No teams found or error occurred.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Battle Pet system in TrinityCore and requires
    a valid player context to function correctly. The 'player' parameter must point
    to a pre-allocated array that can accommodate all expected team data. Performance
    may be affected if large numbers of teams are stored per player.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'player' parameter points to a sufficiently large array
    to avoid buffer overflows. This method should not be called without proper initialization
    of the BattlePetManager instance. Incorrect handling of return values might lead
    to undefined behavior when accessing team data.
