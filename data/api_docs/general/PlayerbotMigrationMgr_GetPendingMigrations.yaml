  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: GetPendingMigrations
  signature: std::vector<std::string> PlayerbotMigrationMgr::GetPendingMigrations()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of pending playerbot migrations that have not yet been applied.
  description: The GetPendingMigrations method returns a vector of strings representing
    the identifiers of playerbot migrations that are currently pending application.
    This functionality is typically used in the context of managing automated updates
    or configuration changes for playerbot behavior within the TrinityCore framework.
    The returned migration IDs can be used to track which migrations have been processed
    and which remain to be applied. This method does not modify any state; it simply
    retrieves and reports the current set of pending migrations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<std::string> containing the unique identifiers (IDs) of all
    pending playerbot migrations. Each string in the vector represents a migration
    that has been registered but not yet executed.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate over pending migrations
    code: "std::vector<std::string> pendingMigrations = sPlayerbotMigrationMgr->GetPendingMigrations();\n\
      for (const auto& migrationId : pendingMigrations) {\n    std::cout << \"Pending\
      \ migration: \" << migrationId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during system initialization or periodic
    maintenance checks to determine what migrations need to be applied. The underlying
    data structure for storing pending migrations should be thread-safe if accessed
    from multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the PlayerbotMigrationMgr singleton is properly initialized
    before calling this method, otherwise it may return an empty vector or cause undefined
    behavior.
