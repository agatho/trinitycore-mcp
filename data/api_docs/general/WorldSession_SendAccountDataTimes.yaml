  class: WorldSession
  method: SendAccountDataTimes
  signature: void WorldSession::SendAccountDataTimes(int playerGuid, uint32 mask)
documentation:
  brief: Sends account data update timestamps to the client for specified player and
    data mask.
  description: The SendAccountDataTimes method transmits a list of timestamp values
    to the connected client, indicating when various types of account data were last
    updated. This is used by the WorldSession to synchronize client-side data with
    server-side changes. The method takes a player GUID and a bitmask that specifies
    which data types' timestamps should be sent. Each bit in the mask corresponds
    to a specific type of account data, such as inventory, mail, or quest progress.
    The client uses these timestamps to determine whether it needs to request updated
    information from the server.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose account data timestamps
      are being sent. This is typically used to identify which player's data should
      be synchronized.
  - name: mask
    description: A bitmask specifying which types of account data timestamps to send.
      Each bit represents a different category of account data, such as inventory,
      mail, or quest progress. The exact mapping of bits to data types is defined
      within the TrinityCore implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send Account Data Times for Player
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      uint32 mask = 0x00000001; // Example bitmask

      session->SendAccountDataTimes(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), mask);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during login or when account data changes
    occur. It's part of the synchronization mechanism between server and client for
    persistent player data. The implementation may vary based on the type of account
    data being synchronized.
