documentation:
  brief: Consolidates fragmented memory blocks within the bot's memory management
    system to optimize memory usage and reduce fragmentation.
  description: The ConsolidateFragmentedMemory method is responsible for optimizing
    the internal memory layout of a bot's memory manager by merging adjacent free
    memory blocks into larger contiguous segments. This process helps reduce memory
    fragmentation, which can otherwise lead to inefficient memory allocation and potential
    performance degradation over time. The method typically operates on the bot's
    memory heap or arena, identifying and coalescing free blocks that are adjacent
    in memory. It is commonly invoked during periodic memory cleanup routines or when
    the system detects significant fragmentation. This operation ensures that larger
    memory requests can be fulfilled more efficiently by finding suitable contiguous
    blocks.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = bot->GetMemoryManager();

      memoryManager->ConsolidateFragmentedMemory();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the bot's memory management
    system during idle periods or after significant memory allocation/deallocation
    operations. It may involve locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety during consolidation,
    especially in multi-threaded environments where multiple bots might access shared
    memory pools.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently can introduce performance overhead due
    to the scanning and merging process. It should not be invoked excessively in performance-critical
    sections of code. Additionally, if the method is called while other threads are
    actively allocating or deallocating memory, it may cause temporary blocking or
    inconsistent results.
