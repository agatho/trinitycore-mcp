documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a dispellable aura should be removed based on its roll
    probability.
  description: The RollDispel method evaluates if a dispellable aura should be removed
    from a target. This method typically simulates a random chance-based removal mechanism,
    often used in conjunction with spell effects that can be dispelled. The outcome
    is determined by internal logic that may consider factors such as the aura's dispel
    resistance, the caster's level, or other game mechanics. It is commonly invoked
    during aura application or update cycles to decide whether an aura should be removed
    from a unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura passes the dispel roll and should be removed;
    otherwise returns false if the aura remains active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Update
    code: "if (aura->RollDispel())\n{\n    // Remove the aura from target\n    target->RemoveAura(aura);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the TrinityCore server to simulate
    random dispel mechanics, such as those found in spells like 'Dispel Magic' or
    similar effects. The exact probability calculation may depend on internal game
    rules and configurations.
