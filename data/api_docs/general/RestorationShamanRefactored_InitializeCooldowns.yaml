documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for restoration shaman abilities
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up internal cooldown tracking structures
    for all restoration shaman abilities. This method is typically called during player
    initialization or when switching to the restoration shaman specialization. It
    ensures that all spell cooldowns are properly registered with the cooldown system,
    allowing proper tracking of ability readiness and preventing premature usage.
    The method initializes default cooldown values for key restoration spells such
    as Healing Wave, Chain Heal, and Earthliving Weapon.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'RestorationShamanRefactored shaman;

      shaman.InitializeCooldowns();

      // Cooldowns are now initialized for restoration abilities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the shaman's initialization
    phase. It directly interacts with the TrinityCore cooldown system and modifies
    internal state variables. The method does not require any external parameters
    as all cooldown information is derived from the class's spell database.
