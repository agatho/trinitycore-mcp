documentation:
  brief: Returns the creature text repeat group identifier for a given text group.
  description: This method retrieves the CreatureTextRepeatIds structure associated
    with a specific text group from the creature's text data. It allows access to
    the repeat group information that determines how often a particular text group
    can be repeated in the creature's dialogue system. The method is typically used
    when managing creature text interactions and ensuring proper repetition handling
    during NPC conversations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the CreatureTextRepeatIds structure which contains the repeat group
    identifier for the specified text group, allowing for proper handling of text
    repetition in creature dialogue systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "CreatureTextRepeatIds repeatGroup = creature->GetTextRepeatGroup(0);\n\
      if (repeatGroup != 0)\n{\n    // Handle repeat group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the creature text system implementation and should
    be used in conjunction with other text-related methods. The return value represents
    a unique identifier that helps determine how many times a specific text group
    can be repeated.
  warnings: The method may return zero if no repeat group exists for the specified
    text group, which could lead to incorrect handling of creature dialogue if not
    properly checked.
