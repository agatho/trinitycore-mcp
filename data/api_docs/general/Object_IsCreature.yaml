documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is a creature type.
  description: The IsCreature method checks if the current Object instance represents
    a creature within the World of Warcraft game world. This method is commonly used
    in game logic to differentiate between player characters and non-player entities,
    such as NPCs or mobs. It returns true when the object is classified as a creature,
    and false otherwise. The method is particularly useful for conditional logic in
    scripts where specific behavior needs to be applied based on whether an object
    is a creature or not.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is a creature type, false otherwise. This indicates
    that the object represents a non-player character entity in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (object->IsCreature()) {\n    // Handle creature-specific logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = dynamic_cast<Creature*>(object);\nif (creature &&\
      \ creature->IsCreature()) {\n    // Perform creature-specific actions\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Object hierarchy and relies on internal object
    type flags. It should be used carefully in performance-critical code sections
    as it involves type checking operations. The method is thread-safe and can be
    called from any thread context.
