  class: WrongPasswordAppend
  method: Append
  signature: void WrongPasswordAppend::Append(WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    & param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet for handling wrong password attempts.
  description: The WrongPasswordAppend::Append method is responsible for populating
    a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet with specific data related to incorrect
    password attempts when joining a channel. This method is typically invoked during
    the channel join process to notify the client that the provided password was invalid.
    It modifies the input packet in-place by adding relevant notification information
    such as the channel name and error code, ensuring that the client receives appropriate
    feedback about the failed authentication attempt. The method does not return any
    value but directly alters the state of the provided packet object.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet object
      that will be populated with wrong password notification data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Channel Join Logic
    code: 'WrongPasswordAppend append;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      // Assume channel join fails due to wrong password

      append.Append(notifyPacket);

      // Send notifyPacket to the client to inform them about the failed attempt'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal packet handling system for
    channel operations. It assumes that the input packet object has been properly
    initialized and is ready to receive notification data. The method should only
    be called when a password validation failure occurs during channel access.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify object is
    valid and not null before calling this method, as modifying an invalid packet
    may lead to undefined behavior or client-side crashes.
