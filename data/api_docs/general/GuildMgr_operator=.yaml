documentation:
  brief: Moves a GuildMgr object, transferring ownership of its resources to the target
    object.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment on a GuildMgr object,
    effectively transferring all internal resources and state from the source object
    to the target object. This is a standard C++ move semantics implementation that
    leaves the source object in a valid but unspecified state. In the context of TrinityCore's
    Guild management system, this operation allows for efficient resource management
    when reassigning guild data structures, particularly useful during guild creation,
    destruction, or state transitions. The method ensures that no duplicate resources
    are maintained and that memory is properly transferred between instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target GuildMgr object after the move assignment has
    been completed, enabling chained assignments if needed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'GuildMgr sourceGuild;

      // ... populate sourceGuild ...

      GuildMgr targetGuild = std::move(sourceGuild); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Move Assignment
    code: 'GuildMgr guild1, guild2, guild3;

      // ... initialize guilds ...

      guild1 = std::move(guild2) = std::move(guild3); // Chained move assignments'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard C++ move semantics and should be used
    carefully to avoid dangling references. After a move assignment, the source object's
    state becomes undefined but remains valid for subsequent operations like destruction
    or assignment.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after a move assignment as its contents are
    left in an unspecified but valid state. This can lead to undefined behavior if
    accessed directly.
