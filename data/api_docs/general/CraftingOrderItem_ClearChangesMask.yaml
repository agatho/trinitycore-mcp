documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the crafting order item, resetting its modified
    state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a CraftingOrderItem
    instance, effectively marking all fields as unmodified. This is typically used
    after synchronizing or processing changes to ensure that subsequent modifications
    can be properly tracked. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    this method helps maintain data consistency for crafting orders by clearing any
    pending change notifications. The operation has no parameters and does not return
    a value. It should be called when the system needs to acknowledge that all previous
    changes have been handled or applied.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CraftingOrderItem item;

      // ... modify item fields ...

      item.ClearChangesMask();

      // Changes mask is now cleared, no pending modifications'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with change tracking systems
    to reset modification flags after data synchronization. It's important to understand
    that clearing the mask does not revert field values; it only resets the tracking
    mechanism.
