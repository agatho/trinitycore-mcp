  brief: Checks whether the player has completed and received rewards for a specific
    quest
  description: The IsQuestRewarded method determines if a player has already completed
    a given quest and received all associated rewards. This is commonly used in quest-related
    logic to prevent duplicate reward distribution or to check quest completion status
    before offering new objectives. The method typically queries internal player data
    structures that track quest completion state, including reward flags and progression
    markers. It's important to note that this check is usually performed after the
    quest has been marked as complete but before any potential reward processing occurs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest has been completed and rewards have
    been claimed by the player; returns false if the quest is not yet completed, or
    if rewards have not been claimed yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Check
    code: "if (player->IsQuestRewarded(12345)) {\n    // Player has already received\
      \ rewards for quest 12345\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You have already completed\
      \ this quest.\");\n} else {\n    // Player can still claim rewards for this\
      \ quest\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You can still complete this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Giver Interaction
    code: "if (!player->IsQuestRewarded(67890)) {\n    // Only show reward options\
      \ if quest hasn't been rewarded\n    player->AddQuestReward(67890);\n    player->SendQuestComplete(67890);\n\
      } else {\n    // Quest already completed, inform the player\n    player->SendQuestAlreadyCompleted(67890);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest state tracking within the TrinityCore
    database and player session data. The implementation likely uses cached or stored
    quest completion flags rather than recalculating quest status each time. Performance
    is generally good as it's a simple lookup operation, but frequent calls should
    be avoided in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return false for quests that are marked
    complete but not yet rewarded due to pending reward processing or server-side
    logic delays. Also, ensure the quest ID passed is valid and corresponds to an
    actual quest in the database; invalid IDs might cause undefined behavior or errors
    depending on implementation.
