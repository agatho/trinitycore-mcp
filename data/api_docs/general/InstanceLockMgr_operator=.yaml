  brief: Moves ownership of an InstanceLockMgr object to another InstanceLockMgr object.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources from the right-hand
    side InstanceLockMgr object to the left-hand side object. This operation is typically
    used to efficiently transfer ownership of instance lock data without copying expensive
    resources. After the move, the right-hand side object will be left in a valid
    but unspecified state. The method ensures that any existing locks or references
    in the target object are properly released before acquiring the new ones. In the
    context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this is commonly used when managing
    instance lock states for dungeons or raids where ownership needs to be transferred
    between different systems or during cleanup operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the left-hand side InstanceLockMgr object after the move
    operation has completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'InstanceLockMgr lock1;

      InstanceLockMgr lock2 = std::move(lock1); // Move lock1''s resources to lock2

      // lock1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container
    code: 'std::vector<InstanceLockMgr> locks;

      locks.emplace_back();

      InstanceLockMgr newLock;

      locks[0] = std::move(newLock); // Move newLock into the vector element

      // newLock is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation which is typically more efficient
    than copy operations. The moved-from object should not be used after the move
    operation, as it will be left in a valid but unspecified state. This implementation
    follows standard C++ move semantics and is designed to work with STL containers
    and smart pointer patterns commonly found in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move assignment can lead to undefined
    behavior. The right-hand side object becomes invalid after the operation, so any
    references or pointers to it should not be used. This operator should only be
    called when you are certain that the source object's resources are no longer needed.
