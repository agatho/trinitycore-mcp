documentation:
  brief: Updates the blood state of the Death Knight, managing rune regeneration and
    resource tracking.
  description: The UpdateBloodState method is responsible for managing the internal
    state of a Blood Death Knight's runes and resource management. This method typically
    handles the regeneration of blood runes, updates the cooldown timers for rune
    usage, and ensures that the player's resource pool remains synchronized with game
    mechanics. It is called periodically during the game loop to maintain accurate
    state information for abilities that consume runes. The method may also handle
    interactions with Blood Presence and other class-specific mechanics that affect
    rune generation or usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    m_deathKnight->UpdateBloodState();\n\
      \    // ... continue with rest of loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core game loop or through
    specific event triggers. Developers should be aware that rune regeneration rates
    may vary based on talents, buffs, and gear. The implementation likely involves
    internal state tracking for each of the Death Knight's runes and their individual
    cooldown timers.
  warnings: Calling this method manually outside of the intended game loop context
    may cause inconsistent state or unexpected behavior. Ensure proper synchronization
    if used in multithreaded environments.
