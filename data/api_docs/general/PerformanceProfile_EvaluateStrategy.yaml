  method: EvaluateStrategy
  signature: float PerformanceProfile::EvaluateStrategy(const OptimizationStrategy
    & strategy) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a performance score for a given optimization strategy.
  description: The EvaluateStrategy method computes a numerical performance score
    for a provided OptimizationStrategy object. This score represents how effectively
    the strategy is expected to perform within the context of the game's AI or resource
    management systems. The method likely considers various factors such as execution
    time, resource usage, and strategic effectiveness to determine this score. It
    is typically used in automated decision-making processes where multiple strategies
    need to be compared and ranked based on their predicted performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the evaluated performance score of the optimization
    strategy. Higher values generally indicate better performance, though the exact
    scale and interpretation may depend on the specific implementation and context
    within which this method is used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Evaluation
    code: 'PerformanceProfile profile;

      OptimizationStrategy strategy;

      // Configure strategy with specific parameters

      float score = profile.EvaluateStrategy(strategy);

      // Use the score to make decisions about strategy selection'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in performance-critical sections of AI systems
    where strategies must be evaluated quickly and efficiently. The implementation
    may cache results or use heuristics to optimize repeated evaluations.
