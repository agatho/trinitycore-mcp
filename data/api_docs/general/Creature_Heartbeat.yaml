documentation:
  brief: Executes the creature's heartbeat routine to update its AI state and perform
    periodic actions
  description: The Heartbeat method is a core function in TrinityCore's Creature class
    that manages the creature's artificial intelligence behavior by executing periodic
    updates. This method handles the creature's AI state transitions, performs necessary
    actions based on the current AI state, and ensures proper synchronization with
    the game world. It typically runs at regular intervals to maintain creature functionality
    and prevent AI-related issues. The method is crucial for maintaining creature
    behavior consistency during gameplay and ensures that creatures respond appropriately
    to environmental changes.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature;

      creature->Heartbeat();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the game server's update loop and should
    not be invoked directly in most cases. The implementation may vary based on creature's
    AI type, with different behaviors for different AI states. Performance considerations
    include potential CPU overhead from AI updates and synchronization with other
    creatures.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can cause creature AI issues or unexpected
    behavior. This method should not be called directly unless specifically required
    by custom AI implementations. Avoid calling it in tight loops as it may cause
    performance degradation.
