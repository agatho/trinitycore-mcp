  method: Update
  signature: void BotSpawner::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot spawner's internal state and manages bot creation or removal
    based on configured conditions.
  description: The Update method is responsible for driving the core logic of the
    BotSpawner class. It processes time-based events, evaluates spawn conditions,
    and manages the lifecycle of bots within the system. This method is typically
    called from the game loop at regular intervals to ensure that bots are created
    or destroyed according to configured rules, such as player count thresholds, time
    limits, or server load conditions. The method handles internal state transitions
    and ensures that bot spawning adheres to defined constraints like maximum bot
    limits or cooldown periods between spawns.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // Simulate game tick\n    uint32 diff = 1000;\
      \ // 1 second since last update\n    botSpawner->Update(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with World Update
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other world updates ...\n\
      \    botSpawner->Update(diff);\n    // ... continue other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop to ensure
    proper bot behavior. It may perform database operations or send network packets,
    so performance considerations are important. The implementation likely uses internal
    timers and counters to track spawn cooldowns and state transitions.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the game loop without understanding
    its side effects. Improper timing of calls could lead to unexpected bot behavior
    or resource exhaustion.
