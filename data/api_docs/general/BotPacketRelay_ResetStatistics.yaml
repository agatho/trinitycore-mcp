documentation:
  brief: Resets all packet relay statistics for the bot.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears all accumulated packet relay metrics
    and counters within the BotPacketRelay class. This includes resetting internal
    tracking of sent/received packets, timing data, and any performance-related statistics.
    The method is typically invoked when a bot's session needs to be reset or when
    statistics are no longer relevant. It ensures clean state for subsequent operations
    without affecting the core functionality of the packet relay mechanism.

    starting new statistical analysis.
