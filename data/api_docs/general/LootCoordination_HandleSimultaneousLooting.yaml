  class: LootCoordination
  method: HandleSimultaneousLooting
  signature: void LootCoordination::HandleSimultaneousLooting(Group * group, const
    int & items)
documentation:
  brief: Processes simultaneous looting for group members in a loot coordination scenario.
  description: The HandleSimultaneousLooting method manages the distribution of loot
    items among group members when simultaneous looting is enabled. This method coordinates
    the looting process to ensure that all group members have an equal opportunity
    to roll on items, typically used during group loot scenarios such as dungeon or
    raid encounters. It handles the internal state management and communication between
    players to maintain fairness in item distribution. The method assumes that the
    group has been properly initialized with valid members and that the loot system
    is active.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players participating
      in simultaneous looting. Must not be null and should contain valid group members.
  - name: items
    description: Integer reference indicating the number of items to be distributed
      simultaneously. Should be a positive integer representing the count of loot
      items available for group looting.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic simultaneous looting handling
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      int item_count = 5;

      lootCoordination->HandleSimultaneousLooting(group, item_count);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Simultaneous looting with dynamic item count
    code: "if (player->GetGroup()) {\n    int items_to_loot = GetLootItemCount();\n\
      \    lootCoordination->HandleSimultaneousLooting(player->GetGroup(), items_to_loot);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group loot events and requires that
    the group has been properly initialized with valid members. The implementation
    may involve internal synchronization to ensure thread safety during concurrent
    looting operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior. Also, verify
    that the items count is positive to avoid unexpected loot distribution issues.
