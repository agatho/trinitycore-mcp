documentation:
  brief: Manages guild calendar events and interactions for a specified player.
  description: The ManageGuildCalendar method handles all aspects of guild calendar
    functionality for a given player, including event creation, attendance tracking,
    and synchronization with the player's calendar. This method is typically invoked
    when a player interacts with their guild's calendar interface or when calendar-related
    actions occur within the game world. It ensures that player calendar data remains
    consistent with guild scheduling and maintains proper access controls for calendar
    events.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the game system. This parameter is used to identify which player's
      calendar data should be managed and updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Calendar Management
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.ManageGuildCalendar(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Multiple Players' Calendars
    code: "std::vector<int> playerIds = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nGuildIntegration guildInt;\n\
      for (int playerId : playerIds) {\n    guildInt.ManageGuildCalendar(&playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal TrinityCore systems for handling
    guild data, calendar events, and player synchronization. It may perform database
    operations to persist calendar changes and could be called frequently during guild
    activities or calendar updates.
  warnings: The method expects a valid player GUID in the provided pointer; passing
    an invalid or null pointer may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure
    proper validation of player data before calling this method.
