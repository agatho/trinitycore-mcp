  signature: bool Quest::HasSpecialFlag(QuestSpecialFlags flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest possesses a specific special flag.
  description: This method checks if a quest has a particular special flag set, which
    is used to identify quests with unique characteristics or behaviors. The method
    returns true if the specified flag is present in the quest's special flags, false
    otherwise. This functionality is essential for identifying quests that require
    special handling or have unique game mechanics such as being a daily quest, a
    heroic quest, or having special quest flags like "QuestFlagDaily" or "QuestFlagRepeatable".
    The method is commonly used during quest processing and validation to ensure proper
    quest behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest has the specified special flag set, false otherwise.
    The return value represents whether the quest's special flags contain the given
    flag.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->HasSpecialFlag(QuestSpecialFlags::QUEST_FLAG_REPEATABLE)) {\n\
      \    // Quest is repeatable\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for daily quest flag
    code: "if (quest->HasSpecialFlag(QuestSpecialFlags::QUEST_FLAG_DAILY)) {\n   \
      \ // Quest is a daily quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the quest's special flags bitmask, which is set during
    quest creation or loading. It should be used carefully as it may affect quest
    processing logic and behavior. Performance-wise, this method is lightweight as
    it simply checks a flag in a bitmask.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the quest actually exists or has
    been loaded properly. It only checks if the special flags are set, so calling
    this method on an invalid quest object may lead to undefined behavior. Always
    ensure that the quest object is valid before calling this method.
