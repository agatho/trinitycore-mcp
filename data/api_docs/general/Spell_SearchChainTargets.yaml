  brief: Searches for chain targets based on spell effect and target selection criteria
  description: This method performs chain target searching for spells that require
    chain targeting, such as chain lightning or chain heal effects. It identifies
    valid targets within the specified range and selection criteria, considering the
    spell's effect parameters and target object types. The method handles both single
    and multiple target selections based on the provided parameters and is commonly
    used in spell processing for determining target selection during chain-based spell
    effects.
  parameters:
  - name: targets
    description: Reference to integer that will store the number of targets found
      in the chain. This parameter is modified by the method to indicate how many
      valid targets were identified.
  - name: chainTargets
    description: The maximum number of targets allowed in the chain. This determines
      how many targets can be selected for chain-based spell effects, typically used
      for spells like chain lightning or chain heal.
  - name: target
    description: The WorldObject to start searching from. This represents the initial
      target object that the chain search begins from, usually the caster or a specific
      target.
  - name: objectType
    description: Specifies the type of WorldObject to search for. This parameter defines
      whether to search for players, gameobjects, creatures, or other object types
      based on the spell's requirements.
  - name: selectType
    description: The selection criteria for target searching. This determines how
      targets are selected, such as selecting nearest targets, random targets, or
      specific target types based on the spell effect.
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: The SpellEffectInfo structure containing details about the spell
      effect being processed. This includes parameters like effect type, radius, and
      other relevant information that affects chain target selection.
  - name: isChainHeal
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this is a chain heal spell. This
      affects how targets are selected and processed, particularly for healing spells
      where the method needs to determine valid heal targets within chain range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chain Target Search Example
    code: 'Spell::SearchChainTargets(targets, chainTargets, target, objectType, selectType,
      spellEffectInfo, isChainHeal);

      // Example usage in a spell processing context

      int numTargets = 0;

      uint32 chainTargetCount = 5;

      WorldObject* targetObj = nullptr;

      SpellTargetObjectTypes objType = SPELL_TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_PLAYER;

      SpellTargetCheckTypes checkType = SPELL_TARGET_CHECK_TYPE_NEAREST;

      SpellEffectInfo effectInfo = SpellEffectInfo();

      bool isHeal = true;

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in spell processing to determine valid chain
    targets for spells like chain lightning or chain heal. It may involve complex
    target selection logic based on object types and selection criteria, and should
    be used carefully when handling multiple targets. The implementation involves
    checking target validity and selecting appropriate targets based on the specified
    parameters.
  warnings: This method requires careful handling of target selection parameters as
    incorrect usage can lead to invalid target selections or chain targeting errors.
    It is important to ensure that all parameters are properly initialized before
    calling this method, especially when dealing with complex spell effects involving
    multiple targets.
