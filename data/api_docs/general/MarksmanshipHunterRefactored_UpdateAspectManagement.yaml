documentation:
  brief: Updates the management state of aspects for the marksmanship hunter, ensuring
    proper aspect application and removal based on current combat conditions.
  description: The UpdateAspectManagement method is responsible for dynamically managing
    the application and removal of aspects for a marksmanship hunter class. This method
    evaluates the current combat situation, including target status, player buffs,
    and cooldowns, to determine whether specific aspects should be active or deactivated.
    It ensures that the hunter maintains optimal aspect usage according to gameplay
    mechanics and class-specific rules. The method typically runs during combat updates
    or when aspect-related conditions change, maintaining synchronization between
    the hunter's aspect state and game logic. This functionality is crucial for proper
    marksmanship hunter performance in both PvE and PvP scenarios.
  parameters: []

  examples:
  - title: Basic Aspect Management Update
    code: "void UpdateAspectManagement()\n{\n    // Internal logic to check and update\
      \ aspect states\n    if (HasAura(SPELL_ASPECT_OF_THE_HAWK))\n    {\n       \
      \ // Ensure aspect is properly applied\n        ApplyAspectIfNecessary();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Remove inactive aspects\n        RemoveInactiveAspects();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to maintain
    aspect state consistency. It may interact with other AI systems such as target
    selection and spell casting logic. The implementation assumes that the hunter's
    current target and aura states are properly maintained by the core game engine.
  warnings: Improper handling of aspect management can lead to incorrect spell behavior
    or loss of class-specific bonuses. Ensure this method is not called during critical
    spell casts that might conflict with aspect application timing.
