  class: WorldSession
  method: SetSecurity
  signature: void WorldSession::SetSecurity(AccountTypes security)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the security level of the account associated with this session.
  description: The SetSecurity method updates the security permissions level for the
    account linked to the current WorldSession. This security level determines what
    administrative commands and privileges the player has within the game world. The
    method typically modifies internal session state and may trigger synchronization
    of security settings with the database or other subsystems. It is commonly used
    during login processes, account modifications, or when granting/demoting administrative
    rights.
  parameters:
  - name: security
    description: The new AccountTypes security level to assign to this session's account.
      Valid values are defined by the AccountTypes enumeration, typically including
      GMAccount, AdminAccount, and PlayerAccount levels.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a player as a Game Master
    code: 'WorldSession* session = ...;

      session->SetSecurity(SEC_GAMEMASTER);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Demoting an admin account to regular player
    code: 'WorldSession* session = ...;

      session->SetSecurity(SEC_PLAYER);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal session state and may require synchronization
    with the database. It's typically invoked during authentication or administrative
    operations. The actual enforcement of security privileges is handled by other
    systems in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Direct use of this method without proper validation may lead to privilege
    escalation issues. Ensure that only trusted code (such as from admin commands
    or login handlers) calls this method.
