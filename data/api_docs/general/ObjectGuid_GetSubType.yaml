documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the subtype identifier from an ObjectGuid instance
  description: The GetSubType method extracts and returns the subtype component of
    an ObjectGuid. In TrinityCore's object identification system, ObjectGuids are
    composed of multiple parts including a type, subtype, and a unique identifier.
    This method specifically retrieves the subtype portion which categorizes objects
    within their respective type groups. The returned value typically represents the
    specific category or variant of the object type, such as different creature types,
    game object types, or player-related subtypes. This functionality is essential
    for identifying and differentiating between various object instances of the same
    general type.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the subtype component of the ObjectGuid. This
    value indicates the specific category or variant within the object's type group,
    with different numerical values corresponding to different subtypes such as creature
    family, game object display ID, or player subclass identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine object subtype
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      uint32 subtype = guid.GetSubType();

      // subtype will contain the subtype value for player objects'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using subtype to differentiate creature types
    code: "ObjectGuid creatureGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Creature>(1001,\
      \ 5);\nuint32 creatureSubtype = creatureGuid.GetSubType();\n// creatureSubtype\
      \ will be 5, indicating a specific creature subtype\nif (creatureSubtype ==\
      \ 5) {\n    // Handle specific creature type\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on the internal bit layout of ObjectGuid and assumes
    proper initialization. The subtype value is typically used in conjunction with
    the high guid type to uniquely identify object instances within the game world.
    This method does not perform any validation or bounds checking on the returned
    value.
  warnings: Ensure that the ObjectGuid instance has been properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing uninitialized data may result in undefined behavior.
    The subtype value should be interpreted according to the specific type of object
    the GUID represents.
