  signature: bool GameObject::IsInvisibleDueToDespawn(const int * seer) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the game object is invisible due to its despawn state.
  description: The IsInvisibleDueToDespawn method checks if a GameObject is currently
    invisible because it has been despawned. This typically occurs when an object's
    despawn timer has expired or when the object is in a state where it should not
    be visually present to players. The method returns true if the object is invisible
    due to despawn, and false otherwise. This check is important for determining visibility
    logic in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: Optional pointer to a player object that can see the game object.
      If provided, this parameter may be used to determine visibility from a specific
      player's perspective.
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject is invisible due to being despawned, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if an object is invisible due to despawn
    code: "GameObject* go = ...; // Assume this is a valid GameObject pointer\nif\
      \ (go->IsInvisibleDueToDespawn()) {\n    // Handle the case where the object\
      \ is invisible due to despawn\n    printf(\"Object is invisible due to despawn\
      \ state\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Object is visible or not in despawn state\n\
      \    printf(\"Object is visible or active\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal GameObject state flags related to despawn
    timers and visibility. It may be used in conjunction with other visibility-related
    methods to determine if an object should be rendered to players.
  warnings: Be aware that the seer parameter is optional and may be null. If it's
    not properly checked, accessing a null pointer could cause undefined behavior.
    Also, this method only reflects the despawn state; other factors like invisibility
    due to stealth or other effects are not considered.
