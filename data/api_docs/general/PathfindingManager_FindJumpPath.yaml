  class: PathfindingManager
  method: FindJumpPath
  signature: PathResult PathfindingManager::FindJumpPath(const int & start, const
    int & goal)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a jump path from a starting point to a goal point
    using the pathfinding system.
  description: The FindJumpPath method computes a valid jump-based path between two
    specified points in the game world. It is typically used by AI-controlled creatures
    or NPCs that need to navigate complex terrain involving jumps, such as climbing
    ledges or crossing gaps. The method leverages the internal pathfinding algorithms
    to determine a sequence of waypoints that represent a feasible jumping motion
    from start to goal. This functionality is essential for realistic NPC movement
    in environments with vertical obstacles. The method assumes both start and goal
    positions are valid and within the same map instance.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting position identifier or index for the jump path calculation.
      This usually corresponds to a node or waypoint in the navigation mesh.
  - name: goal
    description: The target position identifier or index for the jump path calculation.
      Must be a valid node within the same map as the start point.
  returns: A PathResult object containing the computed jump path, including waypoints
    and movement data. If no valid path exists between the start and goal points,
    it returns an empty or invalid path result.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of FindJumpPath
    code: "PathResult result = pathfindingManager->FindJumpPath(1001, 2005);\nif (result.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Process the jump path\n    for (auto& waypoint : result.GetWaypoints())\
      \ {\n        std::cout << \"Jump to position: \" << waypoint.x << \", \" <<\
      \ waypoint.y << \", \" << waypoint.z << std::endl;\n    }\n} else {\n    std::cerr\
      \ << \"No valid jump path found!\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on precomputed navigation meshes and assumes that the
    start and goal positions are within the same map. It may not handle dynamic obstacles
    well, as it uses static pathfinding data. Performance can be impacted if the start
    or goal points are far apart or in areas with sparse navigation data.
  warnings: Ensure that both start and goal parameters refer to valid nodes in the
    current map's navigation mesh; otherwise, the method will likely return an invalid
    path result. Avoid calling this method frequently in tight loops as it may cause
    performance degradation due to internal pathfinding computations.
