documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is currently present in the world
  description: The IsInWorld method checks if an Object instance is actively located
    within the game world, meaning it has been added to the world and is visible to
    players. This method is commonly used to verify the existence of objects such
    as players, creatures, or game objects within the game environment. It returns
    true when the object is in the world and false when it is not, typically indicating
    that the object has been removed from the world or hasn't been added yet. The
    method is essential for determining object state during gameplay operations and
    can be used to prevent accessing invalid memory references.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is currently in the world, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the object has been properly added to the game world and
    is visible to players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (object->IsInWorld()) {\n    // Object is in world, proceed with operations\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Object is not in world, handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is implemented as a simple check against the object's internal
    state flags. It does not perform any complex validation or memory checks, making
    it fast but potentially unreliable if used incorrectly. The method should be used
    carefully in scenarios where objects might be removed from the world during gameplay.
  warnings: Using this method without proper context can lead to accessing invalid
    memory references if the object has been removed from the world. It is recommended
    to use this method only when necessary and always ensure that the object is valid
    before calling it.
