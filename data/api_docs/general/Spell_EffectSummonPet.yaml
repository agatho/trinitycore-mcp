documentation:
  brief: Summon a pet for the caster using the spell's effect.
  description: The EffectSummonPet method handles the summoning of a pet through a
    spell effect, typically used in conjunction with pet summoning spells. This method
    is responsible for creating and managing the pet entity within the game world,
    including setting up the pet's initial attributes, behavior, and relationship
    with its owner. The method operates under the assumption that the spell has already
    been cast and that the necessary conditions for pet summoning are met, such as
    having a valid target or summoning position.

  - title: Basic Pet Summoning Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, 12345); // Assuming spell ID 12345 is
      a pet summoning spell

      spell->EffectSummonPet();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically requires the caster to be a player or creature with
    proper summoning capabilities. The method may involve additional logic for handling
    pet AI, positioning, and ownership relationships. It is often used in conjunction
    with other spell effects such as 'Summon Pet' or 'Summon Minion'.
  warnings: The method should only be called when the spell's conditions are met and
    the caster has sufficient resources to summon a pet. Improper usage may result
    in invalid pet behavior or game state issues.
