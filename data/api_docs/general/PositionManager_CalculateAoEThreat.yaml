  class: PositionManager
  method: CalculateAoEThreat
  signature: float PositionManager::CalculateAoEThreat(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the area of effect threat value for a given position.
  description: The CalculateAoEThreat method computes the threat generated by an area
    of effect spell or ability at a specified position. This method is typically used
    in combat calculations to determine how much threat a spell will generate on targets
    within its radius. The calculation considers factors such as spell power, target
    proximity, and threat modifiers. It returns a float value representing the total
    threat amount that would be generated by the AoE effect at the given location.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position index or identifier used to determine which area of
      effect threat calculation to perform. This parameter likely refers to a specific
      point in space or a predefined position within the game world.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated area of effect threat amount.
    Higher values indicate greater threat generation, which affects aggro and target
    selection for enemy units.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Threat Calculation
    code: "float threat = positionManager.CalculateAoEThreat(5); // Calculate threat\
      \ at position index 5\nif (threat > 100.0f)\n{\n    // Handle high threat scenario\n\
      \    printf(\"High threat area detected: %f\\n\", threat);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using AoE Threat in Combat Logic
    code: "PositionManager positionManager;\nint targetPosition = 12;\nfloat calculatedThreat\
      \ = positionManager.CalculateAoEThreat(targetPosition);\n\nif (calculatedThreat\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Apply threat to nearby enemies\n    for (auto& enemy :\
      \ nearbyEnemies)\n    {\n        enemy.AddThreat(calculatedThreat);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the game's AI and combat system.
    The position parameter may be an index into a predefined array of positions or
    a coordinate reference. Performance-wise, this calculation should be relatively
    lightweight as it's part of real-time combat processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the position index passed to this method is valid and within
    expected bounds to avoid undefined behavior. This method may not be thread-safe
    if used outside of the main game loop context.
