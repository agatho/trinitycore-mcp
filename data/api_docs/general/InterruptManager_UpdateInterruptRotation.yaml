documentation:
  brief: Updates the interrupt rotation state for all active interrupts in the manager.
  description: The UpdateInterruptRotation method is responsible for managing and
    updating the state of interrupt rotations within the InterruptManager. This method
    iterates through all registered interrupts, evaluates their current status, and
    updates their rotation states accordingly. It typically handles the logic for
    determining when an interrupt should be triggered, reset, or advanced in its rotation
    cycle. The method ensures that interrupt mechanics function correctly within the
    game's combat system by maintaining proper timing and sequencing of interrupt
    events.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptManager* interruptMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetInterruptManager();

      interruptMgr->UpdateInterruptRotation();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the game loop's update cycle to ensure
    timely processing of interrupt rotations. It may involve iterating through multiple
    interrupt entries and performing state transitions that could affect combat flow.
