  brief: Resurrects target player with aura effects applied.
  description: This method handles the resurrection process for a target player, applying
    specific aura effects during the resurrection. It typically occurs when a player
    is resurrected from death, either through direct resurrection spells or by applying
    a resurrection aura that restores health and mana. The method ensures proper handling
    of the resurrection mechanics within the game's context, including potential cooldowns,
    resource requirements, and aura applications.

  notes: Implementation requires careful handling of target player state and aura
    application. Performance considerations include potential delay in execution due
    to game mechanics processing.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method may lead to incorrect resurrection behavior
    or missing aura effects, potentially causing player state issues.
