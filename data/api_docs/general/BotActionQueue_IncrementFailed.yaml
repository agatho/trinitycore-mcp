documentation:
  brief: Increments the failed action counter for the bot action queue
  description: The IncrementFailed method increases the internal counter that tracks
    the number of failed actions within the bot action queue. This method is typically
    called when a bot action fails to execute successfully, allowing the system to
    monitor and potentially trigger fail-safe behaviors or logging mechanisms. The
    increment operation is usually thread-safe and may be used in conjunction with
    other queue management functions to maintain accurate statistics about bot performance
    and action success rates.

    code: 'BotActionQueue queue;

      queue.IncrementFailed();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an atomic counter to ensure thread safety
    in multi-threaded environments. It's commonly used in bot AI systems where tracking
    action failures is important for debugging and performance optimization.
