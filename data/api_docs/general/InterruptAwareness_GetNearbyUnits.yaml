  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: GetNearbyUnits
  signature: int InterruptAwareness::GetNearbyUnits() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of nearby units within the interrupt awareness range.
  description: The GetNearbyUnits method returns an integer representing the number
    of units (players or creatures) currently within the interrupt awareness range
    of the object instance. This functionality is typically used in AI behavior systems
    to determine how many targets are close enough to potentially be interrupted during
    spell casting or other time-sensitive actions. The method does not differentiate
    between friendly and hostile units, and it considers all units within the defined
    proximity radius. It's commonly used for interrupt logic in combat AI to decide
    whether an action should be interrupted based on nearby activity.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of nearby units found within the
    interrupt awareness range. Returns zero if no units are detected in range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "class MyAI : public ScriptedAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (me->GetNearbyUnits() > 0) {\n            // Perform\
      \ interrupt logic\n            DoInterrupt();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial query to find nearby units, which may have
    performance implications in high-density areas. The actual range and detection
    mechanics depend on the specific implementation of the InterruptAwareness class
    and its associated configuration values.
  warnings: The method assumes that the object instance has valid positioning data.
    If called on an invalid or unplaced unit, it may return unexpected results or
    cause undefined behavior.
