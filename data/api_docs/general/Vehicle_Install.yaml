  brief: Installs the vehicle into the game world, making it available for passengers
    to board and operate.
  description: The Vehicle::Install method initializes and registers a vehicle object
    within the TrinityCore game world. This process typically involves setting up
    the vehicle's entry points, establishing passenger interaction mechanics, and
    ensuring that the vehicle is properly integrated with the underlying movement
    and control systems. The method prepares the vehicle for use by players or NPCs,
    enabling boarding, mounting, and operation of the vehicle. It is commonly called
    during vehicle creation or activation phases within the game logic.

      // Vehicle is now ready for passengers to board'

  notes: This method should only be called after all vehicle properties have been
    properly initialized. The installation process may involve registering the vehicle
    with the game's object manager and setting up necessary callbacks for passenger
    interactions.
  warnings: Calling Install() on an already installed vehicle may result in undefined
    behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the vehicle is not already active before
    calling this method.
