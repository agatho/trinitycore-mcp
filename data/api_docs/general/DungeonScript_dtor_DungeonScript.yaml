documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DungeonScript instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The destructor for the DungeonScript class is responsible for cleaning
    up any resources allocated during the lifetime of the dungeon script instance.
    This includes releasing memory, unregistering callbacks, and ensuring proper shutdown
    of any associated game objects or systems. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, DungeonScripts are used to define custom behaviors for
    dungeon instances, such as event triggers, boss AI, and quest conditions. The
    destructor ensures that when a dungeon instance is completed or terminated, all
    script-related resources are properly freed to prevent memory leaks and maintain
    system stability.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of DungeonScript
    code: "class MyDungeonScript : public DungeonScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyDungeonScript()\
      \ {}\n    ~MyDungeonScript() override\n    {\n        // Cleanup code here\n\
      \    }\n};\n\n// When the dungeon instance ends, the destructor is automatically\
      \ called\nvoid OnDungeonComplete()\n{\n    // The DungeonScript instance will\
      \ be destroyed automatically\n    // and its destructor will be invoked\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a DungeonScript instance goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that any derived
    classes properly implement cleanup logic in their destructors, especially if they
    manage dynamic memory or register callbacks with the game engine.
