  signature: void Player::SetSemaphoreTeleportNear(bool semphsetting)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the semaphore for teleporting near the player's current location.
  description: This method controls whether the player can teleport to a nearby location
    during gameplay. It typically affects teleportation mechanics that are used in
    conjunction with other player actions or game events, such as when a player is
    in a specific state or condition that allows for teleportation near their current
    position. The semaphore setting determines if the player's teleportation behavior
    is enabled or disabled for nearby locations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetSemaphoreTeleportNear(true);

      // Enables teleportation near the player''s location'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method may be tied to internal game
    state flags or player condition checks. It should be used carefully in conjunction
    with other teleport-related methods and may not be directly accessible during
    certain gameplay states.
  warnings: This method might interfere with normal gameplay mechanics if used incorrectly,
    especially when combined with other teleportation functions. Care should be taken
    to ensure that the semaphore setting does not conflict with existing game state
    logic.
