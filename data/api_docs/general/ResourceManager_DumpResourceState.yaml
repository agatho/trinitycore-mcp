documentation:
  brief: Dumps the current state of all managed resources to the log output
  description: The DumpResourceState method provides diagnostic information by logging
    the complete state of all resources currently managed by the ResourceManager.
    This includes details such as resource identifiers, usage statistics, memory allocation
    status, and any pending operations. The method is typically used for debugging
    purposes during development or for monitoring resource consumption in production
    environments. It outputs information to the server's log system, making it useful
    for administrators and developers who need to track resource utilization patterns
    or identify potential leaks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debugging
    code: "void MyGameModule::OnServerUpdate()\n{\n    // Dump resource state every\
      \ 5 minutes\n    static uint32 lastDump = 0;\n    if (getMSTime() - lastDump\
      \ > 300000)\n    {\n        sResourceManager->DumpResourceState();\n       \
      \ lastDump = getMSTime();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full enumeration of all managed resources and may
    cause performance overhead during high-traffic periods. It should be used sparingly
    in production environments. The output is typically verbose and intended for developers
    or system administrators with access to the server logs.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently in production can significantly impact
    server performance due to the comprehensive nature of resource enumeration. Avoid
    using it in time-critical code paths or during peak player activity periods.
