  class: BattlegroundMap
  method: GetBattlegroundScript
  signature: const BattlegroundScript * BattlegroundMap::GetBattlegroundScript() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battleground script associated with this battleground map.
  description: The GetBattlegroundScript method returns a pointer to the BattlegroundScript
    object that defines the behavior and logic for the specific battleground instance.
    This script contains all the game rules, scoring systems, objectives, and event
    handlers that govern how the battleground operates. The method is typically used
    by the core system to access battleground-specific functionality during gameplay,
    such as handling player events, checking win conditions, or managing rewards.
    It ensures that each battleground type (like Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, etc.)
    has its own distinct behavior while maintaining a unified interface for the game
    engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the BattlegroundScript object associated with this battleground
    map. Returns nullptr if no script is assigned or if the map is not a valid battleground
    instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BattlegroundScript const* bgScript = battlegroundMap->GetBattlegroundScript();\n\
      if (bgScript)\n{\n    // Use the script for battleground logic\n    bgScript->OnPlayerJoin(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Script Validity
    code: "const BattlegroundScript* script = map->GetBattlegroundScript();\nif (script\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Safe to use the script\n    sLog->outString(\"Battleground\
      \ type: %s\", script->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      No battleground script found for map %u\", map->GetId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    manage battleground state and events. The returned pointer should not be modified
    or deleted, as it's managed by the system. Performance-wise, this is a fast lookup
    operation that simply returns a cached pointer.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value means the battleground is active
    or ready for play. The script may exist but the battleground might still be in
    initialization or cleanup phase. Always validate the battleground state before
    using the script for gameplay logic.
