  signature: bool LeaverInfo::operator==(const LeaverInfo & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two LeaverInfo objects for equality based on their internal data
    members.
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    LeaverInfo object and another LeaverInfo object provided as a parameter. It returns
    true if all corresponding data members of both objects are equal, and false otherwise.
    This comparison is typically used to determine whether two leaver records represent
    the same player or event in the context of player disconnection tracking within
    TrinityCore's game systems. The method does not consider any external state or
    dynamic factors; it only compares the stored data values.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The LeaverInfo object to compare against this instance. This parameter
      must be a valid LeaverInfo object, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns true if all data members of the two LeaverInfo objects are equal;
    returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two LeaverInfo objects
    code: 'LeaverInfo leaver1;

      LeaverInfo leaver2;

      bool isEqual = (leaver1 == leaver2); // Returns true if both objects have identical
      data members'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is commonly used in container comparisons such as std::set
    or std::map when storing LeaverInfo objects. Since it's a comparison operator,
    it should be implemented efficiently to avoid performance bottlenecks during sorting
    or searching operations.
