  signature: void SmartScript::OnReset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the SmartScript AI system to its initial state, clearing all active
    events and restoring default behavior.
  description: The OnReset method is a critical component of the SmartScript AI framework
    in TrinityCore. It resets the AI system to its original state by clearing any
    active events, stopping ongoing actions, and reinitializing internal state variables.
    This method ensures that when an AI-controlled creature or game object is reset
    (such as after combat ends or during a respawn), it returns to a clean slate where
    all scripted behaviors are properly initialized. The reset process typically occurs
    automatically during certain AI transitions or when explicitly invoked by the
    core engine, ensuring consistent behavior across different game states and preventing
    lingering script states from affecting future interactions.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::Reset()\n{\n    // Reset the SmartScript AI system\n\
      \    m_SmartScript->OnReset();\n}\n\n// Called when creature respawns or combat\
      \ ends"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    AI state transitions. Developers should not normally need to call this directly
    unless implementing custom AI reset logic. The method ensures all event timers
    and active scripts are cleared, preventing memory leaks or unexpected behavior
    in scripted creatures.
  warnings: Calling OnReset() manually inappropriately may cause loss of current AI
    state and could lead to inconsistent behavior if the AI is mid-execution. This
    method should only be used when a complete reset of the SmartScript system is
    required.
