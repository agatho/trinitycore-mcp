documentation:
  brief: Sends a cooldown clear message to the player's client for the specified spell
    cooldowns.
  description: The SendClearCooldowns method is responsible for transmitting a network
    message to the player's client, instructing it to clear specific spell cooldowns
    from the user interface. This functionality is typically used when a player's
    cooldowns are reset or modified through game mechanics such as item effects, buffs,
    or spell modifications. The method operates on a provided list of cooldown identifiers
    and ensures that the client's UI reflects the updated cooldown state. It is part
    of the SpellHistory class which manages the tracking and synchronization of spell
    cooldowns between server and client.
  parameters:
  - name: cooldowns
    description: An integer reference representing the identifier or index of the
      cooldown to be cleared. This value typically corresponds to a specific spell
      or ability's cooldown entry within the SpellHistory system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing a Single Cooldown
    code: 'SpellHistory* history = player->GetSpellHistory();

      int cooldownId = 12345;

      history->SendClearCooldowns(cooldownId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Multiple Cooldowns in Loop
    code: "SpellHistory* history = player->GetSpellHistory();\nint cooldowns[] = {1001,\
      \ 1002, 1003};\nfor (int cooldown : cooldowns) {\n    history->SendClearCooldowns(cooldown);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    spell cooldowns need to be synchronized with the client. Developers should ensure
    that the cooldown identifier passed is valid and corresponds to an actual tracked
    cooldown in the SpellHistory system to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect or invalid cooldown identifiers may cause undefined behavior
    on the client side. Ensure that cooldown IDs are properly validated before calling
    this method, especially when dealing with dynamic cooldown modifications.
