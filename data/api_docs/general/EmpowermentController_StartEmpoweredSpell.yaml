  class: EmpowermentController
  method: StartEmpoweredSpell
  signature: void EmpowermentController::StartEmpoweredSpell(int spellId, EmpowermentLevel
    targetLevel, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an empowered spell effect with the specified target level and spell
    ID.
  description: The StartEmpoweredSpell method activates a spell empowerment state
    for a player or creature, applying a specific empowerment level to a given spell.
    This method is typically used in conjunction with the EmpowermentController to
    manage spell enhancement mechanics within TrinityCore's game system. The method
    modifies internal spell state tracking and may trigger visual or auditory effects
    depending on the empowerment level. It requires that the target spell ID exists
    in the spell database and that the empowerment level is valid for the current
    context.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be empowered. Must correspond
      to a valid spell entry in the database.
  - name: targetLevel
    description: The empowerment level to apply to the spell. Defines the strength
      and effects of the empowered version.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer that will store the resulting empowerment state
      or effect value after processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Empowerment Activation
    code: 'EmpowermentController controller;

      int result = 0;

      controller.StartEmpoweredSpell(12345, EmpowermentLevel::LEVEL_3, &result);

      // The spell with ID 12345 is now empowered to level 3, and result contains
      the empowerment value.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target spell has already been validated and
    registered in the game's spell system. It does not perform any validation on the
    spell ID or empowerment level internally; such checks should be performed before
    calling this method. The 'target' parameter is modified directly, so ensure it
    points to a valid memory location.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the spellId or targetLevel parameters may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the spell exists in the database and that
    the empowerment level is supported by the current game mechanics. Modifying the
    'target' pointer without proper initialization can cause memory corruption.
