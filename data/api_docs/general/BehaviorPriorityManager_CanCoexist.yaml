  signature: bool BehaviorPriorityManager::CanCoexist(Strategy * a, Strategy * b)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether two behavior strategies can coexist without conflict in
    the AI system.
  description: The CanCoexist method evaluates whether two given Strategy objects
    can operate simultaneously within the BehaviorPriorityManager's framework. This
    method is crucial for managing AI behavior prioritization and preventing conflicting
    strategies from being active at the same time. It typically checks for compatibility
    based on strategy priorities, types, or other internal constraints defined by
    the behavior system. The result helps the AI system decide whether to allow both
    strategies to run concurrently or to resolve conflicts by disabling one of them.
  parameters:
  - name: a
    description: First Strategy object to evaluate for coexistence compatibility
  - name: b
    description: Second Strategy object to evaluate for coexistence compatibility
  returns: Returns true if the two strategies can operate simultaneously without conflict;
    returns false if they are incompatible and cannot coexist.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Strategy Compatibility
    code: "Strategy* strategyA = new CombatStrategy();\nStrategy* strategyB = new\
      \ MovementStrategy();\nbool canCoexist = behaviorManager->CanCoexist(strategyA,\
      \ strategyB);\nif (canCoexist) {\n    // Both strategies can run together\n\
      \    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Strategies can coexist\");\n} else {\n    // Strategies\
      \ conflict and cannot run simultaneously\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Strategies\
      \ cannot coexist\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI strategy activation or deactivation
    to ensure no conflicting behaviors are enabled. It may involve checking strategy
    priorities, behavior types, or other internal constraints that determine compatibility.
