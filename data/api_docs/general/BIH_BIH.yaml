documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BIH (Bounding Interval Hierarchy) data structure for spatial
    partitioning and collision detection.
  description: The BIH constructor initializes a new Bounding Interval Hierarchy data
    structure, which is used for efficient spatial partitioning and collision detection
    in the TrinityCore world server. This structure organizes objects in a hierarchical
    tree format based on their bounding volumes, allowing for fast intersection tests
    and spatial queries. The BIH is commonly used for managing game object placement,
    player visibility calculations, and efficient collision detection across large
    worlds. It provides O(log n) lookup times for spatial queries and supports dynamic
    insertion and removal of objects within the hierarchy.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BIH instance
    code: 'BIH bihInstance;

      // The constructor automatically initializes the BIH structure

      // Ready for use in spatial queries and collision detection'
    language: cpp
  notes: The BIH implementation is designed to be thread-safe for read operations,
    though modifications should be protected by appropriate locking mechanisms. Performance
    is optimal when objects are inserted in batches rather than individually. The
    structure automatically rebalances during insertion to maintain O(log n) query
    performance.
  warnings: Do not use BIH instances without proper initialization; the constructor
    handles all necessary setup but assumes the object will be used for spatial queries.
    Avoid frequent insertions/deletions in performance-critical code paths as they
    may cause tree rebalancing overhead.
