  method: ExecutePendingSpellCastRequest
  signature: void Player::ExecutePendingSpellCastRequest()
documentation:
  brief: Executes a pending spell cast request that was previously queued for the
    player.
  description: The ExecutePendingSpellCastRequest method processes and executes a
    spell cast that has been queued but not yet executed. This typically occurs when
    a spell is initiated by the player but cannot be immediately cast due to game
    state constraints such as being in combat, having insufficient resources, or other
    validation checks. The method ensures that the pending spell request is properly
    handled according to the game's spell casting mechanics and player state. It is
    usually invoked internally by the core system after resolving any blocking conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerSpellCast(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->HasPendingSpellCast())\n\
      \    {\n        player->ExecutePendingSpellCastRequest();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    spell cast conditions are met. Developers should not generally call this directly
    unless implementing custom spell handling logic or debugging spell execution flow.
  warnings: Calling this method manually without proper validation may result in unexpected
    behavior or game state inconsistencies. It's important to ensure that all preconditions
    for spell casting have been properly resolved before invoking this function.
