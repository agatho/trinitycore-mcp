  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: RegisterBot
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::RegisterBot(Player * bot, BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a bot player and its associated AI component with the interrupt
    coordinator.
  description: The RegisterBot method integrates a bot player and its corresponding
    BotAI instance into the InterruptCoordinatorFixed system. This allows the coordinator
    to manage and process interrupt-related events for the registered bot, ensuring
    proper handling of abilities, spells, or actions that may be interrupted during
    gameplay. The method typically initializes internal tracking structures for the
    bot's AI behavior and ensures synchronization between the player entity and its
    artificial intelligence component within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot to be registered.
      Must not be null.
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object associated with the bot player. Must
      not be null and should correspond to the same bot instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Registration
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      BotAI* myBotAI = ...; // Assume initialized AI

      interruptCoordinator->RegisterBot(myBot, myBotAI);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during bot initialization or when a new
    bot is added to the game world. It assumes that both Player and BotAI objects
    are fully constructed and valid before registration.
