  method: WaypointPathEnded
  signature: void CreatureAI::WaypointPathEnded(int param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature's waypoint path has been fully traversed and the path
    is complete.
  description: The WaypointPathEnded method is invoked by the TrinityCore AI system
    when a CreatureAI object finishes executing its assigned waypoint path. This method
    serves as a callback mechanism that allows custom AI logic to be executed upon
    completion of a path traversal, such as triggering events, resetting the creature's
    state, or initiating a new behavior sequence. It is typically used in conjunction
    with waypoint-based movement systems where creatures follow predefined paths through
    the game world. The method does not take any parameters and should be overridden
    in derived AI classes to implement custom behavior upon path completion.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void WaypointPathEnded(int\
      \ /*param0*/, int /*param1*/) override\n    {\n        // Custom logic when\
      \ path ends\n        me->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_IMMUNE_TO_PC);\n\
      \        Talk(0); // Speak a message\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Path Completion with State Reset
    code: "class PatrolGuardAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void WaypointPathEnded(int\
      \ /*param0*/, int /*param1*/) override\n    {\n        // Reset patrol state\n\
      \        me->SetWalk(false);\n        me->SetHomePosition(me->GetPosition());\n\
      \        me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveTargetedHome();\n        \n        // Optionally\
      \ trigger quest completion or other events\n        if (Creature* questGiver\
      \ = me->FindNearestCreature(12345, 10.0f))\n        {\n            questGiver->AI()->Talk(1);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI interface and is automatically called
    by the core AI system when a waypoint path completes. Developers should ensure
    that any custom logic implemented in this method does not block or cause long-running
    operations, as it may affect overall performance. The parameters are present in
    the signature but are not used within the base implementation.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the AI system; it is intended
    for internal use only. Overriding this method without proper consideration of
    game state can lead to unexpected behavior or infinite loops if not handled correctly.
