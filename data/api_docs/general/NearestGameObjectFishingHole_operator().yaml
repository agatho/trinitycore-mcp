  method: operator()
  signature: bool NearestGameObjectFishingHole::operator()(int * go)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the GUID of the nearest fishing hole game object.
  description: The NearestGameObjectFishingHole::operator() method is used to locate
    the closest game object that represents a fishing hole within the player's current
    zone. It searches through all valid fishing hole game objects in the vicinity
    and returns the GUID of the one with the shortest distance to the caller. This
    method is typically used by the AI or game logic to determine where a player should
    attempt to fish. The method modifies the provided integer pointer to store the
    GUID of the found fishing hole, or leaves it unchanged if no valid fishing hole
    is found within range.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid fishing hole was found and its GUID was stored
    in the provided integer pointer; otherwise returns false if no suitable fishing
    hole exists in the area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearest fishing hole
    code: "int fishingHoleGUID = 0;\nif (NearestGameObjectFishingHole()(\\&fishingHoleGUID))\
      \ {\n    // A fishing hole was found, use the GUID\n    printf(\"Found fishing\
      \ hole with GUID: %d\\n\", fishingHoleGUID);\n} else {\n    // No fishing hole\
      \ found nearby\n    printf(\"No fishing hole found nearby.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a functor class and should be used in contexts where
    game object queries are needed for AI or player actions. It assumes that the calling
    context has valid access to the game world's object database and that the current
    zone contains fishing hole objects.
  warnings: Ensure that the integer pointer passed to this method is properly initialized
    or cleared before use, as the method will overwrite its value upon success. Do
    not assume that a returned GUID is always valid for immediate use without checking
    if the object still exists in the game world.
