documentation:
  brief: Executes custom logic when a player enters an area trigger
  description: The OnTrigger method is a virtual callback function that gets invoked
    whenever a Player enters an AreaTrigger. This method allows developers to implement
    custom behavior such as teleporting players, triggering quests, applying effects,
    or performing any game logic specific to the area trigger. The method receives
    both the player who entered the trigger and the area trigger entry data, enabling
    contextual actions based on the trigger's properties. Return true to allow normal
    processing of the area trigger, or false to prevent default behavior such as teleportation
    or quest activation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who entered the area trigger. This parameter
      is never null during the callback execution.
  - name: trigger
    description: Pointer to the AreaTriggerEntry structure containing metadata about
      the area trigger that was activated. Includes properties like trigger ID, position,
      and associated quest or spell data.
  returns: Returns true to allow normal processing of the area trigger (e.g., teleportation,
    quest activation), or false to prevent default behavior and handle the trigger
    entirely within custom code.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Area Trigger Handler
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerScript : public AreaTriggerScript\n{\npublic:\n    bool\
      \ OnTrigger(Player* player, const AreaTriggerEntry* trigger) override\n    {\n\
      \        // Teleport player to a specific location\n        player->TeleportTo(1234,\
      \ 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f);\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Area Trigger with Quest Activation
    code: "class QuestAreaTriggerScript : public AreaTriggerScript\n{\npublic:\n \
      \   bool OnTrigger(Player* player, const AreaTriggerEntry* trigger) override\n\
      \    {\n        // Only activate quest if player has required item\n       \
      \ if (player->HasItem(5678))\n        {\n            player->AddQuest(9012);\n\
      \            return true;\n        }\n        return false; // Prevent default\
      \ behavior\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from the game's main update loop and should avoid heavy
    computations or blocking operations. The AreaTriggerEntry data is read-only during
    this callback, so modifications to trigger properties will not affect the actual
    area trigger behavior.
  warnings: Do not call methods that modify the player's state (like TeleportTo) within
    this function unless necessary, as it may cause unexpected behavior if the player
    is already in motion. Also, returning false does not guarantee that no further
    processing occurs; some default actions might still happen depending on how the
    area trigger is configured.
