  method: Remove
  signature: void Aura::Remove(AuraRemoveMode removeMode)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the aura from the target with the specified removal mode.
  description: The Remove method is used to remove an aura from its target. It takes
    an AuraRemoveMode parameter that determines how the aura should be removed, such
    as by expiration, cancellation, or dispel effects. This method handles the cleanup
    of aura effects and ensures proper notifications are sent to affected units. The
    removal process may trigger callbacks or events depending on the removal mode
    specified.
  parameters:
  - name: removeMode
    description: Specifies the manner in which the aura should be removed. Valid values
      include AURA_REMOVE_BY_DEFAULT, AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE, AURA_REMOVE_BY_CANCEL,
      AURA_REMOVE_BY_DISPEL, and others. The mode affects how the aura's effects are
      processed and whether any associated events are triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Aura by Expiration
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->Remove(AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Aura on Dispel
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nAura* aura = target->GetAura(67890);\nif (aura)\n\
      {\n    aura->Remove(AURA_REMOVE_BY_DISPEL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should not be called directly from within an aura application
    or removal handler, as it may cause recursion issues. The removal process updates
    the aura's internal state and may trigger callbacks in the target unit.
  warnings: Calling Remove on a null aura pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Always verify that the aura exists before calling this method. Avoid removing
    auras from different threads without proper synchronization.
