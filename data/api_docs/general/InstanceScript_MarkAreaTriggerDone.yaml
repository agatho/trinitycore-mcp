  method: MarkAreaTriggerDone
  signature: void InstanceScript::MarkAreaTriggerDone(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Marks an area trigger as completed within the instance script.
  description: The MarkAreaTriggerDone method is used to mark a specific area trigger
    with the given ID as having been activated or completed. This functionality is
    typically employed in instance scripts to track player progress through various
    triggers or events within a dungeon or raid encounter. The method updates internal
    tracking data to reflect that the specified area trigger has been processed, which
    can be queried later using related methods such as IsAreaTriggerDone. This mechanism
    allows for complex event sequencing and conditional logic based on trigger activation
    states.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the area trigger to mark as done. This ID
      corresponds to the area trigger's entry in the database and must be a valid,
      registered trigger within the instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Script
    code: "class BossInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnPlayerEnter(Player* player) override\n    {\n        // Mark area trigger\
      \ 12345 as done when player enters\n        MarkAreaTriggerDone(12345);\n  \
      \  }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Conditional Logic
    code: "void BossInstanceScript::OnCreatureKilled(Creature* creature) override\n\
      {\n    if (creature->GetEntry() == 12345)\n    {\n        // Mark area trigger\
      \ done after killing specific creature\n        MarkAreaTriggerDone(67890);\n\
      \        \n        // Later check if it was done\n        if (IsAreaTriggerDone(67890))\n\
      \        {\n            // Perform additional actions\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the instance script's state management system and
    should be called during appropriate event handlers such as OnPlayerEnter, OnCreatureKilled,
    or other relevant callbacks. The internal tracking mechanism uses a bitmask or
    similar structure to store trigger completion states, so performance impact is
    minimal for typical usage patterns.
  warnings: Ensure that the area trigger ID passed to this method corresponds to an
    actual registered trigger in the instance. Passing invalid IDs may result in undefined
    behavior or silently ignored operations. Also note that this method does not validate
    whether the trigger has already been marked as done, so calling it multiple times
    for the same ID is safe but unnecessary.
