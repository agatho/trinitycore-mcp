  signature: bool TrinityCorePriority::operator!=(const TrinityCorePriority & other)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two TrinityCorePriority objects for inequality and returns true
    if they are not equal.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this TrinityCorePriority
    instance and another TrinityCorePriority object to determine whether they are
    not equal. This comparison is typically based on the internal priority values
    or identifiers of the objects. In the context of TrinityCore, which is a World
    of Warcraft emulator, such a comparison might be used when managing object priorities
    in systems like AI behavior, quest handling, or event scheduling where ordering
    and precedence matter. The method is const, meaning it does not modify either
    object during execution.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: A constant reference to another TrinityCorePriority object that this
      instance will be compared against for inequality.
  returns: 'Returns a boolean value: true if the two TrinityCorePriority objects are
    not equal; false if they are equal. The equality check is based on internal priority
    data members of the class.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: 'TrinityCorePriority prio1(5);

      TrinityCorePriority prio2(10);

      bool result = (prio1 != prio2); // Returns true because 5 is not equal to 10'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "TrinityCorePriority currentPrio(7);\nTrinityCorePriority targetPrio(7);\n\
      if (currentPrio != targetPrio) {\n    // Do something if priorities are different\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Priorities differ\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Do something\
      \ if priorities are the same\n    std::cout << \"Priorities match\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using a direct member-wise comparison,
    which means that it compares all relevant fields of the TrinityCorePriority class.
    It's important to ensure that the underlying data members used in the comparison
    are properly initialized and consistent across instances for meaningful results.
