  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecuteShamanInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteShamanInterrupt(BotAI * ai,
    ::Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts a target unit's spell casting if the bot is a shaman and the spell
    is interruptible.
  description: The ExecuteShamanInterrupt method checks whether the provided BotAI
    instance represents a shaman character and attempts to interrupt the specified
    target unit's current spell cast. This action is typically used in AI logic for
    shaman bots to break enemy spell casts, especially when the bot has an appropriate
    interrupt ability such as Wind Shear or Earth Shock. The method evaluates if the
    target is casting a spell that can be interrupted, and if so, triggers the interrupt
    mechanism. It returns an ActionResult indicating success or failure of the interrupt
    attempt.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance representing the shaman bot performing
      the interrupt action.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is currently casting a spell and
      may be interrupted.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell being cast by the target unit, used to determine
      if it's interruptible.
  returns: An ActionResult enum value indicating whether the interrupt was successful
    or failed. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, or other status codes depending
    on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteShamanInterrupt
    code: "if (SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteShamanInterrupt(ai, target, spellId) ==\
      \ ActionResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    ai->GetBot()->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n\
      \    ai->GetBot()->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI instance is properly initialized and represents
    a shaman class. The spellId parameter must correspond to an actual spell being
    cast by the target unit for the interrupt to be valid. Performance-wise, this
    function should be lightweight as it's intended for use in AI decision-making
    loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is actually casting a spell before calling
    this method; otherwise, the interrupt may fail or cause unintended behavior. Also,
    verify that the bot has sufficient mana and cooldowns to perform the interrupt
    ability.
