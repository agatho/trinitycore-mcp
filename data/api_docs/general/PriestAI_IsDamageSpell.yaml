  class: PriestAI
  method: IsDamageSpell
  signature: bool PriestAI::IsDamageSpell(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified spell ID corresponds to a damage-dealing spell
    for the Priest class.
  description: 'The IsDamageSpell method evaluates whether a given spell ID represents
    a damage-dealing spell within the context of the Priest AI behavior. This function
    is typically used by the PriestAI class to distinguish between harmful spells
    (like Mind Blast or Shadow Word: Pain) and supportive or utility spells (such
    as Power Word: Shield or Heal). The method checks against an internal list or
    set of known damage spells for the Priest class, ensuring that the AI can appropriately
    prioritize and select spells during combat. It is essential for proper spell selection
    logic in scripted priest AI implementations.'
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be evaluated. This ID must
      correspond to a valid spell defined in the TrinityCore spell database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell ID is classified as a damage spell
    for the Priest class; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (priestAI->IsDamageSpell(8092)) {\n    // Handle damage spell logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Mind Blast is a damage spell\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Selection Logic
    code: "void PriestAI::SelectSpell() {\n    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SPELLS; ++i)\
      \ {\n        if (IsDamageSpell(spellIds[i])) {\n            // Prioritize damage\
      \ spells\n            CastSpell(spellIds[i]);\n            break;\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on an internal mapping or lookup table of spell IDs that
    are categorized as damage spells for the Priest class. It assumes that all relevant
    spell IDs have been properly registered in the game's spell database and that
    the AI module has access to this data.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId is valid and corresponds to an actual
    spell in the TrinityCore database; invalid or unknown spell IDs may lead to incorrect
    behavior or undefined results.
