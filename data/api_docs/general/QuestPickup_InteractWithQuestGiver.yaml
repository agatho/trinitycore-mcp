  class: QuestPickup
  method: InteractWithQuestGiver
  signature: bool QuestPickup::InteractWithQuestGiver(Player * bot, uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates interaction with a quest giver NPC for the specified player bot.
  description: The InteractWithQuestGiver method handles the process of a player bot
    interacting with a quest giver NPC in the World of Warcraft environment. It manages
    the necessary steps to begin or continue a quest interaction, including validating
    the quest giver's existence and ensuring proper communication between the bot
    and the game server. This method is typically used within AI scripts or quest
    automation systems to facilitate quest progression for automated characters. The
    method returns true upon successful initiation of the interaction, or false if
    the interaction fails due to invalid parameters or other issues.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will interact
      with the quest giver. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver NPC. This value must
      correspond to an existing NPC in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the interaction with the quest giver was successfully initiated,
    false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid GUID, missing NPC, or other
    interaction errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Interaction
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid player instance\nuint32 questGiverGuid\
      \ = 12345;\nbool success = QuestPickup::InteractWithQuestGiver(bot, questGiverGuid);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest interaction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Interaction with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nuint32 questGiverGuid = 12345;\nif (questGiverGuid\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // Handle invalid GUID\n    return false;\n}\n\nbool result\
      \ = QuestPickup::InteractWithQuestGiver(bot, questGiverGuid);\nif (!result)\n\
      {\n    // Log error or retry logic\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to interact\
      \ with quest giver %u\", questGiverGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player bot is within range of the quest giver
    and that the necessary game state is valid for interaction. It may internally
    perform checks such as verifying if the NPC exists, checking if the bot can interact
    with it, and ensuring proper quest state transitions.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided questGiverGuid corresponds to a valid NPC in
    the world; otherwise, the method will likely fail. Also, be cautious when calling
    this method from different threads, as it may not be thread-safe depending on
    internal implementation details.
