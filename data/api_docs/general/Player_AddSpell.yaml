  brief: Adds a spell to the player's spell book
  description: The AddSpell method adds a specified spell to the player's spell book,
    allowing the player to learn and use the spell. This method handles various aspects
    of spell learning including activation status, learning behavior, and dependency
    management. The method supports multiple parameters that control how the spell
    is added and managed within the game system.

      exists in the game database.

    description: Controls whether the spell is active or inactive upon addition. If
      true, the spell will be active; if false, it will remain inactive.

      spell will be marked as learned and available for use.

      If true, the spell will be considered dependent on other spells.

  - name: trait
    description: Controls whether the spell is a trait or not. If true, the spell
      will be considered a trait and may have special handling.

    spells through game events. It should be used carefully as it may affect the player's
    spell book and skill system.

    may cause issues with spell learning and skill progression. Ensure that spell
