  class: Guardian
  method: InitSummon
  signature: void Guardian::InitSummon(int * summoner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a guardian summon with the provided summoner reference.
  description: The InitSummon method sets up the internal state of a Guardian object
    when it is summoned by another unit. This method typically configures the guardian's
    relationship with its summoner, including setting the summoner reference, initializing
    ownership flags, and establishing the proper faction and combat behavior. It ensures
    that the guardian behaves correctly within the game world as a summoned creature
    under the control of the summoning unit.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to the unit that summoned this guardian. This parameter defines
      the owner of the guardian and determines its behavior, faction, and combat actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guardian Summon Initialization
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = new Guardian();

      Player* player = ...; // A valid player instance

      int* summonerRef = reinterpret_cast<int*>(player);

      guardian->InitSummon(summonerRef);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during the creation of summoned
    creatures. Developers should ensure that the summoner parameter points to a valid
    unit object before calling this method. The method does not perform any validation
    on the summoner reference, so it's important to verify its validity in the calling
    code.
  warnings: Calling InitSummon with an invalid or null summoner pointer can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate that the summoner parameter refers
    to a valid game object before invoking this method.
