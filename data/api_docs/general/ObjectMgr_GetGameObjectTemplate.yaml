  brief: Retrieves the game object template data for a specified entry ID
  description: The GetGameObjectTemplate method fetches the template information for
    a game object based on its unique entry identifier. This template contains static
    properties and configuration data that define how the game object behaves in the
    world. The method returns a pointer to an internal structure containing the template
    data, which is typically used by the game engine to instantiate and manage game
    objects. The returned pointer should be treated as read-only and must not be modified
    directly. If no template exists for the given entry ID, the method may return
    nullptr or a default template, depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer representing the game object template data.
    Returns nullptr if no template is found for the specified entry ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const int* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(176542);\nif\
      \ (goTemplate != nullptr) {\n    // Use the template data\n    printf(\"Found\
      \ game object template with entry %d\\n\", 176542);\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      No template found for entry %d\\n\", 176542);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a cached data structure that is populated during server
    startup and loading phases. The returned pointer remains valid throughout the
    server's runtime, but should not be modified. Performance is optimized through
    internal caching mechanisms.
  warnings: Do not modify the data pointed to by the return value as it represents
    shared template data. Accessing invalid entry IDs may result in undefined behavior
    or null pointer returns.
