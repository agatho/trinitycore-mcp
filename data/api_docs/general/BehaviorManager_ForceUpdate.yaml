  class: BehaviorManager
  method: ForceUpdate
  signature: void BehaviorManager::ForceUpdate()
documentation:
  brief: Immediately triggers an update cycle for all managed behaviors in the BehaviorManager.
  description: The ForceUpdate method initiates an immediate evaluation and execution
    of all behaviors currently managed by the BehaviorManager instance. This method
    bypasses normal update scheduling and forces all registered behaviors to process
    their logic instantly. It is typically used when external events require immediate
    behavioral response without waiting for the next scheduled update tick. The method
    does not return any value and operates on the current state of all behaviors,
    potentially modifying their internal states or triggering actions based on current
    conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ForceUpdate Usage
    code: 'BehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = player->GetBehaviorManager();

      behaviorMgr->ForceUpdate();'
    language: cpp
  - title: ForceUpdate in Response to Event
    code: "void OnPlayerKilledUnit(Player* player, Unit* target)\n{\n    BehaviorManager*\
      \ behaviorMgr = player->GetBehaviorManager();\n    if (behaviorMgr)\n    {\n\
      \        // Immediately re-evaluate all behaviors after killing a unit\n   \
      \     behaviorMgr->ForceUpdate();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used sparingly as it can impact performance if called
    too frequently. It's particularly useful in scenarios where immediate behavioral
    response is required, such as after player actions or environmental changes that
    affect AI decision-making.
  warnings: Calling ForceUpdate too often can cause performance degradation due to
    repeated behavior evaluations. Avoid calling this method in tight loops or high-frequency
    event handlers without proper throttling mechanisms.
