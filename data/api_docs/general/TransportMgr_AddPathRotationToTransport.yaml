  class: TransportMgr
  method: AddPathRotationToTransport
  signature: void TransportMgr::AddPathRotationToTransport(int transportEntry, int
    timeSeg, const TransportRotationEntry * node)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a rotation node to a transport's path at the specified time segment.
  description: The AddPathRotationToTransport method integrates a TransportRotationEntry
    into the path of a specific transport vehicle identified by its entry ID. This
    function is used during transport initialization or modification to define how
    the transport rotates at different points along its movement path. The timeSeg
    parameter specifies the time segment (typically in milliseconds) where this rotation
    should be applied, and the node parameter provides the actual rotation data including
    yaw, pitch, and roll values. This method is essential for creating realistic transport
    behavior such as ships tilting or vehicles rotating during movement.
  parameters:
  - name: transportEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the transport vehicle to which
      the rotation will be added. This corresponds to the entry field in the game's
      transport template tables.
  - name: timeSeg
    description: The time segment (in milliseconds) along the transport's path where
      this rotation should be applied. This determines when during the transport's
      journey the specified rotation takes effect.
  - name: node
    description: A pointer to a TransportRotationEntry structure containing the rotation
      data (yaw, pitch, roll) that will be applied to the transport at the specified
      time segment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Rotation Node to a Ship Transport
    code: 'TransportRotationEntry rotationNode;

      rotationNode.yaw = M_PI / 4; // 45 degrees

      rotationNode.pitch = 0.0f;

      rotationNode.roll = 0.0f;


      TransportMgr::instance()->AddPathRotationToTransport(181654, 2000, &rotationNode);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during transport initialization or path modification.
    The timeSeg values must be properly ordered to ensure correct sequence of rotations
    along the transport's path. This function does not validate whether the transport
    exists or if the time segment is within valid bounds.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid transportEntry may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the TransportRotationEntry pointer is valid and not null
    before calling. Incorrect timeSeg values can cause rotation timing issues during
    transport movement.
