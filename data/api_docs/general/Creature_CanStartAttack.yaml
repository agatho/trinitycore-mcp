  method: CanStartAttack
  signature: bool Creature::CanStartAttack(const int * u, bool force) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature can initiate an attack against a target.
  description: The CanStartAttack method evaluates whether a creature is capable of
    beginning combat with a specified target. This method checks various conditions
    including the creature's current state, target's validity, and game mechanics
    such as faction relationships. It typically returns true when the creature can
    start attacking, false otherwise. The method is commonly used in AI scripts to
    control creature behavior during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: u
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's unit ID or identifier.
      This parameter usually refers to a player or creature that the creature might
      attack.
  - name: force
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to force the attack regardless of
      normal conditions. When true, bypasses typical restrictions and allows immediate
      attack initiation.
  returns: Returns true if the creature can start attacking the target, false otherwise.
    The method may return false due to various conditions such as invalid target,
    creature being in combat, or target being immune to attack.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->CanStartAttack(&targetId, false)) {\n    // Start attacking\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Force attack example
    code: "if (creature->CanStartAttack(&targetId, true)) {\n    // Force attack regardless\
      \ of normal conditions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in creature AI scripts to determine when a
    creature should initiate combat. It may be called multiple times per frame depending
    on the game mechanics and AI implementation. The method does not actually start
    the attack; it only determines if the attack can begin.
  warnings: The method might return false even if the target is valid, due to creature
    state or faction restrictions. Care must be taken when using force parameter as
    it may bypass important game mechanics.
