  signature: bool UnlockedAzeriteEssence::operator==(const UnlockedAzeriteEssence
    & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two UnlockedAzeriteEssence objects for equality based on their internal
    data members.
  description: The operator== method performs a comparison between this UnlockedAzeriteEssence
    instance and another UnlockedAzeriteEssence object to determine if they are equal.
    This comparison typically involves checking the underlying data members such as
    the Azerite essence ID, level, and any associated flags or states that define
    the essence's unlocked status. The method is commonly used in game logic where
    it's necessary to verify whether two azerite essences represent the same item
    with identical properties. It ensures consistency when managing player collections
    of unlocked azerite essences within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The UnlockedAzeriteEssence object to compare against this instance.
  returns: Returns true if both UnlockedAzeriteEssence objects have identical internal
    data members, indicating they represent the same unlocked azerite essence. Returns
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check
    code: 'UnlockedAzeriteEssence essence1;

      UnlockedAzeriteEssence essence2;

      bool isEqual = (essence1 == essence2); // Compares two azerite essences for
      equality'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional logic
    code: "if (playerAzeriteEssence == targetAzeriteEssence)\n{\n    // Player already\
      \ has this essence unlocked\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You already have this azerite\
      \ essence unlocked.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is likely implemented using member-wise comparison of the essential
    data fields. It's important to note that in TrinityCore, equality comparisons
    for game objects often involve checking not just the core properties but also
    any associated database identifiers or state flags to ensure accurate matching.
