documentation:
  brief: Records an emote action performed by the player in the social manager.
  description: The RecordEmote method logs a specific emote type executed by the player
    within the game's social system. This function is typically invoked when a player
    performs an emote such as waving, laughing, or other predefined gestures. The
    method updates internal tracking mechanisms to maintain social interaction data
    and may influence social behavior or reputation systems depending on the emote
    type and context. It does not directly send packets to clients but rather maintains
    state for social interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Record a wave emote
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->RecordEmote(EMOTE_TYPE_WAVE);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal social system and should only be called
    when a valid emote action occurs. It assumes that the player has already been
    validated for performing the emote. The actual emote display logic is handled
    separately by the client-side packet sending mechanism.
  warnings: Do not call this function without ensuring proper validation of the emote
    type or player state, as it may lead to inconsistent social data tracking. This
    method does not perform any network communication directly.
