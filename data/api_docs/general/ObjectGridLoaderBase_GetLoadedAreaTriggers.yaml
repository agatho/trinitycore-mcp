  signature: uint32 ObjectGridLoaderBase::GetLoadedAreaTriggers() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of loaded area triggers in the grid.
  description: The GetLoadedAreaTriggers method returns the number of area triggers
    that have been successfully loaded and are currently active within the object
    grid. This method is typically used during grid loading or unloading processes
    to track resource usage and ensure proper cleanup. Area triggers are used in World
    of Warcraft to define regions that can activate events, quests, or other game
    mechanics when players enter or exit them. The returned value represents a count
    of these loaded triggers, which helps with memory management and performance monitoring.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of area triggers currently
    loaded in the grid. Returns zero if no area triggers are loaded or if the grid
    has not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Loaded Triggers
    code: "uint32 triggerCount = loader.GetLoadedAreaTriggers();\nif (triggerCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Grid contains %u area triggers.\", triggerCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Grid Resource Usage
    code: "void MonitorGridTriggers(ObjectGridLoaderBase& loader)\n{\n    uint32 triggers\
      \ = loader.GetLoadedAreaTriggers();\n    if (triggers > 1000)\n    {\n     \
      \   sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Warning: Grid has %u loaded area triggers.\"\
      , triggers);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during grid loading/unloading operations
    and may be used internally by the core engine to manage memory and performance.
    The count returned includes all area triggers regardless of their type or activation
    state.
  warnings: The returned value only reflects currently loaded triggers and does not
    account for triggers that might be pending load or scheduled for unload. This
    method should not be relied upon for real-time trigger state management.
