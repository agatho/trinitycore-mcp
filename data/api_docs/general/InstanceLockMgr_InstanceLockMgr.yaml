  brief: Moves an InstanceLockMgr object, transferring its resources to another instance.
  description: The InstanceLockMgr move constructor transfers all resources from the
    right-hand InstanceLockMgr object to this instance. This operation is typically
    used when moving objects between scopes or when implementing move semantics for
    the InstanceLockMgr class. The moved-from object will be left in a valid but unspecified
    state, typically with no active locks or references. This method is part of the
    standard C++ move semantics implementation and should only be called during object
    construction from an rvalue reference.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing InstanceLockMgr
    code: 'InstanceLockMgr lock1;

      // ... populate lock1 with data ...

      InstanceLockMgr lock2 = std::move(lock1); // Move constructor called here

      // lock1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Container Move Operations
    code: 'std::vector<InstanceLockMgr> locks;

      locks.emplace_back();

      // ... populate first element ...

      locks.push_back(std::move(locks.front())); // Move the first element to end
      of vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed for efficient
    resource transfer rather than duplication. After calling this constructor, the
    source object should not be used in any way that assumes it still holds valid
    data. The implementation should ensure thread safety if the InstanceLockMgr manages
    shared resources.
  warnings: Do not use the moved-from object after this constructor is called. The
    behavior of using the source object afterward is undefined. This constructor should
    only be invoked with an rvalue reference (e.g., via std::move()).
