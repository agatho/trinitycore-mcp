  class: FeralBleedTracker
  method: ApplyRip
  signature: void FeralBleedTracker::ApplyRip(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a Rip effect to a target with the specified duration.
  description: The ApplyRip method is used to initiate or refresh a Rip effect on
    a target unit within the Feral Bleed Tracker system. This method typically corresponds
    to a feral ability that deals periodic damage over time, commonly found in feral
    druid gameplay. The method accepts a unique identifier for the target and a duration
    value, which determines how long the Rip effect will persist. It is generally
    invoked when a player successfully lands a Rip attack or when the effect needs
    to be refreshed. This method does not return any value but modifies internal state
    related to the target's ongoing bleed effects.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit that will receive
      the Rip effect. This is typically a player or creature GUID used in TrinityCore's
      entity management system.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Rip effect should remain
      active on the target. This value determines how long the periodic damage will
      be applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ApplyRip
    code: 'FeralBleedTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyRip(12345, 15000); // Applies Rip to target with GUID 12345 for
      15 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Rip in a Combat Scenario
    code: "void OnPlayerAttack(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target && target->IsCreature())\n\
      \    {\n        FeralBleedTracker tracker;\n        tracker.ApplyRip(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),\
      \ 10000); // Apply 10-second Rip\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal tracking system of active
    bleed effects. It may reset or extend an existing Rip timer if one is already
    applied to the target. The duration parameter should be validated to ensure it
    falls within expected ranges for game balance.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided corresponds to a valid and alive unit, as
    applying effects to invalid targets can cause undefined behavior. Be cautious
    when refreshing durations to avoid unintended stacking or overwriting of existing
    effects.
