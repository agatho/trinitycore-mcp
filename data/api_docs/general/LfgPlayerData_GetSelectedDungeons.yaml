documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the set of selected dungeons for the player's LFG (Looking for
    Group) data.
  description: The GetSelectedDungeons method returns a constant reference to the
    set of dungeons that have been selected by the player for a Looking for Group
    (LFG) activity. This set typically represents the player's intended dungeon choices
    during the LFG process, which may be used to match the player with suitable group
    members or to determine eligibility for specific LFG queues. The returned LfgDungeonSet
    is immutable and should not be modified directly. This method is part of the LfgPlayerData
    class that manages individual player's LFG-related state within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an LfgDungeonSet, which contains all the dungeon
    IDs selected by the player for LFG purposes. The set is immutable and represents
    a snapshot of the player's current dungeon selections.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate over selected dungeons
    code: "LfgPlayerData* playerData = ...;\nconst LfgDungeonSet& dungeons = playerData->GetSelectedDungeons();\n\
      for (LfgDungeonSet::const_iterator it = dungeons.begin(); it != dungeons.end();\
      \ ++it)\n{\n    uint32 dungeonId = *it;\n    // Process each selected dungeon\
      \ ID\n    std::cout << \"Selected dungeon ID: \" << dungeonId << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned LfgDungeonSet is a snapshot of the player's selections at the
    time of the method call. Modifications to the set returned by this method do not
    affect the underlying data in LfgPlayerData, as it returns a const reference.
    This method does not perform any validation or filtering on the dungeon IDs.
