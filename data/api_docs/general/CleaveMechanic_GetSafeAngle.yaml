  class: CleaveMechanic
  method: GetSafeAngle
  signature: float CleaveMechanic::GetSafeAngle(bool preferLeft) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the safest angle for a cleave attack based on preferred
    direction.
  description: The GetSafeAngle method computes the optimal angle for performing a
    cleave mechanic, taking into account the positioning of targets and avoiding harmful
    interactions. It evaluates the surrounding environment to determine whether a
    left or right cleave angle provides the safest path for execution. This method
    is typically used in AI behavior systems where precise targeting and movement
    are required to maximize damage while minimizing risk of self-inflicted harm or
    collision with obstacles.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated safe angle in radians.
    A positive value indicates a clockwise rotation from the current facing direction,
    while a negative value indicates a counter-clockwise rotation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float safeAngle = cleaveMechanic.GetSafeAngle(true);

      // Uses left preference for cleave angle calculation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Angle Selection
    code: 'bool preferLeft = targetCount > 3;

      float angle = cleaveMechanic.GetSafeAngle(preferLeft);

      // Adjusts cleave direction based on number of targets'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal state of CleaveMechanic has been properly
    initialized with target data and environment information. The result is cached
    internally and may be recalculated if target positions or environmental factors
    change.
  warnings: The returned angle value represents a relative rotation from the current
    facing direction, not an absolute world angle. Ensure proper coordinate system
    conversion when applying this value to character movement or orientation.
