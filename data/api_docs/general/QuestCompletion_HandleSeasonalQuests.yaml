documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles seasonal quests for a given player character
  description: The HandleSeasonalQuests method is responsible for managing seasonal
    quest completion logic within the TrinityCore framework. This function evaluates
    whether a player has met the criteria for seasonal quests, updates their quest
    status accordingly, and may trigger associated rewards or events. The method typically
    operates during quest update cycles or when specific seasonal conditions are detected.
    It ensures that seasonal content is properly integrated into the player's quest
    progression system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which seasonal quests should be
      processed. Must not be null and must represent a valid player character in the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      QuestCompletion questHandler;

      questHandler.HandleSeasonalQuests(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's seasonal event system and may
    depend on time-based conditions. It should be called during appropriate update
    cycles to ensure timely processing of seasonal quest states.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null reference could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method
    assumes proper initialization of seasonal quest data within the player's quest
    log.
