  class: AuctionHouse
  method: ExecuteCollectorStrategy
  signature: void AuctionHouse::ExecuteCollectorStrategy(int * player, AuctionSession
    & session)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the auction house collector strategy for processing pending auctions.
  description: The ExecuteCollectorStrategy method is responsible for running the
    auction house collector logic, which handles the processing of expired or sold
    auctions. This method typically iterates through the auction list and performs
    necessary cleanup operations such as sending notifications to bidders, updating
    item ownership, and removing completed auctions from the system. The strategy
    may involve different behaviors depending on the auction state and the configured
    auction house settings. It is usually invoked during periodic maintenance cycles
    or when specific auction events occur.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier associated
      with the auction session. This parameter may be used to determine which auctions
      belong to a specific player or to track session-related data.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to an AuctionSession object that holds the current auction
      session state, including active auctions, bid information, and session-specific
      configurations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionSession session;

      // Initialize session with auction data

      auctionHouse->ExecuteCollectorStrategy(&playerId, session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Session Management
    code: 'int playerId = 0;

      AuctionSession session;

      // Set up session with specific auction data

      session.SetAuctionHouseId(1);

      session.SetPlayerId(54321);

      auctionHouse->ExecuteCollectorStrategy(&playerId, session);

      // Auctions are processed and cleaned up accordingly'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the auction house's periodic maintenance
    routines. It may perform operations that affect database state and should be used
    carefully in performance-critical contexts. Ensure that the session object is
    properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Improper initialization of the AuctionSession parameter can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate the input parameters, especially when dealing
    with player identifiers and session data.
