  class: PathGenerator
  method: BuildPointPath
  signature: void PathGenerator::BuildPointPath(const float * startPoint, const float
    * endPoint)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a point-based path between two given coordinates for NPC movement
    or object positioning.
  description: The BuildPointPath method calculates and stores a path consisting of
    intermediate waypoints between a starting point and an ending point. This functionality
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore for generating movement paths
    for NPCs, creatures, or game objects. The generated path can be retrieved later
    using other methods within the PathGenerator class. The method does not perform
    any actual movement but rather prepares the data structure needed for path following
    logic. It typically assumes a straight-line path unless additional pathfinding
    logic is implemented in the underlying system.
  parameters:
  - name: startPoint
    description: A pointer to an array of three floats representing the X, Y, and
      Z coordinates of the starting position in world space.
  - name: endPoint
    description: A pointer to an array of three floats representing the X, Y, and
      Z coordinates of the destination position in world space.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Generation for NPC Movement
    code: 'float start[3] = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      float end[3] = {150.0f, 250.0f, 350.0f};

      PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.BuildPointPath(start, end);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using PathGenerator with Dynamic Coordinates
    code: 'float playerPos[3];

      player->GetLocation(playerPos);

      float targetPos[3] = {500.0f, 600.0f, 700.0f};

      PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.BuildPointPath(playerPos, targetPos);

      // Later retrieve and follow the path

      std::vector<Position> waypoints = pathGen.GetPath();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger pathfinding system that may integrate with
    collision detection or terrain height calculations. The resulting path points
    are typically stored internally and can be accessed via GetPath() or similar methods.
    Performance depends on the complexity of the underlying pathfinding algorithm,
    which may include obstacle avoidance or terrain considerations.
  warnings: Ensure that both startPoint and endPoint parameters point to valid memory
    locations containing at least three float values each. Passing invalid pointers
    or null references will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. This method
    does not validate whether the path is traversable; it only generates a sequence
    of points between start and end.
