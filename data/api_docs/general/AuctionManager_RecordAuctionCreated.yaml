documentation:
  brief: Records the creation of an auction in the auction house system for a specified
    bot.
  description: The RecordAuctionCreated method logs the creation of a new auction
    entry within the TrinityCore auction house system. This method is typically invoked
    when a bot player creates an auction, ensuring that the auction is properly tracked
    and recorded in the database. It likely updates internal tracking structures and
    may trigger additional game mechanics such as notifications or logging for administrative
    purposes. The method operates on a per-bot basis, identified by the provided botGuid
    parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot player who created the auction.
      This value is used to associate the auction with the specific bot account in
      the system.

  notes: This method is likely part of the bot auction system and may be used in conjunction
    with other bot-related auction management functions. It should only be called
    after verifying that the auction has been successfully created in the system.
