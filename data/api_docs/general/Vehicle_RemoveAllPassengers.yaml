documentation:
  brief: Removes all passengers from the vehicle.
  description: The RemoveAllPassengers method safely ejects all currently seated passengers
    from the vehicle. This operation is typically invoked when a vehicle is destroyed,
    despawned, or needs to be cleared of all occupants. The method iterates through
    all passenger seats and removes each passenger, ensuring proper cleanup of seat
    assignments and notifying the affected players of their dismount. This function
    is essential for maintaining game state consistency and preventing dangling references
    to passengers in the vehicle's passenger list.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage - Clearing Vehicle Passengers
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    vehicle->RemoveAllPassengers();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Vehicle Destruction Logic
    code: "void Vehicle::OnDeath()\n{\n    // Remove all passengers before destruction\n\
      \    RemoveAllPassengers();\n    \n    // Proceed with vehicle destruction logic\n\
      \    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs cleanup operations on each passenger, including updating
    their mount state and seat assignments. It is designed to be safe for use during
    vehicle destruction or cleanup scenarios. The implementation ensures that passengers
    are properly removed from the vehicle's internal passenger list and their player
    state is updated accordingly.
  warnings: Calling this method while iterating over passengers externally may cause
    undefined behavior due to modification of the passenger list during iteration.
    Always ensure proper synchronization if used in multithreaded contexts.
