  class: Item
  method: GetRequiredLevel
  signature: int32 Item::GetRequiredLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the required level for an item, determining the minimum level needed
    to equip it.
  description: The GetRequiredLevel method retrieves the minimum character level required
    to use a specific item. This value is crucial for game balance and player progression,
    as it determines whether a player can equip the item based on their current level.
    The method returns an integer representing the level requirement, which can be
    zero for items that do not require a level to equip. For items with level requirements,
    this value typically corresponds to the item's level or a specific requirement
    set in the item's data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the required level for the item.
    A value of 0 indicates no level requirement, while positive values indicate the
    minimum level needed to equip the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 requiredLevel = item->GetRequiredLevel();\nif (requiredLevel > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Item requires a minimum level to equip\n    printf(\"Item requires\
      \ level %d\\n\", requiredLevel);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Item can be equipped at\
      \ any level\n    printf(\"Item can be equipped at any level\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Item class and is commonly used in item evaluation
    logic. It's typically called during item validation checks to ensure players meet
    requirements before equipping items. Performance-wise, it's a fast operation as
    it simply reads from internal data structures.
  warnings: Be aware that some items may have different level requirements for different
    purposes (e.g., equip vs. use), and this method returns the general required level
    for item usage. Also note that this value might be zero for items that don't require
    a level to equip, which could lead to confusion if not properly handled in code.
