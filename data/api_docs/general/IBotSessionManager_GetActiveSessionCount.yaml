  signature: uint32 IBotSessionManager::GetActiveSessionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of active bot sessions managed by the session manager.
  description: The GetActiveSessionCount method retrieves the number of currently
    active bot sessions within the system. This count represents all sessions that
    are in an operational state, meaning they have been initialized and are actively
    processing commands or maintaining their connection to the game world. The method
    is typically used for monitoring purposes, such as tracking resource usage, load
    balancing across multiple bot instances, or ensuring that the system does not
    exceed configured limits for active sessions. It provides a snapshot of the current
    operational state of the bot infrastructure at the time of the call.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active bot sessions currently
    managed by this session manager instance. Returns zero if no active sessions exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Active Sessions
    code: "uint32 activeCount = sessionManager->GetActiveSessionCount();\nif (activeCount\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    // Log warning or take action\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_BOTS,\
      \ \"Warning: %u active bot sessions detected.\", activeCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Active Session Count for Load Balancing
    code: "uint32 currentActive = sessionManager->GetActiveSessionCount();\nif (currentActive\
      \ < MAX_BOT_SESSIONS)\n{\n    // Start a new bot session\n    sessionManager->CreateNewSession();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle overload or queue new requests\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_BOTS,\
      \ \"Maximum sessions reached. Current: %u\", currentActive);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter and is
    generally fast. It's thread-safe if the underlying session manager implementation
    uses appropriate synchronization mechanisms for updating the active session count.
  warnings: The returned value may change between calls as bot sessions are created
    or destroyed. If used in a loop or conditional logic, ensure that the state is
    not assumed to remain constant across multiple invocations.
