  method: CanPerformRole
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::CanPerformRole(BotRole role) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the adaptive behavior manager can perform the specified
    bot role.
  description: The CanPerformRole method evaluates if the current adaptive behavior
    manager instance is capable of executing a given bot role. This method typically
    checks internal state, configuration settings, or contextual conditions to determine
    role eligibility. It's commonly used in AI-driven bot systems within TrinityCore
    to ensure that bots are assigned roles they can properly fulfill based on their
    capabilities and current operational context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the adaptive behavior manager can perform the specified
    role; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Check
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager behaviorManager;\nif (behaviorManager.CanPerformRole(BotRole::Tank))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with tank role assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Role Assignment
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager manager;\nBotRole role = BotRole::Healer;\nif (manager.CanPerformRole(role))\
      \ {\n    // Assign healer role to bot\n    bot->SetRole(role);\n} else {\n \
      \   // Handle case where role cannot be performed\n    Log(\"Cannot assign healer\
      \ role to bot.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other adaptive behavior logic
    to dynamically assign roles to bots based on their capabilities and the current
    needs of the group or encounter.
