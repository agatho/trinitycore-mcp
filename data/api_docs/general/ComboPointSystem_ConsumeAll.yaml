documentation:
  brief: Consumes all combo points from the ComboPointSystem
  description: The ConsumeAll method clears all currently accumulated combo points
    from the ComboPointSystem. This operation typically occurs when a player's combo
    point generation is interrupted or when specific game mechanics require the immediate
    consumption of all available combo points. The method does not return any value
    and directly modifies the internal state of the system by setting all combo point
    counters to zero. This functionality is commonly used in combat scenarios where
    combo points must be reset due to ability usage, movement, or other interrupting
    events.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ComboPointSystem* system = player->GetComboPointSystem();

      system->ConsumeAll();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal combo point state and should only
    be called when the game logic requires immediate clearing of all combo points.
    It does not trigger any events or callbacks related to combo point consumption.
