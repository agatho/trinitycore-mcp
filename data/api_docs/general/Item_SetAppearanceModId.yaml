  class: Item
  method: SetAppearanceModId
  signature: void Item::SetAppearanceModId(uint32 appearanceModId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the appearance modifier ID for an item, allowing customization of its
    visual appearance in-game.
  description: This method assigns a specific appearance modifier ID to an Item object,
    which controls how the item appears visually to players. The appearance modifier
    ID determines the visual changes applied to the item's model, such as color, texture,
    or other cosmetic modifications. This functionality is commonly used for customizing
    items in World of Warcraft, particularly in scenarios where item customization
    needs to be adjusted programmatically. The method does not validate whether the
    provided ID is valid; it simply sets the internal value without checking against
    game data or restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: appearanceModId
    description: The appearance modifier ID to assign to the item. This ID corresponds
      to a specific visual modification that can be applied to the item's model, such
      as a custom color or texture change.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetAppearanceModId(12345);

      // The item now has its appearance modified with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      uint32 modId = 98765;

      item->SetAppearanceModId(modId);

      // This sets the appearance modifier ID for a custom item

      // that may be used in a custom content or scenario'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the internal data of the Item object. It does
    not perform any validation or checks on the provided appearanceModId, meaning
    it's possible to set invalid IDs without error. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with other item customization methods and may be part of a larger
    system for managing item visual properties.
  warnings: This method should only be used when working with valid appearance modifier
    IDs, as setting invalid IDs can lead to unexpected behavior or visual glitches
    in-game. Also, this method does not handle any synchronization or updates to the
    client-side display; it only sets the internal value.
