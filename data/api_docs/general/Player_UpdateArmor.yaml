documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's armor value based on equipped items and buffs
  description: The UpdateArmor method recalculates and applies the player's total
    armor value by considering all equipped items, racial traits, and active buffs
    or debuffs. This method is typically invoked when equipment changes occur or when
    buff states are modified. The updated armor value affects the player's damage
    mitigation from physical attacks in the game mechanics. This method does not directly
    modify the player's armor stat display but ensures internal calculations remain
    accurate for combat calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateArmor();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Equipment Change
    code: "Item* newItem = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, slot);\nif (newItem)\n\
      {\n    player->SetInventorySlot(slot, newItem);\n    player->UpdateArmor();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the core when equipment changes occur
    through the inventory system. Developers should not typically call this method
    directly unless implementing custom armor calculation logic or debugging.
  warnings: Calling UpdateArmor() manually may cause unexpected behavior if not properly
    synchronized with the game state. It's recommended to use the inventory system
    methods which handle armor updates automatically.
