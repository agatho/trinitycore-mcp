  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateZoneRequirements(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets all zone requirements for a specified quest
  description: The ValidateZoneRequirements method checks if a given player has met
    all the zone-related prerequisites necessary to accept or interact with a specific
    quest. This includes verifying that the player is in the correct zone, has the
    required zone flags, and satisfies any zone-based quest restrictions defined in
    the game's quest system. The method typically integrates with TrinityCore's quest
    validation framework to ensure quest progression aligns with player location and
    zone-specific conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being validated. Must correspond
      to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose zone requirements
      are being checked. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if all zone requirements for the specified quest are satisfied
    by the player, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the
    player is in an incorrect zone, lacks required zone flags, or fails other zone-based
    validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Zone Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateZoneRequirements(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player meets all zone requirements for quest 12345\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n\
      } else {\n    // Player does not meet zone requirements\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You are not in the correct zone for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateZoneRequirements(quest->GetQuestId(),\
      \ player)) {\n        player->SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REASON_NOT_IN_ZONE);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest acceptance logic\n\
      \    player->AddQuest(quest, NULL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal zone tracking and quest database entries.
    It may perform database lookups or cached zone data checks depending on the implementation.
    The method assumes that the player's current zone is properly updated in the game
    state before validation.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or
    crashes. Additionally, this method may not account for dynamic zone changes during
    runtime if the player's zone data isn't refreshed properly.
