  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: ScanTerrain
  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::ScanTerrain(const DetectionContext & context,
    int & obstacles)
documentation:
  brief: Scans the terrain for obstacles in the specified detection context and updates
    the obstacle count.
  description: The ScanTerrain method performs a terrain analysis within the provided
    DetectionContext to identify and count potential obstacles that could impede movement.
    This method is typically used in AI pathfinding systems to avoid collisions with
    environmental features such as walls, cliffs, or other impassable terrain. The
    method updates the obstacles parameter with the number of detected obstacles found
    during the scan. It operates on the current position and orientation of the entity
    associated with the detection context, checking for navigational hazards in the
    surrounding area.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: The DetectionContext object containing the current position, orientation,
      and detection parameters for terrain scanning.
  - name: obstacles
    description: Reference to an integer that will be updated with the count of detected
      obstacles found during the terrain scan.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle detection usage
    code: "DetectionContext context;\ncontext.position = player->GetPosition();\n\
      context.orientation = player->GetOrientation();\nint obstacleCount = 0;\nobstacleManager.ScanTerrain(context,\
      \ obstacleCount);\nif (obstacleCount > 0)\n{\n    // Handle obstacle avoidance\
      \ logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Detected %d obstacles\", obstacleCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI obstacle avoidance system and should be called
    regularly during pathfinding operations. The detection context must contain valid
    position data for accurate results. Performance may vary depending on terrain
    complexity and detection radius settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the DetectionContext is properly initialized with valid position
    and orientation data before calling this method. Failure to do so may result in
    incorrect obstacle counts or undefined behavior.
