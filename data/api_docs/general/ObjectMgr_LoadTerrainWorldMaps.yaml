documentation:
  brief: Loads terrain world map data into memory for use in the game world.
  description: The LoadTerrainWorldMaps method initializes and loads terrain-related
    world map information from the database into the ObjectMgr's internal data structures.
    This method is typically called during server startup or world initialization
    to ensure that all terrain data required for world map rendering, navigation,
    and zone-specific behaviors are available. It processes database entries related
    to world maps, terrain heights, and geographic boundaries to support client-side
    map rendering and server-side zone management. The method does not return any
    value but updates internal state necessary for world map functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadTerrainWorldMaps()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadTerrainWorldMaps();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup sequence before the
    world is fully initialized. It may involve database queries and memory allocation
    for terrain data structures, so performance impact should be considered during
    server boot-up. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and that relevant tables contain valid terrain map data.
