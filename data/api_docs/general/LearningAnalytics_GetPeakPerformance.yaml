  method: GetPeakPerformance
  signature: float LearningAnalytics::GetPeakPerformance(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the peak performance value for a specified bot GUID.
  description: The GetPeakPerformance method retrieves the highest recorded performance
    metric for a specific bot identified by its unique GUID. This method is typically
    used in analytics systems to track and evaluate the maximum efficiency or capability
    achieved by a particular bot during its operational lifetime. The returned float
    value represents the peak performance score, which may be normalized or weighted
    based on internal game mechanics. The method assumes that performance data has
    been previously collected and stored for the specified bot. If no performance
    data exists for the given GUID, the behavior is undefined and may result in unexpected
    values or errors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the peak performance score for the specified
    bot. The exact scale and interpretation of this value depend on the internal implementation
    of the analytics system, but it generally indicates the maximum efficiency or
    capability achieved by the bot during its operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LearningAnalytics* analytics = sWorld->GetLearningAnalytics();

      float peakPerformance = analytics->GetPeakPerformance(12345);

      printf("Peak performance for bot 12345: %.2f\n", peakPerformance);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger learning analytics framework that
    tracks bot behavior and performance over time. The implementation may cache results
    or access stored performance metrics from a database. Ensure that the provided
    botGuid corresponds to an existing bot in the system to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may lead
    to undefined behavior, including potential crashes or incorrect return values.
    Always validate the existence of the bot before calling this method if such validation
    is not handled internally.
