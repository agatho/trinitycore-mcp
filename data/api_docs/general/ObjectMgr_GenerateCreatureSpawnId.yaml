  class: ObjectMgr
  method: GenerateCreatureSpawnId
  signature: int ObjectMgr::GenerateCreatureSpawnId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a unique spawn identifier for creature objects within
    the World of Warcraft server.
  description: The GenerateCreatureSpawnId method is responsible for producing a unique
    integer identifier that represents a specific spawn instance of a creature in
    the game world. This ID is used internally by TrinityCore to track and manage
    individual creature spawns, ensuring that each spawned creature has a distinct
    identifier for networking, persistence, and reference purposes. The method typically
    operates within a thread-safe context and maintains an internal counter or generator
    to ensure uniqueness across all creature spawn operations. It's commonly invoked
    when creating new creature entries in the database or during world loading processes
    where spawn data needs to be assigned.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique spawn ID for a creature. This
    ID is guaranteed to be unique within the current server instance and should be
    used when inserting or updating creature spawn records in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature Spawn Creation
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      int spawnId = sObjectMgr->GenerateCreatureSpawnId();

      creature->SetSpawnId(spawnId);

      // Use spawnId for database insertion or further processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically thread-safe and should not be called concurrently
    from multiple threads without proper synchronization. The generated IDs are sequential
    and may be reused after server restarts, but within a single session they remain
    unique. It's recommended to use this method only when creating new creature spawn
    entries.
  warnings: Do not call this method for existing creatures that already have assigned
    spawn IDs; doing so will result in incorrect tracking of creature instances in
    the database. This method should only be used during creation or initialization
    phases of creature spawning.
