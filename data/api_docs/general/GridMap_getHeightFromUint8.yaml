  signature: float GridMap::getHeightFromUint8(float x, float y) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the height value at the specified coordinates from the grid map's
    height data.
  description: The getHeightFromUint8 method is used to obtain the height value at
    a given (x, y) coordinate within a grid map. This method accesses precomputed
    height data stored in a uint8 format and returns the corresponding floating-point
    height value. It is typically used for terrain collision detection, pathfinding,
    and determining object placement on the game world. The method assumes that the
    input coordinates are valid and within the bounds of the grid map. This function
    is part of TrinityCore's grid-based world management system where each grid tile
    contains height information for efficient spatial queries.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate in world space for which to retrieve the height
      value.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate in world space for which to retrieve the height
      value.
  returns: A float value representing the height at the specified (x, y) coordinates.
    Returns a valid height value if the coordinates are within bounds; behavior is
    undefined for out-of-bounds coordinates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Height Retrieval
    code: 'float height = gridMap.getHeightFromUint8(100.5f, 200.3f);

      // Returns the height at position (100.5, 200.3) in the grid map'
    language: cpp
  - title: Height-Based Collision Check
    code: "float playerHeight = gridMap.getHeightFromUint8(playerX, playerY);\nfloat\
      \ groundHeight = gridMap.getHeightFromUint8(groundX, groundY);\nif (playerHeight\
      \ > groundHeight + 1.0f) {\n    // Player is above ground level by more than\
      \ 1 unit\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on precomputed height data that is typically loaded
    from map files during server initialization. The height values are stored in a
    compressed uint8 format for memory efficiency. The method does not perform bounds
    checking, so calling it with invalid coordinates may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. For performance-critical applications, consider caching
    frequently accessed height values.
  warnings: Calling this method with out-of-bounds coordinates can lead to memory
    access violations or return garbage data. Always validate input coordinates before
    calling this method. The returned height value is relative to the map's base elevation
    and should be interpreted within the context of the game world's coordinate system.
