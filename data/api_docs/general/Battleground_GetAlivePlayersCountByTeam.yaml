  method: GetAlivePlayersCountByTeam
  signature: int Battleground::GetAlivePlayersCountByTeam(int team) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of alive players on the specified team in the battleground.
  description: The GetAlivePlayersCountByTeam method retrieves the number of players
    who are currently alive and part of the specified team within the battleground.
    This method is commonly used during battleground scoring, win condition checks,
    and UI updates to display player counts. The method takes a team identifier as
    input and returns an integer representing the count of alive players on that team.
    It's important to note that this method only counts players who are actively participating
    in the battleground and have not been defeated or left the game. This functionality
    is essential for determining battleground outcomes, such as when one team has
    no remaining alive players, indicating a win for the opposing team.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier to count alive players for. Typically 0 for alliance
      and 1 for horde in standard battlegrounds.
  returns: An integer representing the number of alive players on the specified team.
    Returns 0 if the team has no alive players or if an invalid team ID is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Team Survival
    code: "if (bg->GetAlivePlayersCountByTeam(TEAM_ALLIANCE) == 0)\n{\n    // Alliance\
      \ has no alive players, horde wins\n    bg->EndBattleground(TEAM_HORDE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Displaying Player Counts in UI
    code: 'int allianceCount = bg->GetAlivePlayersCountByTeam(TEAM_ALLIANCE);

      int hordeCount = bg->GetAlivePlayersCountByTeam(TEAM_HORDE);

      // Update UI elements with these counts

      sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_ARENA_PLAYER_COUNTS, allianceCount, hordeCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method iterates through all players in the battleground to count alive
    ones, which may have performance implications during high-frequency updates. The
    method assumes valid team IDs (typically 0 for alliance and 1 for horde) and does
    not validate input parameters beyond basic existence checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the team parameter is valid before calling this method, as
    invalid team IDs might lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect counts. This method
    should not be used during battleground initialization or cleanup phases when player
    data may be inconsistent.
