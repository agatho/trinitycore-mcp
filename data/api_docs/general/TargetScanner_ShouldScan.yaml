  class: TargetScanner
  method: ShouldScan
  signature: bool TargetScanner::ShouldScan(uint32 currentTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the target scanner should perform a scan at the given
    time.
  description: The ShouldScan method evaluates if a target scanner instance should
    execute a new scan operation based on its internal timing logic and current state.
    This method is typically used in AI or targeting systems to control how frequently
    targets are checked for validity, relevance, or eligibility. It ensures that scanning
    does not occur too frequently, which could cause performance issues, or too infrequently,
    which might miss important target changes. The decision is based on the scanner's
    internal cooldown mechanism and the provided current time value.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the scanner should perform a scan at the specified time;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (scanner.ShouldScan(getCurrentTime())) {\n    scanner.ScanTargets();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdateAI() {\n    uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\n    if (targetScanner.ShouldScan(currentTime))\
      \ {\n        targetScanner.ScanForNewTargets();\n        targetScanner.UpdateLastScanTime(currentTime);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other timing-related functions
    within TrinityCore's AI framework. It relies on internal state tracking to determine
    scan eligibility, so calling it without proper initialization may lead to unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the input time value is valid and represents a meaningful
    point in time (e.g., from GetMSTime() or similar). Using an invalid timestamp
    could cause incorrect scan decisions.
