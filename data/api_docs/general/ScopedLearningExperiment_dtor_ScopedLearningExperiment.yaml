documentation:
  brief: Destroys the scoped learning experiment instance and cleans up associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the ScopedLearningExperiment class is responsible
    for releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance.
    This method ensures proper cleanup when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and game mechanics, this may involve
    cleaning up temporary data structures used during machine learning experiments
    or simulation scenarios. The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime
    when the object's lifetime ends.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of scoped experiment
    code: 'ScopedLearningExperiment experiment;

      // ... perform operations ...

      // Destructor called automatically when experiment goes out of scope'
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion in heap allocation
    code: 'ScopedLearningExperiment* experiment = new ScopedLearningExperiment();

      // ... perform operations ...

      delete experiment; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not throw exceptions as it's called during stack unwinding.
    If any cleanup operations might fail, they should be handled before the destructor
    is invoked. This class likely manages temporary game state or AI training data
    that must be properly disposed of to prevent memory leaks.
  warnings: Avoid calling the destructor directly unless you're explicitly managing
    heap-allocated objects. The destructor will be automatically called when an object
    goes out of scope, and manual invocation can lead to double-free errors if not
    handled carefully.
