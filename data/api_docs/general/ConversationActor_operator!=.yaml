documentation:
  brief: Compares two ConversationActor objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this ConversationActor
    instance and another ConversationActor object to determine if they are not equal.
    This comparison is typically based on the underlying data members of the ConversationActor,
    such as GUIDs or internal identifiers that uniquely define each actor in a conversation
    context. The method returns true if the two objects differ in any significant
    way, and false if they are considered equivalent. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, this operator is commonly used when managing dialogue trees, NPC interactions,
    or quest-related conversations where distinct actors need to be differentiated
    from one another.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current ConversationActor object is not equal to the
    right-hand side ConversationActor object; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check between two ConversationActors
    code: 'ConversationActor actor1;

      ConversationActor actor2;

      bool areDifferent = (actor1 != actor2); // Returns true if actors are not the
      same

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is likely implemented using a member-wise comparison of key
    fields such as GUID, type, or other unique identifiers. It's important to note
    that equality comparisons in game systems often involve more than just simple
    field checks due to potential transient states or dynamic data.
