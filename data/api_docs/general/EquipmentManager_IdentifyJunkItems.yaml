documentation:
  brief: Identifies and categorizes junk items in the player's equipment
  description: The IdentifyJunkItems method scans a player's inventory and equipment
    to determine which items are considered 'junk' based on game rules and item quality.
    It evaluates each item against predefined criteria such as item level, quality
    threshold, and player class restrictions to classify them as junk. This method
    is typically used during inventory management operations or when the player attempts
    to sell or discard unwanted items. The function returns a count of identified
    junk items or an error code if the operation fails.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose equipment will be analyzed for
      junk items. Must point to a valid Player instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns the number of junk items identified in the player's inventory and
    equipment. Returns -1 if an error occurs during processing or if the input player
    pointer is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to identify junk items
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nint junkCount = equipmentManager->IdentifyJunkItems(&player);\n\
      if (junkCount >= 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Found %d junk items\\n\", junkCount);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Error identifying junk items\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a full inventory scan and may have performance
    implications for players with large inventories. It should be called sparingly
    in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: The player parameter must not be null or point to an invalid object, as
    this will result in undefined behavior. The returned count does not include items
    that are soulbound or otherwise restricted from being sold.
