  class: UnholyFesteringWoundTracker
  method: BurstWounds
  signature: void UnholyFesteringWoundTracker::BurstWounds(int guid, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers the burst effect of Festering Wounds for a specified unit, applying
    damage and debuffs based on tracked wound count.
  description: The BurstWounds method is responsible for executing the visual and
    mechanical effects associated with the Unholy Festering Wound ability in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore emulation. When called, it processes the accumulated
    festering wounds on a target unit identified by its GUID, applying damage over
    time effects and debuffs as defined by the game mechanics. This method typically
    occurs when the Unholy Death Knight's Festering Wound ability reaches its burst
    threshold or is explicitly triggered by certain spell effects. The method operates
    within the context of the Death Knight's Unholy specialization and interacts with
    the unit's combat state, damage application, and debuff tracking systems.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit affected by the festering
      wounds. This must be a valid creature or player GUID within the game world.
  - name: count
    description: The number of festering wounds to burst, determining the intensity
      and damage of the effect. Must be a positive integer representing wound stacks.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'UnholyFesteringWoundTracker tracker;

      tracker.BurstWounds(12345, 5); // Burst 5 festering wounds on unit with GUID
      12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Death Knight Spell System
    code: "void UnholyDeathKnight::ExecuteFesteringWoundBurst()\n{\n    if (Unit*\
      \ target = GetVictim())\n    {\n        int woundCount = m_festeringWoundsTracker.GetWoundCount(target->GetGUID());\n\
      \        m_festeringWoundsTracker.BurstWounds(target->GetGUID(), woundCount);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target unit is valid and within combat range.
    The actual damage calculation and debuff application are handled internally by
    TrinityCore's spell system. The method should only be called when the festering
    wounds have reached their burst threshold or when explicitly triggered by game
    mechanics.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the target unit exists and is in a valid state before
    invoking this method. Do not call this method outside of combat context unless
    specifically required by custom game mechanics.
