  class: Quest
  method: GetRequiredMinRepValue
  signature: int32 Quest::GetRequiredMinRepValue() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum required reputation value needed to complete the quest.
  description: This method retrieves the minimum reputation level required to be able
    to complete a specific quest. The returned value represents the threshold at which
    players must meet or exceed the reputation requirements to qualify for quest completion.
    This is typically used in conjunction with the GetRequiredMaxRepValue method to
    determine the full range of reputation needed for quest completion. The method
    is commonly used in quest scripts and quest-related logic to enforce reputation-based
    requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the minimum reputation level required
    for quest completion. A value of 0 indicates no reputation requirement, while
    higher values indicate the minimum reputation threshold needed. Negative values
    may be possible in some edge cases but are generally not expected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 minRep = quest->GetRequiredMinRepValue();\nif (minRep > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Check if player's reputation meets or exceeds the minimum\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be called on a valid quest
    object. The value returned corresponds to the reputation level required for the
    quest, not necessarily the specific faction. Performance considerations are minimal
    as this is a simple getter method.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    reputation-related methods, as incorrect handling may lead to quests being unattainable
    or incorrectly processed. Ensure that the quest object is valid before calling
    this method.
