  method: GetDuration
  signature: int32 SpellInfo::GetDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the duration in milliseconds of the spell.
  description: The GetDuration method retrieves the duration value of a spell as defined
    in the SpellInfo structure. This duration represents how long the spell effect
    will last, typically measured in milliseconds. The method is commonly used in
    spell handling logic to determine active spell effects and their time-based properties.
    It can be used for both instantaneous and persistent spells, with the value being
    zero for instant spells or negative for spells that are not yet active.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the duration of the spell in milliseconds.
    A value of zero indicates an instant spell, while positive values indicate ongoing
    duration, and negative values may indicate inactive or non-existent durations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nint32 duration\
      \ = spellInfo->GetDuration();\nif (duration > 0)\n{\n    // Spell has a duration\n\
      \    // Do something with the duration value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellInfo class and is typically used in conjunction
    with other spell-related methods to determine spell properties. It should be used
    carefully as it may return zero or negative values depending on the spell's configuration.
