  method: ClearOverrideScaleCurve
  signature: void AreaTrigger::ClearOverrideScaleCurve()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the override scale curve from the area trigger, restoring its default
    scaling behavior.
  description: The ClearOverrideScaleCurve method resets the area trigger's scale
    curve override to its default state. This method is typically used when a temporary
    visual or mechanical effect that modifies the area trigger's scale needs to be
    removed. It ensures that the area trigger returns to using its original scale
    curve definition, which may be defined in the database or through other means.
    The operation is immediate and affects only the specific area trigger instance
    on which it is called.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing Override Scale Curve
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    trigger->ClearOverrideScaleCurve();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on area triggers that have previously had
    their scale curve overridden. Calling it on a trigger without an override may
    have no effect or could lead to unexpected behavior if the system expects a specific
    state.
