documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the skill rank of a player at the specified position in their skill
    list.
  description: This method returns the skill rank value for a specific skill position
    within the player's skill list. It is commonly used to access skill information
    for various game mechanics such as crafting, professions, or abilities. The method
    operates on the player's internal skill data structure and provides direct access
    to skill values without requiring additional calculations or database queries.
    This function is particularly useful when working with skill systems that require
    precise rank information for determining unlock conditions or progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the skill rank value as a uint16, representing the current level
    of the skill at the specified position. The value typically ranges from 0 to 3000,
    with 0 indicating no skill and higher values representing advanced skill levels.
    A return value of 0 may indicate that the skill is not present in the player's
    skill list or has not been learned yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'uint16 skillRank = player->GetSkillRankByPos(0);

      // Returns the rank of the first skill in the player''s skill list'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "uint16 skillRank = player->GetSkillRankByPos(5);\nif (skillRank > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Skill is learned, proceed with further logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Skill\
      \ not yet learned or not present\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses player's internal skill data directly without any additional
    database calls. It should be used carefully in performance-critical code sections
    where multiple calls may impact overall frame rate. The method is thread-safe
    when used within the context of a single player object, but should not be called
    from multiple threads simultaneously.
  warnings: This method assumes that the position parameter refers to valid skill
    positions within the player's skill list. Invalid positions may result in undefined
    behavior or return values. Care must be taken when using this method with dynamic
    skill lists where skills may change during gameplay.
