documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of a source TerrainInfo object to this TerrainInfo object,
    leaving the source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The move assignment operator for the TerrainInfo class transfers ownership
    of resources from the source object to the current object. This operation is typically
    used to efficiently transfer expensive-to-copy objects without performing deep
    copies. The source object will be left in a valid state, though the specific contents
    are not guaranteed. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method
    likely handles terrain data structures and may be used during resource management
    or object initialization. This operator is part of the C++ move semantics standard
    and provides performance benefits by avoiding unnecessary copying of large data
    structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current TerrainInfo object after the move operation
    has completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'TerrainInfo terrain1;

      TerrainInfo terrain2 = std::move(terrain1); // Move-assigns terrain1 to terrain2

      // terrain1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'TerrainInfo t1, t2, t3;

      t3 = std::move(t2) = std::move(t1); // Chained move assignments

      // t1 and t2 are left in valid but unspecified states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using std::swap or similar techniques
    to efficiently transfer internal data members. It's important to note that after
    a move operation, the source object remains in a valid state but its contents
    are unspecified. This behavior is standard for C++ move semantics and allows for
    efficient resource management.
  warnings: Avoid using the source object after a move assignment unless you explicitly
    reinitialize it. The contents of the moved-from object are left in an unspecified
    but valid state, which can lead to undefined behavior if accessed directly.
