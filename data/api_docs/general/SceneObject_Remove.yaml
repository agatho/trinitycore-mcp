documentation:
  brief: Removes the scene object from its current context, typically unregistering
    it from the world or scene manager.
  description: The SceneObject::Remove method is responsible for removing a scene
    object from the active scene or world environment. This operation typically involves
    unregistering the object from any relevant managers or systems, ensuring that
    it no longer participates in scene updates, rendering, or other scene-related
    activities. The method may also handle cleanup of internal references and state
    management to prevent dangling pointers or memory leaks. This is commonly used
    when an object needs to be destroyed or temporarily hidden from the scene without
    immediately freeing its memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Scene Object Removal
    code: 'SceneObject* obj = ...; // Get a scene object

      obj->Remove(); // Remove it from the scene'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying a SceneObject instance to
    ensure proper cleanup of internal references and prevent potential memory leaks
    or dangling pointers. The exact behavior may depend on how the object was originally
    added to the scene.
  warnings: Calling Remove() on an already removed object may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the object is still valid before calling this
    method.
