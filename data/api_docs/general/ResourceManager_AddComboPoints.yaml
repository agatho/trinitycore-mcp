  class: ResourceManager
  method: AddComboPoints
  signature: void ResourceManager::AddComboPoints(uint32 points)
documentation:
  brief: Adds combo points to the resource manager for the associated player.
  description: The AddComboPoints method increases the combo point count for a player
    character within the ResourceManager. This functionality is typically used in
    combat scenarios where players earn combo points through successful attacks or
    abilities. The method directly modifies the internal combo point counter without
    any return value. It's commonly invoked during gameplay to reflect changes in
    player combo point accumulation, such as after landing critical hits or using
    specific abilities that generate combo points.
  parameters:
  - name: points
    description: The number of combo points to add to the current resource manager's
      combo point count. Must be a non-negative integer value representing valid combo
      points.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: resourceManager->AddComboPoints(1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Combo Points
    code: 'resourceManager->AddComboPoints(5);

      // Adds 5 combo points to the current total'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat events and should be used in
    conjunction with proper resource management. The ResourceManager class likely
    maintains a combo point counter that increments with each call to AddComboPoints.
