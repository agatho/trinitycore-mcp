  brief: Calculates the optimal number of echo targets for an evoker based on caster
    and ally parameters
  description: The CalculateOptimalEchoTargets method determines the ideal number
    of targets to apply Echo effects to for an evoker class character. This calculation
    considers both the caster's current state and the available allies within the
    combat environment. The method evaluates factors such as spell effectiveness,
    target distribution, and group composition to maximize the utility of the Echo
    ability. It is typically used during spell casting logic to determine how many
    friendly units should receive the Echo effect for optimal damage amplification
    or healing support.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's current state or
      identifier. This parameter likely contains information about the evoker's spell
      readiness, mana level, or other relevant casting attributes that influence target
      selection.
  - name: allies
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the total number of allies currently
      available in the combat environment. This value affects how many targets can
      be effectively chosen for the Echo effect based on group size and positioning.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated optimal number of echo targets.
    A positive value indicates the recommended count of allies to target with Echo
    effects, while zero or negative values may indicate insufficient conditions or
    no valid targets available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int casterState = 100; // Example caster state

      int allyCount = 5;

      int optimalTargets = calculator.CalculateOptimalEchoTargets(&casterState, allyCount);

      // Result: optimalTargets will be set to the calculated number of echo targets'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "int casterState = 85;\nint allyCount = 3;\nint result = calculator.CalculateOptimalEchoTargets(&casterState,\
      \ allyCount);\nif (result > 0) {\n    // Apply Echo to 'result' number of allies\n\
      \    ApplyEchoToTargets(result);\n} else {\n    // No valid targets or insufficient\
      \ conditions\n    Log(\"No optimal echo targets available\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely incorporates game-specific mechanics such as spell cooldowns,
    mana costs, and target positioning to determine the most effective number of Echo
    targets. The calculation may also consider the proximity of allies to the caster
    and their current health status to prioritize healing or damage amplification
    effects.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'caster' parameter points to a valid integer with meaningful
    data before calling this method, as invalid pointer values could lead to undefined
    behavior. Additionally, the ally count should represent actual active group members
    to avoid incorrect calculations.
