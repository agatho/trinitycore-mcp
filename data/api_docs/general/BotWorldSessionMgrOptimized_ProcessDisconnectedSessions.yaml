documentation:
  brief: Processes and cleans up disconnected bot sessions in the optimized world
    session manager.
  description: The ProcessDisconnectedSessions method iterates through all registered
    bot sessions and identifies those that have been disconnected from the game server.
    It performs necessary cleanup operations such as removing references to disconnected
    sessions, freeing associated resources, and updating internal tracking structures.
    This method is typically invoked during regular maintenance cycles or when session
    timeouts occur. The method ensures that disconnected bot sessions do not consume
    unnecessary memory or processing resources while maintaining the integrity of
    the overall session management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Maintenance Loop
    code: "void BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update\
      \ logic ...\n    ProcessDisconnectedSessions();\n    // ... continue with other\
      \ updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly as part of the session manager's maintenance
    routine to prevent memory leaks and ensure optimal performance. It is designed
    to be thread-safe and can be safely invoked from different execution contexts.
