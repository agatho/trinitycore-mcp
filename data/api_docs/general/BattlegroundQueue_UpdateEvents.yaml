documentation:
  brief: Updates battleground queue events and processes pending queue operations.
  description: The UpdateEvents method is responsible for processing and updating
    the state of battleground queues within the TrinityCore server. It handles time-based
    queue operations such as player matchmaking, queue timeouts, and status updates.
    This method is typically called from the main game loop at regular intervals to
    ensure that battleground queues are properly maintained and updated in real-time.
    The method processes all pending queue events and ensures that players are correctly
    matched into appropriate battleground instances based on their queue status and
    server settings.

      \    // ... other update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop with appropriate
    time deltas. It is thread-safe and can be safely invoked from any thread context
    where queue updates are required.
