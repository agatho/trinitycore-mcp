documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a new unique instance ID for a standalone scene.
  description: The GetNewStandaloneSceneInstanceID method is responsible for generating
    a new, unique identifier for a standalone scene within the TrinityCore framework.
    This identifier is used internally by the scene system to track and manage individual
    scene instances. The method ensures that each returned ID is distinct from previously
    generated IDs, preventing conflicts in scene management. It typically operates
    as part of the SceneMgr's internal ID allocation mechanism, which is crucial for
    maintaining proper scene state tracking and synchronization across the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing the newly generated unique
    instance ID for a standalone scene. This value is guaranteed to be unique within
    the current server session and should not be reused for other scene instances.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 newSceneId = sSceneMgr->GetNewStandaloneSceneInstanceID();

      // Use newSceneId to initialize a new standalone scene

      SceneInstance* instance = new SceneInstance(newSceneId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when creating new standalone scenes, and
    the returned ID should be stored immediately for later reference. The implementation
    likely uses an internal counter or similar mechanism to ensure uniqueness. This
    method is thread-safe as it's designed to be used in multi-threaded environments
    where multiple scene instances may be created concurrently.
