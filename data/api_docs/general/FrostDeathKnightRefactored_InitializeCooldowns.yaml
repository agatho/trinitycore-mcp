documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for all abilities and spells specific to the Frost
    Death Knight class
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and resets all cooldown timers
    for a Frost Death Knight character's abilities and spells. This method is typically
    called during character initialization, respawn, or when switching specs to ensure
    that all abilities start with their correct cooldown states. It configures internal
    cooldown tracking for abilities such as Howling Blast, Obliterate, Frost Strike,
    and other class-specific spells. The method ensures that the Death Knight's ability
    system is properly initialized before gameplay begins, preventing any unexpected
    behavior related to spell availability or timing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'FrostDeathKnightRefactored* dk = new FrostDeathKnightRefactored();

      dk->InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Player Login Context
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->getClass() == CLASS_DEATH_KNIGHT)\n\
      \    {\n        FrostDeathKnightRefactored* frostDK = new FrostDeathKnightRefactored(player);\n\
      \        frostDK->InitializeCooldowns();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a Frost Death Knight. It modifies internal state variables and should not be invoked
    repeatedly during gameplay as it may interfere with active cooldown tracking.
    The implementation likely uses the TrinityCore's spell cooldown system to properly
    set up timers.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during gameplay can cause unexpected
    behavior in spell cooldowns. Ensure that InitializeCooldowns is only called when
    initializing or resetting a Frost Death Knight's abilities, not during active
    combat or gameplay loops.
