    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a player has the minimum required reputation to accept a quest
  description: The ValidateMinimumReputation method checks whether the specified player
    meets the minimum reputation requirements for accepting a given quest. This validation
    is performed by querying the quest's reputation requirements against the player's
    current reputation levels with relevant factions. The method ensures that players
    cannot accept quests they do not meet the prerequisites for, maintaining game
    balance and progression integrity. It returns true if the player has sufficient
    reputation, or false otherwise. This check typically occurs during quest acceptance
    logic within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate reputation requirements
      for. Must correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose reputation
      is being validated against the quest requirements. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player has sufficient reputation to accept the quest,
    false otherwise. If the quest has no reputation requirements, the method returns
    true by default.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateMinimumReputation(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Player lacks required reputation\n    player->SendNotification(\"You do not\
      \ have sufficient reputation to accept this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateMinimumReputation(quest->GetQuestId(),\
      \ this)) {\n        SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REPUTATION);\n    \
      \    return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest acceptance logic\n   \
      \ AddQuest(quest->GetQuestId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the quest's reputation requirements stored in the database.
    The validation is performed using the player's current faction standings, which
    are updated through various game actions such as completing quests, killing mobs,
    or interacting with NPCs. This function does not modify any player state; it only
    performs a read-only check.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter corresponds to an actual quest in the
    database, otherwise behavior is undefined. The method assumes that the Player
    pointer is valid and not null, as passing a null pointer would result in a crash
    or undefined behavior.
