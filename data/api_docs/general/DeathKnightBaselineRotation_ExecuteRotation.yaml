  class: DeathKnightBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool DeathKnightBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target,
    BaselineRotationManager & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the baseline rotation logic for a Death Knight bot, determining
    the next spell or ability to cast based on current game state and target conditions.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method is the core function of the DeathKnightBaselineRotation
    class that implements the decision-making logic for a Death Knight AI bot. It
    evaluates the current combat situation, including player health, mana, target
    status, and available abilities, to determine the optimal action to take next.
    This method integrates with the BaselineRotationManager to coordinate rotation
    execution and ensure proper ability sequencing. The function returns true if a
    valid rotation step was executed successfully, or false if no suitable action
    could be determined. It is typically called during combat scenarios where the
    bot needs to make tactical decisions in real-time.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot's player data structure containing current state
      information such as health, mana, and available abilities.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target player or creature data structure that the
      bot is engaging in combat with.
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager instance that handles rotation
      state tracking, cooldown management, and ability prioritization.
  returns: Returns true if a successful rotation step was executed, indicating the
    bot took an appropriate action based on current conditions. Returns false if no
    valid action could be determined or if execution failed due to invalid parameters
    or game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (me->IsInCombat()) {\n        int\
      \ botData[10];\n        int targetData[10];\n        BaselineRotationManager\
      \ manager;\n        DeathKnightBaselineRotation rotation;\n        \n      \
      \  if (!rotation.ExecuteRotation(botData, targetData, manager)) {\n        \
      \    // Handle case where no action was taken\n            return;\n       \
      \ }\n        // Continue with AI logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot and target data structures are properly
    initialized before calling. The BaselineRotationManager must be correctly configured
    with ability priorities and cooldown information for optimal performance. Implementation
    may involve complex state checks and should be called only during active combat
    situations to avoid unnecessary processing.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of bot and target parameters
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the BaselineRotationManager
    is properly synchronized with the current game state before execution. Avoid calling
    this method outside of combat contexts as it may cause performance degradation
    or incorrect AI decisions.
