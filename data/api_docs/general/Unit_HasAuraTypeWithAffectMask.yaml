  signature: bool Unit::HasAuraTypeWithAffectMask(int auraType, const SpellInfo *
    affectedSpell) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has a specific aura type with affect mask.
  description: This method determines whether a Unit object possesses a particular
    aura type that is associated with a specific spell's affect mask. It evaluates
    the presence of an aura type within the context of a given spell, allowing for
    precise detection of active effects on the unit. The method is commonly used in
    game mechanics to verify conditional states or effects applied by spells, such
    as checking for debuffs or buffs that may influence gameplay behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: auraType
    description: The aura type to check for, typically representing a specific effect
      like periodic damage, stat modifiers, or control over the unit.
  - name: affectedSpell
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure that defines the spell whose affect
      mask is being checked against the aura type.
  returns: Returns true if the unit has the specified aura type with the given affected
    spell's affect mask, otherwise false.

      \ {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core gameplay mechanics for checking active aura
    effects on units. It should be used carefully in conjunction with other aura-related
    methods to ensure accurate detection of specific spell effects.
  warnings: The method requires a valid SpellInfo pointer; passing nullptr may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the spell information is properly
    initialized before calling this method.
