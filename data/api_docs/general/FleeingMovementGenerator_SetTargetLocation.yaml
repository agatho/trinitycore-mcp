  class: FleeingMovementGenerator
  method: SetTargetLocation
  signature: void FleeingMovementGenerator::SetTargetLocation(int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the fleeing movement generator's target location based on the provided
    owner pointer.
  description: The SetTargetLocation method is used to configure the destination point
    for a creature or unit that is currently fleeing from an enemy. This method calculates
    and sets the flee path towards a specific target location, typically derived from
    the owner's current position or a designated escape point. It is part of the movement
    behavior system in TrinityCore, enabling NPCs to perform realistic flee mechanics
    when under threat. The method does not directly move the unit but prepares the
    movement generator for execution during the next update cycle. This functionality
    is commonly used in combat AI systems where creatures need to retreat from dangerous
    situations.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SetTargetLocation
    code: 'FleeingMovementGenerator fleeGen;

      Unit* owner = player->GetVictim();

      fleeGen.SetTargetLocation(nullptr); // Uses internal logic to determine target
      location based on owner'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a creature
    begins fleeing. The actual movement execution occurs in subsequent update cycles,
    not immediately upon calling this method. Developers should ensure that any referenced
    units or positions are valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling SetTargetLocation with an invalid owner pointer may lead to memory
    access violations or incorrect flee path calculations. This method assumes the
    movement generator has been properly initialized and is in a valid state for fleeing
    behavior.
