  class: ScopedPerformanceMeasurement
  method: RecordMetric
  signature: void ScopedPerformanceMeasurement::RecordMetric(const std::string & name,
    float value)
documentation:
  brief: Records a performance metric with the specified name and value for profiling
    and monitoring purposes.
  description: The RecordMetric method is used to log performance-related data within
    the TrinityCore framework. It allows developers to track various metrics such
    as execution times, memory usage, or other relevant performance indicators during
    runtime. This functionality is typically employed in debugging, optimization,
    and system monitoring scenarios. The method accepts a metric name as a string
    identifier and a floating-point value representing the measured quantity. These
    recorded metrics can later be retrieved or analyzed for performance tuning and
    diagnostics.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for the metric being recorded. This name
      should be descriptive and consistent to allow meaningful analysis of collected
      data.
  - name: value
    description: The numerical value associated with the metric. Typically represents
      a measurement such as time in seconds, memory usage in bytes, or count of operations
      performed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ScopedPerformanceMeasurement perf;

      perf.RecordMetric("SpellCastTime", 0.5f);

      perf.RecordMetric("MovementSpeed", 12.3f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Metrics in a Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(float deltaTime)\n{\n    ScopedPerformanceMeasurement\
      \ perf;\n    perf.RecordMetric(\"FrameTime\", deltaTime);\n    // ... game update\
      \ logic ...\n    perf.RecordMetric(\"UpdateObjects\", 0.02f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a scoped performance measurement system, suggesting
    it's designed to work in conjunction with other timing or profiling mechanisms.
    It likely integrates with TrinityCore's internal performance monitoring infrastructure
    for logging and analysis.
