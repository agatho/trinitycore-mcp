  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: UpdateCharacterCache
  signature: void BotCharacterSelector::UpdateCharacterCache(uint32 accountId, const
    int & characters)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the character cache for a specified account with the provided character
    data.
  description: The UpdateCharacterCache method is responsible for refreshing or initializing
    the cached list of characters associated with a given account ID. This method
    ensures that the bot system maintains an up-to-date view of available characters
    for the specified account, which is essential for proper bot behavior and character
    management within the TrinityCore framework. The method likely interacts with
    the database to fetch current character information and stores it in memory for
    quick access during bot operations. It's typically invoked when a bot needs to
    know what characters are available under an account or when character data changes.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account whose character cache needs
      to be updated. This value corresponds to the 'id' field in the 'account' table
      of the TrinityCore database.
  - name: characters
    description: A reference to an integer representing the number of characters associated
      with the specified account. This parameter may be used to validate or set the
      character count in the cache, though its exact usage depends on internal implementation
      details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      uint32 accountId = 12345;

      int characterCount = 3;

      selector.UpdateCharacterCache(accountId, characterCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot management system and may be called
    automatically when bots are initialized or when account data changes. The cache
    update process might involve database queries and should be optimized to avoid
    performance bottlenecks in high-traffic environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the accountId parameter corresponds to an existing account
    in the database, otherwise the method may fail silently or produce incorrect results.
    Also, be cautious about calling this method too frequently as it could lead to
    unnecessary database load.
