  method: Shutdown
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Stops and cleans up all active NPC interaction processes within the manager.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing NPC interactions managed
    by the NPCInteractionManager instance. It ensures that any pending or active interactions
    are properly closed and resources are released. This method is typically called
    during server shutdown or when the manager needs to be reset. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs no return operations, making it a simple
    cleanup function. It should only be invoked when all interaction sessions are
    safely concluded to prevent data corruption or dangling references.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* manager = new NPCInteractionManager();

      // ... perform interactions ...

      manager->Shutdown();

      delete manager;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not be called concurrently
    with other interaction methods. It assumes that no external threads are actively
    using the manager during its execution.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while active interactions are in progress may lead to
    unexpected behavior or resource leaks if those interactions are not properly synchronized
    before shutdown.
