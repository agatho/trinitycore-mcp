documentation:
  brief: Casts legacy buffs specific to the Monk class AI.
  description: The CastLegacyBuffs method is responsible for applying or casting buff
    spells that are considered legacy or traditional for the Monk AI. This method
    typically handles the logic of determining which buffs should be applied based
    on the current state of the Monk, such as health, mana levels, or combat status.
    It may also include checks to ensure buffs are not already active before casting
    them. The implementation is part of the general AI behavior for Monks within TrinityCore's
    framework and ensures that the AI follows class-specific gameplay mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage in Monk AI Context
    code: "void SomeMonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic\n    CastLegacyBuffs();\n\
      \    // Continue with other actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during the AI update cycle, and it should be
    used carefully to avoid redundant buff casting. The actual spell selection and
    conditions for casting are determined by internal logic within the MonkAI class.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called too frequently to prevent spamming
    of buff spells or performance issues. Also, make sure that the AI has proper checks
    in place to avoid applying buffs when they are already active.
