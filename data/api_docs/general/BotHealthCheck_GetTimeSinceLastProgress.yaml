  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: GetTimeSinceLastProgress
  signature: uint32 BotHealthCheck::GetTimeSinceLastProgress() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time elapsed since the last bot progress update
    in milliseconds.
  description: The GetTimeSinceLastProgress method determines how much time has passed,
    in milliseconds, since the last recorded progress update for a bot. This is typically
    used within the context of AI behavior to monitor bot activity or determine if
    a bot has become stuck or inactive. The method relies on an internal timestamp
    that is updated whenever the bot's progress changes. It provides a simple way
    to measure bot responsiveness and can be used in conjunction with other health
    checks to assess overall bot performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of milliseconds elapsed
    since the last progress update. A return value of 0 indicates that no progress
    has been recorded yet, or the timestamp was reset.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Bot Activity
    code: "uint32 timeSinceLastProgress = botHealthCheck.GetTimeSinceLastProgress();\n\
      if (timeSinceLastProgress > 30000) // 30 seconds\n{\n    // Bot may be stuck\
      \ or inactive\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Bot has not made progress for\
      \ %u ms\", timeSinceLastProgress);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Time Since Last Progress in AI Decision Making
    code: "uint32 elapsed = botHealthCheck.GetTimeSinceLastProgress();\nif (elapsed\
      \ > 60000) // 1 minute\n{\n    // Trigger a reset or alternative behavior\n\
      \    bot->ResetAI();\n}\nelse if (elapsed > 30000)\n{\n    // Log warning but\
      \ continue normal operation\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot progress paused for %u\
      \ ms\", elapsed);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal timestamp is properly maintained and
    updated by other parts of the bot health system. It's important to ensure that
    progress updates are consistently tracked to maintain accurate timing.
  warnings: The returned value may not be reliable if the internal timestamp has been
    manually reset or manipulated. Additionally, this method does not account for
    system clock adjustments that could affect time calculations.
