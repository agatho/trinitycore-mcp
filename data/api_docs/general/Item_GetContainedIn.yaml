  class: Item
  method: GetContainedIn
  signature: int Item::GetContainedIn() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the item's container ID, indicating where it is stored within the
    player's inventory.
  description: The GetContainedIn method retrieves the identifier of the container
    that holds this item. It returns the GUID of the container in which the item is
    located, or 0 if the item is not contained within any container. This method is
    essential for understanding item positioning within the game's inventory system
    and helps determine whether an item is in a bag, equipped, or in the player's
    main inventory. The returned value represents the container's GUID, which can
    be used to identify the specific container slot or bag where the item resides.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the GUID of the container that holds this item, or 0 if the item
    is not contained within any container. This value corresponds to the container's
    ID in the game world and can be used to determine the item's location within the
    player's inventory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID(12345);\nint containerId = item->GetContainedIn();\n\
      if (containerId != 0)\n{\n    // Item is contained in a bag\n    printf(\"Item\
      \ is in container: %d\\n\", containerId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Item is not in\
      \ any container\n    printf(\"Item is in main inventory\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the item's internal tracking mechanism and should
    be used carefully when determining item placement. Performance considerations
    include checking for valid container IDs to avoid unnecessary overhead. Thread
    safety is not an issue as this method does not modify any data.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method, as it may return 0 if the item is
    not contained in a bag, which could lead to confusion if not properly handled.
    Also note that the returned value represents a GUID and not a slot number, so
    it's important to distinguish between container IDs and slot numbers.
