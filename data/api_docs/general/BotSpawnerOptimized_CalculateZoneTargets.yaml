  method: CalculateZoneTargets
  signature: void BotSpawnerOptimized::CalculateZoneTargets()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the list of valid target zones for bot spawning within
    the current map context.
  description: The CalculateZoneTargets method determines which zones in the current
    map are eligible for bot spawning based on various criteria such as player density,
    zone flags, and spawn restrictions. This method is typically invoked during initialization
    or when map data changes to ensure that bots are only spawned in appropriate areas.
    It evaluates each zone's suitability by checking against configured thresholds
    and game rules, updating internal tracking structures with valid spawn zones.
    The calculated targets are used by the bot spawner system to determine where new
    bots should be placed.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Spawner Initialization
    code: "void MyBotSpawner::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    CalculateZoneTargets(); // Populate valid spawn zones\n    // Continue\
      \ with bot spawning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full recalculation of zone targets and may have performance
    implications if called frequently. It should typically be invoked only when necessary,
    such as during map loading or configuration changes. The method relies on current
    map data and player activity levels to make decisions.
