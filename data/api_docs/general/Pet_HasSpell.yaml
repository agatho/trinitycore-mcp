  signature: bool Pet::HasSpell(uint32 spell) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the pet has a specific spell in its spell book.
  description: The HasSpell method determines whether a given spell is currently available
    to the pet. This check includes all spells that the pet can cast, including those
    learned through training, summoned from items, or granted by abilities. The method
    performs a lookup within the pet's active spell list and returns true if the specified
    spell ID exists in that list, otherwise false. This functionality is commonly
    used in AI scripts, spell validation, and pet behavior logic to ensure proper
    spell usage and prevent invalid actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the pet has the specified spell in its spell book; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Check
    code: "if (pet->HasSpell(132)) {\n    // Pet knows the 'Detect Hidden' spell\n\
      \    pet->CastSpell(target, 132, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Usage
    code: "if (pet->HasSpell(781)) {\n    // Pet knows 'Disengage' - use it when low\
      \ health\n    if (pet->GetHealthPct() < 30) {\n        pet->CastSpell(pet, 781,\
      \ true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method checks against the pet's current spell list, which may differ
    from its initial creature template spells. Spells learned through training or
    temporary effects will be included in this check. The method does not validate
    if the spell is currently usable (e.g., cooldowns, mana requirements), only that
    it exists in the spell book.
  warnings: Be aware that some spells might be removed from a pet's spell list during
    combat or specific events. This method should not be used as a sole validation
    for spell casting without additional checks for castability conditions like mana,
    range, or target validity.
