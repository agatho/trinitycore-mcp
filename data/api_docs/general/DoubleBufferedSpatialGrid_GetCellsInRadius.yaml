  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: GetCellsInRadius
  signature: int DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GetCellsInRadius(const int & center, float
    radius) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of grid cells within the specified radius
    from a given center cell.
  description: The GetCellsInRadius method determines how many grid cells fall within
    a circular area defined by a center cell and a radius. This is commonly used in
    spatial partitioning systems to efficiently query nearby objects or areas. The
    method operates on a double-buffered spatial grid structure, which allows for
    consistent querying during updates. It's particularly useful for determining visibility,
    collision detection, or proximity-based interactions in game environments. The
    calculation accounts for the grid's cell size and layout to ensure accurate coverage
    of the specified radius.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The index of the center grid cell from which to calculate the radius.
      This represents a specific location within the spatial grid structure.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius in grid units defining the area around the center cell
      to query. Must be non-negative; negative values may produce unexpected results.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the total number of grid cells that fall
    within the specified radius from the center cell. A value of zero indicates no
    cells are within range, while a positive value indicates the count of cells in
    the area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int cellCount = grid.GetCellsInRadius(100, 5.0f); // Get number of cells
      within radius 5 from cell 100
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Result for Iteration
    code: "int centerCell = 50;\nfloat radius = 3.0f;\nint count = grid.GetCellsInRadius(centerCell,\
      \ radius);\n// Use count to allocate memory or iterate through cells\nfor (int\
      \ i = 0; i < count; ++i)\n{\n    // Process each cell in the radius\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes a uniform grid layout and does not account for irregular
    shapes or non-uniform cell sizes. The implementation likely uses a circle-sweep
    algorithm to determine coverage, which may involve floating-point calculations
    that could introduce minor inaccuracies at boundaries. Since this is part of a
    double-buffered system, it provides consistent results even during concurrent
    updates.
  warnings: Ensure the center parameter refers to a valid grid cell index; invalid
    indices may cause undefined behavior. The radius parameter should be carefully
    managed to avoid excessive computation or memory allocation when dealing with
    large radii. Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical sections
    as it may involve iterative calculations over potentially many cells.
