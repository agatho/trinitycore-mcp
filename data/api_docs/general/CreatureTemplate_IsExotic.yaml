documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature template is classified as exotic based on its
    difficulty settings.
  description: The IsExotic method checks if a creature template is marked as exotic,
    which typically indicates that the creature has special properties or behaviors
    not found in standard creatures. This determination is made by evaluating the
    creature's difficulty settings against predefined criteria within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method considers various factors such as creature type, level,
    and other attributes that define whether it should be treated as an exotic creature
    in gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature template is classified as exotic; otherwise
    returns false. An exotic creature may have different AI behaviors, loot tables,
    or encounter mechanics compared to regular creatures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CreatureTemplate* template = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (template && template->IsExotic(nullptr)) {\n    // Handle exotic creature\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"Creature is exotic\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Difficulty Context
    code: "CreatureTemplate* template = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(12345);\n\
      CreatureDifficulty* difficulty = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureDifficulty(12345, 1);\
      \ // Normal difficulty\nif (template && template->IsExotic(difficulty)) {\n\
      \    // Apply exotic-specific behavior\n    printf(\"Creature is exotic for\
      \ this difficulty\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal flags or attributes set during database
    loading or configuration. The 'creatureDifficulty' parameter may be used to determine
    if the creature's exotic status varies by difficulty level, though in many cases
    it might be ignored for basic checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the CreatureTemplate pointer is valid before calling this
    method to avoid null pointer dereferences. The behavior of IsExotic with different
    difficulty contexts should be tested thoroughly as exotic status may vary across
    difficulty levels.
