documentation:
  brief: Stops the background processing thread used by the bot profiler.
  description: The StopBackgroundProcessing method terminates the background thread
    that is responsible for profiling bot activities in TrinityCore. This method ensures
    that all ongoing profiling operations are gracefully stopped and any resources
    allocated for background processing are properly released. It is typically called
    when shutting down or disabling the bot profiler functionality to prevent memory
    leaks or undefined behavior. The method does not take any parameters and has no
    return value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotProfiler::StopBackgroundProcessing();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after ensuring that no other threads are
    actively using the profiler. It is recommended to call this method before destructing
    the BotProfiler instance to avoid potential race conditions or resource leaks.
