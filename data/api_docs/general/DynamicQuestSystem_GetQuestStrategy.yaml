  signature: QuestStrategy DynamicQuestSystem::GetQuestStrategy(uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quest strategy associated with a specific bot GUID
  description: The GetQuestStrategy method retrieves the quest strategy that is currently
    assigned to a bot identified by its unique global identifier (GUID). This method
    is typically used in dynamic quest systems where bots need to follow specific
    strategies for quest completion. The returned QuestStrategy object contains information
    about how the bot should approach and handle quests, including priorities, behaviors,
    and decision-making rules. The method assumes that a valid strategy has been previously
    assigned to the bot through other system functions.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to retrieve
      the quest strategy. This value must correspond to an existing bot in the system
      and should be a valid uint32 value representing the bot's identifier.
  returns: Returns a QuestStrategy object that defines how the specified bot should
    approach and handle quests. If no strategy is assigned to the bot, the method
    may return a default or empty strategy, or potentially throw an exception depending
    on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 botGUID = 12345;

      QuestStrategy strategy = dynamicQuestSystem.GetQuestStrategy(botGUID);

      // Use the retrieved strategy for quest handling logic'
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy Validation
    code: "uint32 botGUID = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nQuestStrategy strategy\
      \ = dynamicQuestSystem.GetQuestStrategy(botGUID);\nif (strategy.IsValid()) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with quest handling using the strategy\n    strategy.ExecuteQuestLogic(player);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where no valid strategy exists\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"\
      quest\", \"No valid quest strategy found for bot %u\", botGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger dynamic quest system that manages
    bot behavior in World of Warcraft. The implementation may involve internal lookups
    or caching mechanisms to efficiently retrieve strategies. Developers should ensure
    that bots have valid strategies assigned before calling this method, as missing
    strategies could lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or exceptions. Ensure that the bot GUID corresponds to a
    valid bot entity in the system before invoking this method. The returned QuestStrategy
    object should be validated for validity before use.
