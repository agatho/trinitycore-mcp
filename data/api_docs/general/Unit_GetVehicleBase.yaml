  signature: Unit * Unit::GetVehicleBase() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the vehicle base unit that the current unit is mounted on.
  description: This method retrieves the base unit of a vehicle that the current unit
    is currently mounted on. It provides access to the vehicle's base unit, which
    represents the parent unit that the vehicle is attached to. The method is commonly
    used in vehicle-related gameplay mechanics where units need to interact with their
    vehicle base for various operations such as mounting, dismounting, or accessing
    vehicle properties. This functionality is particularly important in World of Warcraft's
    vehicle system where players and NPCs can be mounted on vehicles.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit that serves as the vehicle base. If the unit
    is not currently mounted on a vehicle, this will return nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Base Access
    code: "Unit* vehicleBase = unit->GetVehicleBase();\nif (vehicleBase)\n{\n    //\
      \ Unit is mounted on a vehicle\n    // Do something with the vehicle base\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Unit is not mounted on any vehicle\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the vehicle system implementation and should be used
    carefully when dealing with vehicle-related operations. The returned pointer may
    be nullptr if no vehicle base exists, which can happen when units are not mounted
    on vehicles or when vehicle data hasn't been properly initialized.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can return nullptr if the unit
    is not mounted on a vehicle. Always check for null before dereferencing the returned
    pointer to avoid crashes or undefined behavior.
