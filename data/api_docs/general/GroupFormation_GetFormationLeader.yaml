  class: GroupFormation
  method: GetFormationLeader
  signature: uint32 GroupFormation::GetFormationLeader() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the group formation leader.
  description: The GetFormationLeader method retrieves the globally unique identifier
    of the player who is designated as the leader of a group formation. In World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, group formations are used to manage how players
    move and interact in organized groups, such as raids or dungeons. This method
    allows access to the leader's GUID, which can be used for various purposes including
    validation, communication, or controlling group behavior. The returned value represents
    a 32-bit unsigned integer that uniquely identifies the formation leader within
    the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the globally unique identifier (GUID) of the
    group formation leader. If no formation leader is set, this method may return
    zero or trigger an assertion in debug builds.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Formation Leader GUID
    code: "uint32 leaderGuid = groupFormation->GetFormationLeader();\nif (leaderGuid\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Use the leader GUID for further operations\n    Player* leader\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(MAKE_NEW_GUID(leaderGuid, 0, HIGHGUID_PLAYER));\n\
      \    if (leader)\n    {\n        // Perform actions with the formation leader\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in group management systems and should be called
    only when a valid group formation exists. The GUID returned corresponds to the
    player's identifier in the game world database, which can be used with ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer()
    to retrieve the actual Player object.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupFormation object is properly initialized before calling
    this method. Calling GetFormationLeader on an uninitialized or invalid formation
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect GUID values.
