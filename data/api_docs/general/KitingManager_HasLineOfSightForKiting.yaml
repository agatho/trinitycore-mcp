  class: KitingManager
  method: HasLineOfSightForKiting
  signature: bool KitingManager::HasLineOfSightForKiting(const int & from, const int
    & to)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a kiting path between two points has unobstructed line
    of sight for movement.
  description: The HasLineOfSightForKiting method evaluates if there is a clear, unblocked
    path between two specified points in the game world that would allow for kiting
    behavior. This function is typically used by AI systems to determine valid movement
    routes for creatures or players engaged in kiting mechanics, which involves maintaining
    distance from an enemy while dealing damage. The method likely performs raycasting
    or line-of-sight checks against environment obstacles such as walls, terrain,
    and other solid objects. It ensures that the path between the 'from' and 'to'
    coordinates does not intersect with any blocking geometry, making it suitable
    for kiting strategies where direct movement is required.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting point identifier or index for kiting movement. This
      value typically represents a node or position in the kiting path system.
  - name: to
    description: The destination point identifier or index for kiting movement. This
      value typically represents a node or position in the kiting path system.
  returns: Returns true if there is an unobstructed line of sight between the 'from'
    and 'to' points, allowing kiting movement; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check kiting path validity
    code: "if (kitingManager.HasLineOfSightForKiting(1, 5)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ kiting movement from point 1 to 5\n    player->MoveTo(5);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Find alternative path or wait\n    player->Wait();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a kiting AI loop
    code: "while (player->IsInCombat()) {\n    int currentPoint = GetCurrentKitingPoint();\n\
      \    int nextPoint = GetNextKitingPoint(currentPoint);\n    \n    if (kitingManager.HasLineOfSightForKiting(currentPoint,\
      \ nextPoint)) {\n        player->MoveTo(nextPoint);\n    } else {\n        //\
      \ Handle obstruction by finding a detour\n        FindAlternativePath(currentPoint,\
      \ nextPoint);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely performance-critical in AI systems and may utilize
    spatial partitioning or caching mechanisms to optimize repeated checks. It's recommended
    to cache results when checking the same paths multiple times during a single kiting
    sequence.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'from' and 'to' parameters are valid indices or identifiers
    within the kiting system's defined range; invalid values may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect path validation.
