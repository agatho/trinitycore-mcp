  method: GetAuraEffect
  signature: const AuraEffect * AreaTrigger::GetAuraEffect() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the aura effect associated with the area trigger.
  description: The GetAuraEffect method returns a pointer to the AuraEffect object
    that is linked to the area trigger. This method allows access to the specific
    aura effect properties and data that governs how the area trigger behaves within
    the game world. It is commonly used in conjunction with area trigger events to
    determine the effects applied to players or creatures entering the trigger's influence.
    The returned pointer may be null if no aura effect has been assigned to the area
    trigger.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an AuraEffect object representing the aura effect
    associated with this area trigger, or nullptr if no aura effect is present.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Aura Effect from Area Trigger
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume we have a valid area trigger\nconst\
      \ AuraEffect* auraEffect = trigger->GetAuraEffect();\nif (auraEffect)\n{\n \
      \   // Use the aura effect data\n    uint32 spellId = auraEffect->GetSpellInfo()->Id;\n\
      \    int32 amount = auraEffect->GetAmount();\n    // Process aura effect properties\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during area trigger activation events to inspect
    or apply the effects defined by the aura. The returned AuraEffect pointer should
    not be modified directly as it represents internal game state data.
