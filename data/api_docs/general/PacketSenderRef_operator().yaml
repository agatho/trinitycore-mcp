documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to the specified player using the internal packet sender reference.
  description: The PacketSenderRef::operator() method is a function call operator
    that facilitates sending network packets to a specific player within the TrinityCore
    server environment. This method acts as a wrapper around the underlying packet
    sending mechanism, allowing for efficient and type-safe transmission of game data
    to connected clients. The method takes a pointer to an integer representing the
    player's identifier and uses it to determine the target recipient of the packet.
    It is typically used in scenarios where packets need to be dispatched to specific
    players based on dynamic conditions or game events.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID)
      of the player to whom the packet should be sent. The value must be a valid player
      GUID or nullptr to indicate no target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a packet to a specific player
    code: 'PacketSenderRef sender;

      int playerId = 12345;

      sender(&playerId); // Sends packet to player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending a packet to a player using a variable GUID
    code: 'PacketSenderRef sender;

      int* targetPlayer = new int(67890);

      sender(targetPlayer); // Sends packet to player with GUID 67890

      delete targetPlayer;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's internal networking infrastructure
    and should be used carefully in performance-critical sections. The operator()
    function is typically invoked from within game logic or event handlers where targeted
    packet delivery is required.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an active player session, otherwise the packet may not be delivered correctly.
    Avoid calling this method with nullptr as it could lead to undefined behavior
    or failed packet transmission.
