  signature: void MovementGeneratorDeleter::operator()(MovementGenerator * a)
documentation:
  brief: Deletes a MovementGenerator object pointed to by the given pointer.
  description: The operator() method in the MovementGeneratorDeleter class is a function
    call operator that serves as a custom deleter for smart pointers managing MovementGenerator
    objects. It is typically used with std::unique_ptr or similar smart pointer containers
    to ensure proper cleanup of MovementGenerator instances when they go out of scope
    or are explicitly deleted. This deletion mechanism allows for controlled memory
    management within the TrinityCore framework, particularly in systems that handle
    dynamic movement behaviors for game entities such as players and creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: a
    description: A pointer to the MovementGenerator object that needs to be deleted.
      The pointer must be valid and point to a properly constructed MovementGenerator
      instance; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage with std::unique_ptr
    code: 'std::unique_ptr<MovementGenerator, MovementGeneratorDeleter> mg_ptr(new
      MovementGenerator());

      // The destructor of mg_ptr will automatically call operator() on the deleter

      // which deletes the underlying MovementGenerator object.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Deletion via Deleter
    code: 'MovementGeneratorDeleter deleter;

      MovementGenerator* mg = new MovementGenerator();

      deleter(mg); // Explicitly calls the deleter to clean up the object

      mg = nullptr; // Ensure no dangling pointer remains'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a custom deleter pattern and should only be used with
    objects that are allocated using new. It assumes the input pointer was created
    via new and not from other memory allocation mechanisms like malloc or placement
    new. The class itself is likely defined as a functor (function object) to be used
    with smart pointers.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers to this method without checking for validity
    first, as it will attempt to delete a null pointer which leads to undefined behavior.
    Also, ensure that the MovementGenerator object pointed to has been allocated using
    new and not any other memory management technique.
