  class: SmartAI
  method: SetFollow
  signature: void SmartAI::SetFollow(Unit * target, float dist, float angle, uint32
    credit, uint32 end, uint32 creditType)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a follow behavior for the AI unit towards a specified target with
    optional quest credit and end conditions.
  description: The SetFollow method configures the SmartAI to begin following a target
    Unit with defined distance, angle, and optional quest-related parameters. This
    function is typically used in AI scripts to make NPCs follow players or other
    units under specific conditions. The method sets up internal tracking for the
    follow behavior including distance thresholds, angular constraints, and quest
    credit triggers. It does not immediately start movement but prepares the AI state
    for following. When the target moves beyond the specified distance or angle, the
    follow behavior may be interrupted or re-evaluated based on the AI's configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The Unit object that this AI will follow. Must be a valid pointer
      to a Unit; null pointers are not handled gracefully and may cause undefined
      behavior.
  - name: dist
    description: Maximum distance in yards from the target unit at which the AI will
      continue following. If the target moves beyond this distance, the follow behavior
      may end or be re-evaluated.
  - name: angle
    description: Angular offset in radians from the target's facing direction within
      which the AI will maintain follow. Values typically range from 0 to 2*PI (full
      circle).
  - name: credit
    description: Quest credit ID that is triggered when the follow behavior completes
      successfully. This value is used to track quest progress and may be zero if
      no quest credit is required.
  - name: end
    description: End condition identifier that determines when the follow behavior
      terminates. Values are typically defined by the AI system or quest framework
      and may include flags for distance, time, or event-based termination.
  - name: creditType
    description: Type of quest credit to be awarded upon successful completion of
      the follow. This value determines how the quest system interprets the credit
      (e.g., kill credit, item credit, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Follow Setup
    code: 'SmartAI* ai = creature->GetAI();

      Unit* target = player;

      ai->SetFollow(target, 10.0f, 0.0f, 12345, 0, 1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Follow with Angular Constraint
    code: 'SmartAI* ai = creature->GetAI();

      Unit* target = player;

      ai->SetFollow(target, 15.0f, M_PI / 4, 12346, 1, 2); // 45 degree angular constraint'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal AI state and should be called when the AI is
    in a stable state. The follow behavior will only activate once the AI's next update
    cycle. Ensure that the target unit remains valid throughout the follow duration
    to prevent crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing null for the 'target' parameter can lead to crashes or unpredictable
    behavior. Always validate that the target is alive and valid before calling this
    method. The distance and angle parameters must be carefully chosen to avoid unintended
    behavior in complex environments.
