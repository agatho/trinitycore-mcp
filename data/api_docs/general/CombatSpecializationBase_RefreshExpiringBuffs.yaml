  brief: Refreshes expiring buffs for the combat specialization, renewing their duration.
  description: The RefreshExpiringBuffs method is responsible for updating and extending
    the duration of buffs that are about to expire within the context of a combat
    specialization. This method ensures that active buff effects remain functional
    by resetting their timers or applying renewal mechanics as defined by the specialization's
    rules. It typically operates on a set of tracked buffs that have a limited duration,
    such as those from abilities, talents, or gear effects. The method is commonly
    invoked during combat updates or when specific conditions are met to maintain
    optimal performance and gameplay balance.

    code: "void MyCombatSystem::Update()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n \
      \   _specialization->RefreshExpiringBuffs();\n    // ... continue with update\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure that
    buff durations are properly maintained. It is recommended to avoid calling this
    method outside of combat contexts unless explicitly required by custom logic.
