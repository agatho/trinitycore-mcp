  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: IsBotAvailable
  signature: bool LFGBotSelector::IsBotAvailable(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified bot player is available for LFG grouping.
  description: The IsBotAvailable method determines if a given bot player is currently
    eligible and available to be selected for a Looking For Group (LFG) activity.
    This function evaluates the bot's current state, including whether it is in a
    valid location, not engaged in other activities, and meets the requirements for
    LFG participation. It ensures that only appropriate bots are considered when forming
    groups through the LFG system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot to check for availability.
      Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot is available for LFG grouping, false
    otherwise. A bot may be marked as unavailable due to being in combat, in a dungeon,
    or otherwise occupied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot\nif (selector.IsBotAvailable(myBot))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with LFG group formation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with LFG System
    code: "LFGBotSelector selector;\nfor (auto& bot : botList) {\n    if (selector.IsBotAvailable(bot))\
      \ {\n        // Add to available bots list for group creation\n        availableBots.push_back(bot);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal bot state tracking within the TrinityCore
    framework. It is recommended to call this method before attempting to assign a
    bot to an LFG group to prevent invalid operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and points
    to an actual bot instance, as passing a null or invalid pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior.
