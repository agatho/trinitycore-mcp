  class: BotLifecycleMgr
  method: Update
  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot lifecycle management system by processing pending operations
    and state changes.
  description: The Update method in BotLifecycleMgr is responsible for driving the
    core logic of bot lifecycle management. It processes queued bot operations, handles
    state transitions, manages resource allocation, and ensures proper synchronization
    between bots and their associated player characters. This method is typically
    called from the game loop at regular intervals to maintain consistent bot behavior
    and prevent resource leaks. The implementation likely includes checks for bot
    timeouts, cleanup of inactive bots, and updates to bot AI states based on current
    game conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time elapsed since last update in milliseconds. Used to determine
      how much time has passed for processing bot lifecycle events and state transitions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    sBotLifecycleMgr->Update(diff);\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void World::UpdateWorld()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    sBotLifecycleMgr->Update(diff);\n\
      \    // ... continue with other world updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop to ensure
    proper bot lifecycle management. The 'diff' parameter is crucial for time-based
    calculations and should accurately reflect the time passed since the last call.
    Implementation may involve locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions when
    accessing shared bot data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper timing control or with incorrect diff
    values can lead to inconsistent bot behavior, resource leaks, or synchronization
    issues. Ensure that the diff parameter represents actual elapsed time for accurate
    processing.
