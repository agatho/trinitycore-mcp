  signature: void Creature::SetCannotReachTarget(bool cannotReach)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether a creature can reach its target or not.
  description: This method controls the creature's ability to reach its target during
    combat. When set to true, the creature will be unable to reach its target, typically
    used in scenarios where the creature needs to maintain distance from its target.
    This is commonly used for creatures that need to avoid melee combat or when implementing
    specific AI behaviors where reaching the target would cause issues with game mechanics.
