  class: EvokerAI
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool EvokerAI::CanUseAbility(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an evoker AI can use a specified spell ability based on
    current game state and cooldowns.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a given spell ID is available
    for use by an EvokerAI instance. It checks various conditions such as spell cooldowns,
    resource requirements, target validity, and combat state to determine usability.
    This method is crucial for AI decision-making in evoker class behavior, ensuring
    that abilities are only used when appropriate according to game mechanics and
    rules. The method typically integrates with the broader AI system to make dynamic
    tactical decisions during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell ability to check for usability.
      This should correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell can be used according to current AI
    state and game conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spell availability
    code: "if (evokerAI->CanUseAbility(12345)) {\n    evokerAI->CastSpell(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional logic for ability selection
    code: "uint32 bestSpell = 0;\nif (evokerAI->CanUseAbility(12345)) {\n    bestSpell\
      \ = 12345;\n} else if (evokerAI->CanUseAbility(12346)) {\n    bestSpell = 12346;\n\
      }\nif (bestSpell != 0) {\n    evokerAI->CastSpell(bestSpell);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal cooldown tracking, mana/resource
    pools, and target validation systems. It may also consider the AI's current phase
    or encounter state to make decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that spellId corresponds to a valid spell in the game database;
    invalid IDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect return values.
