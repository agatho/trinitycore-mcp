documentation:
  brief: Optimizes role distribution within a group for combat positioning.
  description: The OptimizeRoleDistribution method analyzes the current composition
    of a group and adjusts player roles to improve combat effectiveness. It evaluates
    each group member's class, specialization, and current role assignment to determine
    optimal positioning strategies. This method ensures that tanks, healers, and damage
    dealers are distributed in a way that maximizes the group's overall combat performance.
    The optimization process considers factors such as player availability, role balance,
    and positional requirements for specific encounters. This method is typically
    called during group formation or when significant changes occur in group composition.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup && myGroup->IsInWorld())\n\
      {\n    RoleBasedCombatPositioning::OptimizeRoleDistribution(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on groups that are actively in the world
    and have valid members. The optimization process may modify existing role assignments,
    so it's recommended to call this method before critical combat encounters. Performance
    impact is minimal as it only processes group members when necessary.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null or invalid group pointer will result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure the group is properly initialized and contains valid
    players before invoking this method. This method may override existing role assignments
    without warning, so use caution in scripted scenarios.
