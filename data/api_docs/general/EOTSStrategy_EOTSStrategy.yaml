documentation:
  brief: Initializes the EOTSStrategy class for handling end-of-the-season strategies
    in World of Warcraft.
  description: The EOTSStrategy constructor initializes the strategy class used for
    managing end-of-the-season events and behaviors within the TrinityCore framework.
    This class is typically employed by AI systems to handle seasonal transitions,
    reward distributions, and event-based logic that occurs at the conclusion of game
    seasons. The initialization process sets up internal state variables, registers
    necessary callbacks, and prepares the object for use in game event handling. It
    ensures that all required resources are allocated and configured properly before
    the strategy can be applied to NPCs or players during seasonal events.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'EOTSStrategy strategy;

      // The constructor automatically initializes all internal components

      // ready for use in seasonal event handling'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method and should be called only during object instantiation.
    The class likely integrates with TrinityCore's AI subsystem and event management
    system to properly handle seasonal transitions.
