  class: Quest
  method: GetPOIPriority
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetPOIPriority() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the priority level of a quest's POI (Point of Interest) for display
    in the quest log.
  description: The GetPOIPriority method retrieves the priority value associated with
    a quest's Point of Interest, which determines how prominently the quest appears
    in the player's quest log. This value is used by the game engine to prioritize
    quest display order and can affect quest visibility and completion status. The
    method is typically called during quest processing or when updating quest information
    in the player's quest log.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the POI priority level, where higher values
    indicate higher priority. Values of 0 typically indicate no priority or default
    priority, while higher values suggest more important quests that should be displayed
    prominently in the quest log.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 priority = quest->GetPOIPriority();\nif (priority > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Quest has a POI priority\n    // Display in quest log with higher visibility\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest processing system and should not
    be called directly by developers unless specifically required for quest handling.
    The value returned represents the priority level used by the game engine to determine
    quest display order in the quest log.
  warnings: The method may return 0 for quests without POI data, which could indicate
    that no POI information is available or that the quest has no priority assigned.
    Care should be taken when using this value for display purposes as it may not
    always reflect actual quest importance.
