  brief: Updates the cooldown tracking for rogue abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method manages the internal cooldown timers for
    a rogue AI character, ensuring that abilities are properly tracked and made available
    based on their cooldown periods. This method is typically called during each AI
    update cycle to decrement active cooldowns and handle ability readiness. It integrates
    with the core TrinityCore AI framework to maintain accurate state information
    for ability usage.

  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly within the AI update loop.
