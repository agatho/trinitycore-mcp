  signature: std::string MovementPriorityMapper::GetPriorityName(PlayerBotMovementPriority
    priority)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the string name corresponding to a given player bot movement priority
    value.
  description: The GetPriorityName method maps a PlayerBotMovementPriority enumeration
    value to its associated human-readable string representation. This utility function
    is commonly used within the TrinityCore AI system to provide debug output, configuration
    logging, or user interface text for movement priorities assigned to player bots.
    The method performs a lookup operation based on the provided priority enum value
    and returns an appropriate descriptive string. It assumes that the input priority
    value is valid and within the expected range of defined movement priorities.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The PlayerBotMovementPriority enumeration value for which to retrieve
      the corresponding name string. Valid values are typically defined within the
      PlayerBotMovementPriority enum, such as PRIORITY_IDLE, PRIORITY_COMBAT, PRIORITY_FOLLOW,
      etc.
  returns: A std::string containing the descriptive name of the specified movement
    priority. For example, if the input is PRIORITY_COMBAT, the method might return
    "Combat" or "Combat Mode". The exact string format depends on internal mapping
    logic within the MovementPriorityMapper class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerBotMovementPriority priority = PRIORITY_COMBAT;

      std::string name = MovementPriorityMapper::GetPriorityName(priority);

      // Result: name would contain "Combat" or similar descriptive string'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug Logging Example
    code: "void LogCurrentMovementPriority(Player* player)\n{\n    PlayerBotMovementPriority\
      \ current = player->GetBotMovementPriority();\n    std::string priorityName\
      \ = MovementPriorityMapper::GetPriorityName(current);\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\"\
      , \"Current movement priority for {} is: {}\", player->GetName(), priorityName);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal lookup table or switch statement to map
    enum values to strings. It's designed for readability and debugging purposes rather
    than performance-critical operations. The implementation should be thread-safe
    if used in multi-threaded contexts involving bot AI processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the input priority value is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid enumeration values may result in undefined behavior or incorrect string
    returns. This method does not perform bounds checking on the enum value.
