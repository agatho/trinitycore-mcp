  method: RemovePlayerLocalFlag
  signature: void Player::RemovePlayerLocalFlag(PlayerLocalFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified player local flag from the player's local flags.
  description: This method removes a specific PlayerLocalFlags flag from the player's
    internal local flags list. It is used to manage player-specific game state flags
    that affect gameplay mechanics, such as visibility settings, combat states, or
    other player-specific attributes. The method operates on the player's local flag
    structure and ensures proper flag removal without affecting global game state.
    This function is typically used during player initialization, character creation,
    or when changing player state during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The PlayerLocalFlags enum value that specifies which flag to remove
      from the player's local flags. Valid values include various combinations of
      flags such as FLAG_1, FLAG_2, etc., depending on the specific implementation
      and game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->RemovePlayerLocalFlag(PLAYER_LOCAL_FLAG_1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with flag checking
    code: "Player* player = new Player();\nif (player->HasPlayerLocalFlag(PLAYER_LOCAL_FLAG_1))\
      \ {\n    player->RemovePlayerLocalFlag(PLAYER_LOCAL_FLAG_1);\n}\n// Additional\
      \ logic for handling flag removal"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method typically operates on a bitmask-based
    system where flags are stored as bit positions. The method should be called carefully
    to avoid removing flags that may affect gameplay mechanics or player state. Performance
    considerations: This method is lightweight and does not involve complex operations,
    but it''s important to ensure proper flag management during player state changes.'
  warnings: This method should only be used when the player's local flags are properly
    initialized and managed. Removing flags without proper context can lead to unexpected
    behavior in game mechanics or player state. Avoid calling this method during critical
    gameplay moments where flags are actively being used for game logic.
