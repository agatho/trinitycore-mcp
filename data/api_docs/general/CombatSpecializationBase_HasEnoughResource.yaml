documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has sufficient resource requirements to cast a spell
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates whether the current player character
    possesses adequate resources (such as mana, rage, energy, or focus) required to
    successfully cast a specified spell. This method is typically used during spell
    casting validation to prevent invalid spell attempts. It considers the player's
    current resource levels against the spell's resource cost and returns true if
    sufficient resources are available, false otherwise. The method integrates with
    TrinityCore's combat system and spell resource management mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has enough resources to cast the specified spell,
    false if insufficient resources are available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->HasEnoughResource(12345)) {\n  \
      \  // Proceed with spell casting\n    player->CastSpell(target, 12345, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Notify player of insufficient resources\n    player->SendSpellFailed(12345,\
      \ SPELL_FAILED_NO_POWER);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs resource validation based on the current spell's power
    cost and the player's active resource type. It does not modify any player state
    or resources directly, but rather serves as a validation check for spell casting
    logic.
