documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GameObjectModelOwnerBase instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GameObjectModelOwnerBase class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were managed
    by this object. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation,
    this typically involves releasing references to game object models, ensuring proper
    cleanup of model data structures, and preventing memory leaks when instances of
    GameObjectModelOwnerBase are removed from memory. This method is automatically
    invoked during object destruction and should not be called manually.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destructor Call
    code: 'GameObjectModelOwnerBase* modelOwner = new GameObjectModelOwnerBase();

      // ... use the object ...

      delete modelOwner; // Destructor is automatically called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is part of the base class and may be overridden in derived
    classes. It's important to ensure that any derived destructors properly call the
    base class destructor to maintain proper cleanup order.
