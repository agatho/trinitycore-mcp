  signature: void ThreatManager::ResetAllThreat()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all threat entries from the ThreatManager's threat list.
  description: The ResetAllThreat method removes all current threat values associated
    with creatures or NPCs in the ThreatManager. This function is typically invoked
    during specific game events such as when a creature is reset, respawns, or when
    threat needs to be cleared for tactical reasons. It ensures that no residual threat
    data persists between combat phases or after certain state changes. The method
    does not affect the underlying creature's AI behavior directly but resets its
    internal threat tracking mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature AI
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnCombatEnd()\n{\n    m_threatManager->ResetAllThreat();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with creature reset logic or
    when transitioning between different combat states. It should be called carefully
    to avoid unintended side effects on active threat calculations.
  warnings: Calling ResetAllThreat during active combat may cause unexpected behavior
    if other systems depend on existing threat values. Ensure that this function is
    only invoked at appropriate transition points in the creature's lifecycle.
