documentation:
  brief: Removes an item from a guild's bank tab at the specified slot.
  description: The _RemoveItem method is an internal function used by the Guild class
    to remove an item from a specific tab and slot within the guild's bank. This method
    typically handles the removal of items during operations such as item transfers,
    deletions, or when items are moved between tabs. It operates on the internal data
    structures representing the guild's bank inventory and updates the transaction
    state accordingly. The method is not intended for direct external use but is part
    of the internal guild management system.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier used to track the operation in the guild's
      transaction log. This value helps ensure consistency when multiple operations
      are performed on the guild bank.
  - name: tabId
    description: The index of the tab within the guild bank from which the item is
      to be removed. Tabs are zero-indexed and correspond to different categories
      or sections of the guild's stored items.
  - name: slotId
    description: The slot index within the specified tab where the item resides. Slots
      are also zero-indexed, representing individual storage positions within a tab.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove an item from guild bank tab 0, slot 5
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      guild->_RemoveItem(12345, 0, 5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly by external
    code. It is part of the TrinityCore's guild bank management system and relies
    on proper transaction handling to maintain data integrity.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper transaction context or invalid tab/slot
    indices may lead to undefined behavior or corruption of the guild's bank data
    structure.
