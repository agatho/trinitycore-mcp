  method: Update
  signature: void ShadowDanceTracker::Update()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the shadow dance tracker state based on current game conditions and
    player actions.
  description: The Update method in ShadowDanceTracker is responsible for maintaining
    the internal state of the shadow dance ability tracking system. This method typically
    checks the current status of the shadow dance buff, evaluates whether it should
    be active or expired, and updates relevant game objects such as player auras,
    cooldowns, and combat logs. It is called periodically during the game loop to
    ensure accurate tracking of the shadow dance effect's duration, stack count, and
    any associated mechanics like energy regeneration or damage multipliers. The method
    may also handle interactions with other abilities that could affect shadow dance,
    such as dispels or overlapping effects from different sources.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'ShadowDanceTracker tracker;

      tracker.Update(); // Updates the internal state of the shadow dance tracker'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the game's main update loop or triggered
    by specific events related to shadow dance usage. It should not be called manually
    unless implementing custom behavior or debugging. The implementation may involve
    checking for player state changes, aura expiration, and updating UI elements that
    display shadow dance information.
