  brief: Stops all active bot profiling sessions in the TrinityCore instance
  description: The StopAllSessions method terminates all currently running bot profiler
    sessions within the TrinityCore framework. This function is typically used to
    cleanly shutdown or reset profiling activities across all active bot instances.
    The method ensures that any ongoing performance measurements are properly concluded
    and resources associated with profiling are released. It does not take any parameters
    and performs no return value operations, making it a simple control mechanism
    for managing bot profiling lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotProfiler::StopAllSessions();

  notes: This method should be called when bot profiling is no longer needed to prevent
    resource leaks. It's recommended to call this before shutting down the server
    or changing profiling configurations.
