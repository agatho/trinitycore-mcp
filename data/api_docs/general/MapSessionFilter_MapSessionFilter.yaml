  class: MapSessionFilter
  method: MapSessionFilter
  signature: void MapSessionFilter::MapSessionFilter(WorldSession * pSession)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a MapSessionFilter with the provided WorldSession pointer.
  description: The MapSessionFilter constructor initializes the filter object with
    a specific WorldSession instance. This filter is typically used to manage and
    route packets or events within a specific map context associated with the given
    session. The constructor sets up internal state to associate the filter with the
    provided session, allowing for proper handling of session-specific data and map-related
    operations in the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: pSession
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object that this filter will be associated
      with. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of MapSessionFilter
    code: 'WorldSession* session = ...; // Assume valid session

      MapSessionFilter filter(session);

      // The filter is now initialized with the given session'
    language: cpp
  notes: The MapSessionFilter class is typically used in conjunction with map management
    systems to ensure that session-specific data is properly handled within a particular
    game map context. This constructor does not perform any complex operations but
    rather stores the session pointer for later use.
