documentation:
  brief: Destroys the performance monitor instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the IBotPerformanceMonitor interface is responsible
    for cleaning up any resources allocated during the lifetime of the performance
    monitoring object. This method ensures proper deallocation of memory and cleanup
    of internal data structures used for tracking bot performance metrics. The destructor
    is automatically invoked when an instance of a class implementing this interface
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important that this method be
    called to prevent memory leaks within the TrinityCore framework, especially in
    long-running applications such as AI bot systems where performance monitoring
    is continuously active.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of performance monitor
    code: 'IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = new BotPerformanceMonitor();

      // ... use the monitor ...

      delete monitor; // Triggers ~IBotPerformanceMonitor()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should not be called directly unless you are managing the
    object's lifetime manually. In most cases, it will be invoked automatically by
    the C++ runtime when the object goes out of scope or is deleted. The implementation
    must ensure thread-safe cleanup if the monitor is accessed from multiple threads.
