documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the difficulty multiplier based on player skill level
  description: The GetDifficulty method computes a difficulty scaling factor that
    adjusts game challenge levels according to the player's skill. This curve-based
    calculation is used to dynamically modify enemy strength, loot quality, and other
    gameplay elements to match the player's progression. The method takes into account
    the player's current skill level and maps it against an internal difficulty curve
    to determine the appropriate multiplier. This ensures that content remains appropriately
    challenging as players advance through the game.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the difficulty multiplier. Values typically
    range from 0.5 to 2.0, where 1.0 represents normal difficulty, values less than
    1.0 indicate easier content, and values greater than 1.0 indicate harder content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Difficulty Calculation
    code: 'float playerSkill = 80.0f;

      float difficulty = difficultyCurve.GetDifficulty(playerSkill);

      // Returns a difficulty multiplier based on the player''s skill level

      printf("Difficulty: %.2f\n", difficulty);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Difficulty in Game Logic
    code: "void ApplyDifficultyToEnemy(Unit* enemy, float playerSkill) {\n    float\
      \ difficulty = difficultyCurve.GetDifficulty(playerSkill);\n    enemy->SetHealth(enemy->GetMaxHealth()\
      \ * difficulty);\n    enemy->SetDamage(enemy->GetBaseDamage() * difficulty);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to be called frequently during gameplay, so performance
    optimization is important. The internal curve implementation likely uses precomputed
    lookup tables or mathematical functions for efficiency. This method should only
    be called with valid player skill values within expected ranges.
  warnings: This method may return unexpected results if called with invalid player
    skill values outside the supported range. Ensure that playerSkill parameter is
    validated before calling to prevent undefined behavior or incorrect difficulty
    calculations.
