  class: AttackAction
  method: GetRange
  signature: float AttackAction::GetRange() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the maximum attack range of the current attack action.
  description: The GetRange method retrieves the effective range at which the AttackAction
    can successfully target enemies. This value is typically derived from the attacker's
    weapon range, spell range, or other combat-related properties depending on the
    specific type of attack being performed. The returned float value represents the
    distance in yards. This method is commonly used by AI systems to determine whether
    a target is within valid attacking distance before initiating an attack. It ensures
    that combat actions are only executed when the attacker has sufficient range to
    reach their intended target.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum attack range in yards. This value
    indicates how far away an enemy can be and still be a valid target for this attack
    action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (unit->GetDistanceTo(target) <= attackAction->GetRange()) {\n    //\
      \ Execute attack\n    unit->Attack(target, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Range Validation for Spell Casting
    code: "float range = attackAction->GetRange();\nif (target && target->IsWithinDist(unit,\
      \ range)) {\n    // Cast spell within range\n    unit->CastSpell(target, spellId,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with distance checks to ensure
    combat actions are only performed when targets are within valid range. The returned
    value may vary depending on the specific attack type (melee vs ranged) and any
    modifiers that affect attack range.
