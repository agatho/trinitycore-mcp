  class: LootItemStorage
  method: AddNewStoredLoot
  signature: void LootItemStorage::AddNewStoredLoot(uint64 containerId, Loot * loot,
    Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Stores a new loot item in the loot storage system for a specified player
    and container.
  description: The AddNewStoredLoot method is responsible for adding a new loot item
    to the internal storage mechanism of the LootItemStorage class. It associates
    the loot with a specific container ID and player, allowing the system to track
    and manage loot distribution. This method is typically invoked when a player successfully
    loots an item from a container such as a corpse, chest, or quest reward. The stored
    loot can later be retrieved or processed by other systems within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method does not perform any validation on the input parameters
    beyond basic type checking, so it's expected that callers provide valid and non-null
    pointers.
  parameters:
  - name: containerId
    description: A unique identifier (GUID) representing the container from which
      the loot was obtained. This could be a creature GUID, game object GUID, or similar
      identifier.
  - name: loot
    description: Pointer to the Loot object containing the loot data and items to
      be stored. Must not be null.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who obtained the loot. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AddNewStoredLoot
    code: 'LootItemStorage storage;

      Player* player = ...; // Valid player pointer

      Loot* loot = ...; // Valid loot pointer

      uint64 containerId = 12345ULL;

      storage.AddNewStoredLoot(containerId, loot, player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core loot management system in TrinityCore. It
    assumes that the Loot object and Player object are valid and properly initialized.
    The container ID should uniquely identify the source of the loot to ensure proper
    tracking and retrieval.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for 'loot' or 'player' parameters will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all inputs are validated before calling
    this method.
