  method: SummonedCreatureDespawn
  signature: void BossAI::SummonedCreatureDespawn(int * summon)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a summoned creature from the boss's summon list when it despawns.
  description: The SummonedCreatureDespawn method is used in BossAI to handle the
    cleanup of summoned creatures when they are removed from the game world. This
    typically occurs when a summoned creature dies, is dismissed, or otherwise becomes
    inactive. The method ensures that the internal tracking of summoned creatures
    within the boss AI is properly updated by removing the reference to the despawned
    creature. It is commonly called as part of the creature's OnDestroy event or during
    cleanup routines to maintain accurate state management for summoned minions.
  parameters:
  - name: summon
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the summon ID or index in the
      boss's summoned creature list. This value should correspond to a valid summoned
      creature tracked by the BossAI instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature Despawn Handler
    code: "void BossAI::OnCreatureDespawn(Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature->GetEntry()\
      \ == SUMMON_ENTRY)\n    {\n        SummonedCreatureDespawn(&summonId);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Multiple Summons
    code: "void BossAI::HandleSummonDeath(uint32 summonEntry)\n{\n    for (int i =\
      \ 0; i < MAX_SUMMONS; ++i)\n    {\n        if (summoned[i] && summoned[i]->GetEntry()\
      \ == summonEntry)\n        {\n            SummonedCreatureDespawn(&i);\n   \
      \         break;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system when a summoned
    creature's lifecycle ends. Developers should ensure that the summon parameter
    correctly references an active entry in the boss's summoned list to avoid invalid
    memory access or incorrect state tracking.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer for 'summon' may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the summon ID corresponds to
    a valid, currently summoned creature before calling this method.
