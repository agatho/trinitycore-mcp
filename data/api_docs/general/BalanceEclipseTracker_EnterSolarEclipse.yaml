documentation:
  brief: Transitions the Balance Eclipse state to Solar Eclipse mode.
  description: The EnterSolarEclipse method is responsible for initiating the transition
    into Solar Eclipse state within the Balance class's eclipse tracking system. This
    method typically modifies internal state variables to reflect that the caster
    is now in a solar eclipse phase, which affects spell casting behavior and resource
    management. The method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return
    operations, serving instead as a state management function for the eclipse system.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BalanceEclipseTracker tracker;

      tracker.EnterSolarEclipse();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the game engine when a player
    enters solar eclipse state, possibly triggered by specific spell effects or aura
    applications. It may also update UI elements or send packets to clients to reflect
    the change in eclipse state.
