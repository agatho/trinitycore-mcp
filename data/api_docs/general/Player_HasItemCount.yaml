  class: Player
  method: HasItemCount
  signature: bool Player::HasItemCount(uint32 item, uint32 count, bool inBankAlso)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has a specific item with given count in their inventory
    or bank.
  description: The HasItemCount method determines whether a player possesses a specified
    item in the required quantity, including items in their bank. This method is commonly
    used in quest scripts and game mechanics to verify item possession before allowing
    actions such as quest completion or item consumption. It checks both inventory
    and bank slots for the presence of the item, making it useful for validating player
    resources during gameplay. The method returns true if the item count matches the
    specified amount, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: The item ID to check for in the player's inventory or bank. This
      must be a valid item entry from the game database.
  - name: count
    description: The number of items to check for. This represents the minimum required
      count of the specified item that must be present.
  - name: inBankAlso
    description: When true, includes bank slots in the search; when false, only checks
      inventory slots. This parameter allows for flexible checking of item locations.
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least the specified count of the given
    item in their inventory or bank, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->HasItemCount(12345, 10, true))\n{\n    // Player has at least\
      \ 10 of item 12345 in inventory or bank\n    // Proceed with quest completion\
      \ or item consumption\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (player->HasItemCount(23456, 1, false))\n{\n    // Player has at least\
      \ 1 of item 23456 only in inventory\n    // Check for quest completion or item\
      \ consumption\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and performs efficiently by checking the player's
    inventory directly without requiring database queries. It uses internal item tracking
    mechanisms to determine item presence.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with items that have stackable counts,
    as it checks for exact count rather than total quantity. Also note that this method
    does not account for item cooldowns or restrictions.
