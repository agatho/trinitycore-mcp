documentation:
  brief: Adds a new criteria data entry to the dataset
  description: The CriteriaDataSet::Add method inserts a new CriteriaData object into
    the internal collection of criteria data. This method is typically used during
    quest initialization or reward processing to register criteria that must be met
    for quest completion or achievement unlocking. The added criteria data is stored
    within the dataset and can later be evaluated against player progress or game
    events. This operation modifies the internal state of the CriteriaDataSet object
    by appending the provided criteria data to its collection.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: The CriteriaData object containing the criteria definition to be
      added to the dataset. This parameter must be a valid CriteriaData instance with
      properly initialized fields representing the conditions that need to be tracked
      or evaluated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Basic Criteria Data Entry
    code: 'CriteriaData criteria;

      criteria.id = 12345;

      criteria.type = 0;

      criteria.value1 = 10;

      // ... initialize other fields

      CriteriaDataSet dataSet;

      dataSet.Add(criteria);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Criteria Entries in Loop
    code: "std::vector<CriteriaData> criteriaList;\n// Populate criteriaList with\
      \ various criteria data\nCriteriaDataSet dataSet;\nfor (const auto& criteria\
      \ : criteriaList)\n{\n    dataSet.Add(criteria);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a shallow copy of the CriteriaData object. Modifications
    to the original CriteriaData after calling Add may affect the stored data if it's
    not properly managed. The method does not validate whether the criteria ID already
    exists in the dataset, so duplicate entries may be added unless handled externally.
  warnings: Ensure that the CriteriaData parameter is fully initialized before passing
    it to this method. Adding invalid or partially initialized criteria data can lead
    to unexpected behavior during quest evaluation or achievement processing. This
    method does not perform any automatic deduplication of criteria entries.
