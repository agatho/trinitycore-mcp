documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific object is currently being replaced for the
    specified seer in smooth phasing mechanics.
  description: This method checks if an object is in the process of being replaced
    or phased out for a particular observer (seer) within the smooth phasing system.
    Smooth phasing is a TrinityCore feature that manages seamless transitions between
    different phases of visibility or interaction for players and objects in the game
    world. The method returns true when the specified seer is currently undergoing
    a phase transition involving the object, indicating that the object's presence
    or state may be temporarily altered or hidden for that observer. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining visual consistency during dynamic phase changes such
    as area transitions, quest events, or environmental modifications.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: The ObjectGuid of the observer (typically a player) for whom the
      phasing status is being checked. This represents the entity whose view of the
      object is being evaluated for replacement.
  returns: Returns true if the object is currently being replaced or phased out for
    the specified seer, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the
    object's visibility or state is undergoing a transition from the seer's perspective.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an object is being replaced for a player
    code: "ObjectGuid playerGuid = player->GetGUID();\nif (smoothPhasing->IsBeingReplacedForSeer(playerGuid))\
      \ {\n    // Handle the case where the object is transitioning for this player\n\
      \    // This might involve delaying certain actions or animations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in conditional logic for phase transitions
    code: "if (!smoothPhasing->IsBeingReplacedForSeer(seerGuid)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with normal object interaction\n    // Object is fully visible and accessible\
      \ to the seer\n    DoNormalInteraction();\n} else {\n    // Object is in transition\
      \ state\n    // Delay or cancel interaction until transition completes\n   \
      \ ScheduleDelayedAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the smooth phasing system to
    manage object visibility states. It's important to note that this check should
    be performed frequently during phase transitions to ensure proper synchronization
    of object states with player perspectives. The implementation likely involves
    checking internal state flags or tracking data structures that maintain which
    objects are in transition for specific observers.
  warnings: This method should not be called outside of the smooth phasing system's
    context, as it relies on internal tracking mechanisms. Incorrect usage may lead
    to inconsistent phase states or visual artifacts. Additionally, calling this method
    during critical rendering or update cycles might introduce performance bottlenecks
    if the underlying tracking structures are not optimized.
