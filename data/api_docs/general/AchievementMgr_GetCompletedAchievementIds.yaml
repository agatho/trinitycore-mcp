documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of completed achievements for the player
  description: The GetCompletedAchievementIds method returns the total number of achievements
    that have been completed by the player. This method is typically used to determine
    how many achievements a player has earned, which can be useful for various game
    mechanics such as progress tracking, reward distribution, or UI display purposes.
    The method does not return the actual IDs of the achievements, but rather the
    count of completed ones. It's important to note that this method only considers
    achievements that have been fully earned and are visible in the player's achievement
    list.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total count of completed achievements
    for the player. Returns 0 if no achievements have been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int completedCount = player->GetAchievementMgr()->GetCompletedAchievementIds();\n\
      if (completedCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Player has completed \" << completedCount\
      \ << \" achievements.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query to count the completed achievements,
    so it may have performance implications if called frequently. The result is cached
    internally by the AchievementMgr class, but may be recalculated if achievement
    data changes.
