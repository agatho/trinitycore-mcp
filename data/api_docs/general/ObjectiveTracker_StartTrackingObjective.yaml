  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::StartTrackingObjective(Player * bot, const QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Begins tracking a specified quest objective for the given player character.
  description: The StartTrackingObjective method initiates the tracking of a specific
    quest objective within the ObjectiveTracker system. This functionality is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment to manage how players view
    and progress through quest objectives. The method takes a Player object and a
    QuestObjectiveData structure, which contains information about the objective to
    be tracked. It integrates with the player's objective tracking UI and updates
    internal state to reflect that the objective is now being monitored. This method
    does not validate whether the objective belongs to the player's current quests
    or if it is already being tracked; such checks are usually performed before calling
    this method.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object for whom the quest objective should
      be tracked. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid player
      instance in the game world.
  - name: objective
    description: A constant reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure that defines
      the details of the quest objective to begin tracking. This includes information
      such as objective type, progress status, and associated quest data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player instance

      QuestObjectiveData objData;

      objData.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_KILL;

      objData.targetEntry = 12345;

      objData.requiredCount = 10;

      objData.currentCount = 0;

      objectiveTracker->StartTrackingObjective(player, objData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal ObjectiveTracker system and is likely
    invoked by quest handling or UI update logic. It assumes that the provided Player
    object and QuestObjectiveData are valid and properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null, as passing an invalid
    pointer may lead to undefined behavior. Also, verify that the objective data is
    consistent with the player's current quest state to avoid UI inconsistencies.
