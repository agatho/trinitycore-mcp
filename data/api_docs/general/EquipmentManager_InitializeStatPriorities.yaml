documentation:
  brief: Initializes the stat priority system for equipment management.
  description: The InitializeStatPriorities method sets up the internal stat priority
    configuration used by the EquipmentManager to determine optimal stat allocations
    for player equipment. This method typically initializes default stat weights or
    loads saved priorities from configuration files. It prepares the manager to make
    informed decisions about equipment upgrades, stat distribution, and gear optimization
    based on predefined priority rules. The initialization process may involve loading
    default values, applying class-specific configurations, or reading from saved
    player preferences.

    initialization. The stat priorities may vary based on player class, specialization,
    and server configuration settings.
