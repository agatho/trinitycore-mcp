documentation:
  brief: Builds entity fragments for values update with mask for a player
  description: This method constructs entity fragments that contain the updated values
    for a specific player, using a bitmask to determine which fields should be included
    in the update. It's primarily used during player updates to ensure proper synchronization
    of object data between server and client. The method handles the construction
    of data fragments for object fields that have changed since the last update.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      ByteBuffer data;

      obj->BuildEntityFragmentsForValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask(&data, 0x01);

      // data now contains the entity fragments for player update'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object updates to ensure proper synchronization
    of values between server and client. It's part of the larger update system that
    handles how object data is transmitted to players.
  warnings: The method assumes that the ByteBuffer parameter is properly initialized
    before calling. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior or memory corruption.
