    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the item amount ratio configuration value for the specified auction
    house type.
  description: This method returns a uint32 value representing the configured item
    amount ratio for a given auction house type. The ratio is typically used by the
    Auction Bot system to determine how many items of a particular type should be
    listed in an auction house. This configuration helps control the quantity of items
    that are automatically posted for sale, balancing market saturation and player
    engagement. The method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call
    from multiple threads. It assumes valid auction house types are passed, though
    invalid inputs may result in undefined behavior or default values.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the item amount ratio for the specified auction
    house type. This value typically defines how many items of a certain type should
    be listed in an auction house at any given time, with higher ratios allowing more
    items to be posted.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve item amount ratio for AH type
    code: uint32 ratio = auctionBotConfig->GetConfigItemAmountRatio(AUCTION_HOUSE_NORMAL);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AuctionBot configuration system and relies on
    internal configuration values that may be loaded from database or config files
    at startup. The returned value should not be modified directly, as it's intended
    to be read-only.
