    && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the resources and state from one PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface object
    to another.
  description: The move assignment operator for PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface transfers
    all resources and internal state from the source object to the current object.
    This operation is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate
    PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface objects are being replaced with more permanent ones.
    The method ensures that the moved-from object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state, suitable for subsequent destruction or assignment. In the context of TrinityCore's
    playerbot system, this operator allows efficient resource management when handling
    database interfaces for bot characters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface object after the
    move operation has completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface db1;

      PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface db2 = std::move(db1); // Uses move assignment

      // db1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Move Assignment
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface db1, db2, db3;

      // ... perform operations on db1 and db2 ...

      db3 = std::move(db1); // Move db1''s resources to db3

      // db1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // db2 remains unchanged'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically used internally by the standard library containers
    when resizing or reorganizing elements. It's important to understand that after
    a move operation, the source object should not be used in any way that might access
    its former data members unless explicitly documented otherwise. The implementation
    likely involves transferring pointers, handles, or other resource identifiers
    rather than copying large amounts of data.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the moved-from object must not be accessed
    in a way that depends on its previous state. If the moved-from object is used
    afterward without reinitialization, it may lead to undefined behavior. This is
    especially important when the object holds database connections or handles that
    become invalid after move.
