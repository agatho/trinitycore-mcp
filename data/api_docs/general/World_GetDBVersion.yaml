  class: World
  method: GetDBVersion
  signature: const char * World::GetDBVersion() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the version string of the database used by the World instance.
  description: The GetDBVersion method returns a constant character pointer to the
    version string of the database that the World object is connected to. This version
    string typically represents the schema or build version of the TrinityCore database
    tables. The returned value is intended for informational purposes and may be used
    for logging, debugging, or compatibility checks. It's important to note that this
    method does not perform any database queries itself; it returns a cached or pre-fetched
    version string that was likely set during server initialization or connection
    setup.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant character pointer (const char*) pointing to the null-terminated
    version string of the connected database. The returned string should not be modified
    or freed by the caller as it is managed internally by the World instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'World* world = World::instance();

      const char* dbVersion = world->GetDBVersion();

      printf("Database version: %s\n", dbVersion);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Database Version on Startup
    code: "void InitializeWorld()\n{\n    World* world = World::instance();\n    const\
      \ char* version = world->GetDBVersion();\n    sLog->outString(\"Connected to\
      \ database version: %s\", version);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe as it returns a cached value that is initialized
    once during server startup. The version string returned should not be assumed
    to change during runtime unless the database connection is re-established.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or free the returned character pointer, as it
    points to internal memory managed by the World instance. Accessing the returned
    pointer after the World instance has been destroyed results in undefined behavior.
