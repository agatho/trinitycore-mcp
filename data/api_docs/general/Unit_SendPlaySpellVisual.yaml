documentation:
  brief: Sends a spell visual effect to a target position with specified parameters
  description: This method sends a spell visual effect to a specific target position,
    allowing for precise control over how the spell visual appears in the game world.
    It supports various parameters including spell visual ID, miss reason, reflect
    status, travel speed, and launch delay. The method is used primarily for displaying
    spell effects in a controlled manner, particularly when dealing with targeted
    spells or effects that need to be shown at specific positions relative to the
    caster.
  parameters:
  - name: targetPosition
    description: The target position where the spell visual effect should appear.
      This is typically a reference to a position in the world where the spell will
      be displayed.
  - name: spellVisualId
    description: The ID of the spell visual effect to send. This corresponds to specific
      spell visual IDs in the game database that define how the spell appears.
  - name: missReason
    description: The reason for a miss, if applicable. This parameter defines whether
      the spell was missed due to various conditions like immunity or resistance.
  - name: reflectStatus
    description: The reflect status of the spell. This indicates whether the spell
      was reflected by another entity and how it should be handled.
  - name: travelSpeed
    description: The speed at which the spell visual travels to its target position.
      This controls how fast the visual effect moves toward the target.
  - name: speedAsTime
    description: If true, the travelSpeed parameter is interpreted as time rather
      than speed. This allows for more precise control over timing of visual effects.
  - name: launchDelay
    description: The delay before the spell visual effect begins to travel toward
      its target position. This controls when the visual effect starts moving.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SendPlaySpellVisual(targetPosition, spellVisualId, missReason, reflectStatus,
      travelSpeed, true, launchDelay);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SendPlaySpellVisual(targetPosition, 12345, 0, 1, 2.0f, false, 0.5f);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with spell casting mechanics
    and may require proper positioning of the target to ensure correct visual display.
    Performance considerations include ensuring that the spell visual ID corresponds
    to valid entries in the game database.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as incorrect parameters can
    lead to visual artifacts or misaligned spell effects. The method should not be
    used with invalid spell visual IDs as it may cause crashes or undefined behavior.
