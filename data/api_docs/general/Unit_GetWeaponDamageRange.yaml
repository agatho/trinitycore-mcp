  method: GetWeaponDamageRange
  signature: float Unit::GetWeaponDamageRange(int attType, WeaponDamageRange type)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum damage value of a weapon based on attack type and weapon
    damage range type.
  description: The GetWeaponDamageRange method retrieves the minimum damage value
    for a specified weapon damage range type and attack type. This method is commonly
    used in combat calculations to determine base damage values for different weapon
    types, such as melee weapons or ranged weapons. It considers the weapon's damage
    range and the attack type (melee, ranged, or spell) to return appropriate damage
    values. The method is essential for calculating damage output during combat, particularly
    when dealing with weapon-based attacks.
  parameters:
  - name: attType
    description: The attack type (melee, ranged, or spell) used to determine which
      weapon damage range to consider.
  - name: type
    description: The weapon damage range type (normal, off-hand, or two-handed) that
      specifies which damage value to retrieve.
  returns: Returns the minimum damage value for the specified weapon damage range
    and attack type. The return value represents the base damage of a weapon based
    on its damage range and attack type, typically used in combat calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float minDamage = unit->GetWeaponDamageRange(ATT_TYPE_MELEE, WEAPON_DAMAGE_RANGE_NORMAL);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: float minDamage = unit->GetWeaponDamageRange(ATT_TYPE_RANGED, WEapon_DAMAGE_RANGE_OFFHAND);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and is typically used in combat calculations.
    It requires knowledge of weapon damage ranges and attack types to function properly.
    The method may return zero if no weapon is equipped or if the specified attack
    type does not match the weapon's damage range.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a unit has a weapon equipped; otherwise,
    it will return zero values. Be cautious when using this method in combat calculations
    as it may affect damage output if used incorrectly.
