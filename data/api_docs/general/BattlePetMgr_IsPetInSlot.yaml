  method: IsPetInSlot
  signature: bool BattlePetMgr::IsPetInSlot(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a battle pet is present in the specified slot.
  description: The IsPetInSlot method determines if a battle pet exists in a given
    slot within the player's battle pet collection. This method is typically used
    to validate the presence of a pet before performing operations such as retrieving
    pet data, swapping pets, or managing the battle pet team. The method accepts a
    GUID parameter that identifies the specific slot to check. It returns true if
    a pet is present in that slot, and false otherwise. This functionality is integral
    to the battle pet system in World of Warcraft, particularly for managing pet teams
    and ensuring valid pet references during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet slot to check. This
      value typically corresponds to a specific index or identifier within the player's
      battle pet collection.
  returns: Returns true if a battle pet is present in the specified slot, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Pet Exists in a Slot
    code: "if (battlePetMgr->IsPetInSlot(12345)) {\n    // A pet exists in slot 12345\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Pet found in slot.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // No\
      \ pet in slot 12345\n    std::cout << \"No pet in slot.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BattlePetMgr class which manages battle pets for
    players. The GUID parameter should correspond to a valid battle pet slot identifier
    within the player's collection. Performance-wise, this method performs a simple
    lookup operation and should be efficient.
