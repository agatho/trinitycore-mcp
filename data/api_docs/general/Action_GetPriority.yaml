  method: GetPriority
  signature: uint32 Action::GetPriority() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the execution priority value of the action.
  description: The GetPriority method returns the numerical priority level assigned
    to this action within the AI system. This priority determines the order in which
    actions are considered for execution by the AI decision-making process. Higher
    priority actions are typically evaluated before lower priority ones, though the
    exact behavior may depend on the specific AI implementation and context. The returned
    value is used internally by the TrinityCore AI framework to manage action scheduling
    and selection.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the action's priority level. Higher values
    indicate higher priority, with 0 typically being the lowest priority. The specific
    range and meaning of priority values may vary depending on how the action was
    initialized or configured within the AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 priority = myAction->GetPriority();\nif (priority > 100)\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle high-priority action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Priorities
    code: "Action* action1 = ...;\nAction* action2 = ...;\n\nif (action1->GetPriority()\
      \ > action2->GetPriority())\n{\n    // action1 has higher priority\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The priority value is typically set during action initialization or configuration
    and may be modified through other methods in the Action class. This method is
    thread-safe as it only reads a stored value without modifying any internal state.
