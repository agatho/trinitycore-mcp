  method: LfgQueueStatusData
  signature: void LfgQueueStatusData::LfgQueueStatusData(uint8 _queueId, uint32 _dungeonId,
    int32 _waitTime, int32 _waitTimeAvg, int32 _waitTimeTank, int32 _waitTimeHealer,
    int32 _waitTimeDps, uint32 _queuedTime, uint8 _tanks, uint8 _healers, uint8 _dps)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new LfgQueueStatusData object with specified queue and dungeon
    information.
  description: The LfgQueueStatusData constructor initializes a data structure that
    holds information about a player's status in a Looking for Group (LFG) queue.
    This includes details such as wait times, queued time, and the number of players
    currently queued for specific roles (tank, healer, DPS). The data is used by the
    TrinityCore server to communicate LFG queue status to clients, enabling players
    to see how long they've been waiting and how many others are in their queue. This
    constructor is typically invoked when creating or updating LFG queue status information
    within the game's LFG system.
  parameters:
  - name: _queueId
    description: Unique identifier for the LFG queue. Used to distinguish between
      different types of queues (e.g., normal, heroic, mythic). Valid values are typically
      0-255 representing different queue types.
  - name: _dungeonId
    description: Identifier for the specific dungeon or instance being queued for.
      This value corresponds to the dungeon entry in the game's database and determines
      which content players will be matched into.
  - name: _waitTime
    description: Current estimated wait time for the queue in seconds. Negative values
      may indicate an error or special case, while positive values represent actual
      wait duration.
  - name: _waitTimeAvg
    description: Average wait time across all players in this queue type, in seconds.
      Used for statistical purposes and queue management to balance load.
  - name: _waitTimeTank
    description: Estimated wait time specifically for tank role players in this queue,
      in seconds. Helps prioritize role-specific matching.
  - name: _waitTimeHealer
    description: Estimated wait time specifically for healer role players in this
      queue, in seconds. Helps prioritize role-specific matching.
  - name: _waitTimeDps
    description: Estimated wait time specifically for DPS role players in this queue,
      in seconds. Helps prioritize role-specific matching.
  - name: _queuedTime
    description: Total time the player has been queued for this specific dungeon,
      in seconds. Used to track individual player queue duration.
  - name: _tanks
    description: Number of tank class players currently queued for this dungeon. Valid
      range is 0-255 representing player count.
  - name: _healers
    description: Number of healer class players currently queued for this dungeon.
      Valid range is 0-255 representing player count.
  - name: _dps
    description: Number of DPS class players currently queued for this dungeon. Valid
      range is 0-255 representing player count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize LFG Queue Status Data
    code: LfgQueueStatusData status(0, 1234, 180, 120, 200, 150, 160, 300, 2, 3, 5);
    language: cpp
  - title: Create Queue Status for Specific Dungeon
    code: 'uint8 queueId = LFG_QUEUE_DUNGEON; // Typically defined in LFG constants

      uint32 dungeonId = 1450; // Shadowfang Keep

      int32 waitTime = 90;

      int32 avgWaitTime = 75;

      int32 tankWaitTime = 100;

      int32 healerWaitTime = 80;

      int32 dpsWaitTime = 85;

      uint32 queuedTime = 150;

      uint8 tanks = 1;

      uint8 healers = 2;

      uint8 dps = 4;


      LfgQueueStatusData status(queueId, dungeonId, waitTime, avgWaitTime, tankWaitTime,
      healerWaitTime, dpsWaitTime, queuedTime, tanks, healers, dps);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the LFG system implementation and should be used
    in conjunction with other LFG-related classes. The wait times are typically updated
    dynamically by the server based on current queue conditions and player matching
    algorithms. The class members are designed to be accessed through getter methods
    rather than direct member access for encapsulation purposes.
  warnings: The constructor does not perform any validation on input parameters. It
    is recommended to validate inputs before calling this constructor, especially
    for dungeon IDs which must correspond to valid entries in the game database. Incorrect
    wait time values may cause client-side UI issues or incorrect queue status display.
