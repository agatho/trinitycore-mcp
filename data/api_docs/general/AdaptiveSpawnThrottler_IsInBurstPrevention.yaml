  method: IsInBurstPrevention
  signature: bool AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::IsInBurstPrevention() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the adaptive spawn throttler is currently in a burst prevention
    state.
  description: The IsInBurstPrevention method checks if the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
    is currently preventing excessive spawning due to recent bursts. This mechanism
    helps maintain server performance and stability by limiting rapid spawn events
    that could overwhelm the system. The method returns true when the throttler has
    detected a burst condition and is actively enforcing prevention measures, and
    false otherwise. This functionality is typically used in conjunction with spawn
    point management and dynamic world object creation within TrinityCore's AI and
    spawn systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler is currently in a burst prevention
    state, indicating that spawning has been temporarily restricted due to recent
    excessive activity. Returns false if no burst prevention is currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (adaptiveSpawnThrottler.IsInBurstPrevention())\n{\n    // Handle case\
      \ where spawning is currently throttled\n    sLog->outString(\"Spawn throttling\
      \ active, skipping new spawns.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spawn Logic
    code: "void WorldObject::UpdateSpawns()\n{\n    if (!adaptiveSpawnThrottler.IsInBurstPrevention())\n\
      \    {\n        // Proceed with normal spawn logic\n        SpawnCreatures();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Delay or skip spawning to respect throttling\n\
      \        ScheduleNextSpawnCheck();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's spawn management
    system. The burst prevention state may be triggered automatically based on spawn
    rate thresholds and system load metrics. Developers should not manually manipulate
    the throttler state directly, as this could lead to inconsistent behavior or performance
    issues.
  warnings: Calling this method during high-frequency update loops may introduce performance
    overhead if used excessively. Ensure that burst prevention checks are not performed
    more frequently than necessary for optimal server performance.
