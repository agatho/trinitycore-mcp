  method: NeedsBurst
  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::NeedsBurst() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat state requires immediate burst damage output.
  description: The NeedsBurst method evaluates the current combat state to determine
    if an urgent burst of damage should be executed. This is typically used in AI
    decision-making processes where the system needs to decide between sustained damage
    and high-impact bursts based on enemy health, threat levels, or tactical conditions.
    The method considers factors such as remaining enemy health percentage, available
    mana, and combat duration to make this determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current combat state indicates a need for burst damage
    output, false otherwise. A return value of true typically signals that immediate
    high-damage actions should be prioritized over sustained attacks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (analyzer.NeedsBurst()) {\n    // Execute burst spell or ability\n \
      \   player.CastSpell(burstSpellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "void CombatAI::Update()\n{\n    if (analyzer.NeedsBurst())\n    {\n   \
      \     // Switch to burst mode\n        SetCombatMode(BURST_MODE);\n        CastHighDamageSpell();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Continue with normal rotation\n        SetCombatMode(NORMAL_MODE);\n\
      \        CastRegularSpell();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat update cycles and may involve
    performance considerations when used frequently. The decision logic might be influenced
    by internal state tracking that accumulates over time, making it important to
    understand the context in which this method is invoked.
  warnings: The return value of this method should not be used as the sole determinant
    for spell casting without additional validation, as it's based on a snapshot of
    combat conditions and may change rapidly. Also, ensure that burst abilities are
    properly cooldown-checked before execution.
