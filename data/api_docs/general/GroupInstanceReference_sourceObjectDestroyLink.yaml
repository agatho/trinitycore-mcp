documentation:
  brief: Destroys the link between a group instance reference and its source object
  description: The sourceObjectDestroyLink method is responsible for breaking the
    association between a GroupInstanceReference object and its underlying source
    object. This typically occurs when the source object is being destroyed or removed
    from the game world, ensuring proper cleanup of references to prevent dangling
    pointers or memory leaks. The method likely updates internal tracking structures
    to reflect that the source object is no longer valid. This operation is crucial
    for maintaining the integrity of group instance management within TrinityCore's
    framework.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when destroying a group instance
    code: 'GroupInstanceReference* ref = new GroupInstanceReference();

      // ... some operations ...

      ref->sourceObjectDestroyLink(); // Clean up reference link

      delete ref;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the source object is about to be destroyed
    or is no longer accessible. Calling this method on a valid source object may lead
    to undefined behavior or broken references.
  warnings: Do not call this method unless you are certain that the source object
    will no longer be used. Improper usage can result in memory corruption or access
    violations when other parts of the code attempt to reference the now-invalidated
    source object.
