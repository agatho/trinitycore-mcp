  class: PathGenerator
  method: SetStartPosition
  signature: void PathGenerator::SetStartPosition(const int & point)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the starting position for path generation within the PathGenerator.
  description: The SetStartPosition method configures the initial point from which
    a path will be calculated by the PathGenerator. This method is typically used
    in navigation systems to define where an AI-controlled unit or object should begin
    its movement path. The provided point parameter represents the index of the starting
    position within the pathfinding grid or waypoint system. It's important to note
    that this method does not immediately calculate the path; it only sets the starting
    point for subsequent pathfinding operations. The PathGenerator may require additional
    configuration such as destination points before a complete path can be generated.
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: An integer reference representing the index or identifier of the
      starting position in the pathfinding system. This value should correspond to
      a valid node or waypoint within the navigation mesh.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Start Position for NPC Movement
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.SetStartPosition(5);

      // The path generator will now use point 5 as the starting position

      // for any subsequent pathfinding operations.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Start Position Update
    code: 'uint32 currentPoint = GetNextWaypoint();

      pathGen.SetStartPosition(currentPoint);

      // Updates the start point dynamically based on current position

      // before calculating next segment of path.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger pathfinding system and should be used in
    conjunction with other PathGenerator methods like SetDestination() and GeneratePath().
    The point parameter must reference a valid location within the navigation mesh
    or waypoint system; otherwise, subsequent path calculations may fail or produce
    unexpected results. This method is typically called before initiating any pathfinding
    computation.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the start point to an invalid index can lead to failed
    pathfinding operations or undefined behavior. Ensure that the point value corresponds
    to an actual navigable location in your map's pathfinding grid. Avoid calling
    this method during active path calculation as it may interfere with ongoing computations.
