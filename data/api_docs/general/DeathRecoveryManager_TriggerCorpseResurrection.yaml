  signature: bool DeathRecoveryManager::TriggerCorpseResurrection()
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to resurrect a player from their corpse if conditions are met.
  description: The TriggerCorpseResurrection method in DeathRecoveryManager handles
    the logic for reviving a player character from their death corpse. This method
    typically checks whether resurrection is allowed based on game rules, such as
    time since death, location, and player state. It may also handle the removal of
    death-related debuffs or effects, and can trigger visual or auditory effects associated
    with resurrection. The method returns true if the resurrection was successfully
    initiated, and false otherwise, which could happen due to invalid conditions like
    being in a restricted zone or having already been resurrected.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the corpse resurrection process was successfully triggered
    and initiated; returns false if the conditions for resurrection are not met or
    if an error occurred during the process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resurrection Trigger
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager.TriggerCorpseResurrection()) {\n    // Resurrection\
      \ logic executed successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Player resurrection initiated.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate resurrection\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to resurrect player.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during death recovery mechanics, such as
    when a player attempts to resurrect themselves or when an external system (like
    a spell or quest) triggers resurrection. It should be used carefully in contexts
    where multiple systems might attempt to resurrect the same player.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without verifying that the player is
    actually dead and that resurrection rules are satisfied, as calling it incorrectly
    may lead to unexpected behavior or client desynchronization.
