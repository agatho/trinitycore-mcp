  class: LootDistribution
  method: ProcessLootCouncilDecision
  signature: void LootDistribution::ProcessLootCouncilDecision(Group * group, const
    LootItem & item, Player * recipient)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a loot council decision for a specific item and recipient within
    a group.
  description: The ProcessLootCouncilDecision method handles the logic for distributing
    loot when a loot council decision has been made. It takes a group, a specific
    loot item, and a recipient player as inputs to determine how the item should be
    awarded. This method is typically invoked during World of Warcraft's loot distribution
    system when using the loot council feature, where players vote on who should receive
    an item. The method ensures proper item assignment, updates the loot state, and
    handles any necessary notifications or logging for the distribution event.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that made the
      loot council decision. Must be a valid group with members who participated in
      the council.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being distributed, including item ID, stack size, and other loot properties.
  - name: recipient
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is designated as the recipient of
      the loot item according to the council decision. Must be a valid player in the
      group.
  returns: null

    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      item.itemid = 12345;

      item.count = 1;

      Player* recipient = group->GetMember(0);

      lootDistribution->ProcessLootCouncilDecision(group, item, recipient);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the loot council decision has already been finalized
    and validated. It does not perform any validation of the decision itself but rather
    executes the distribution based on the provided parameters. The method may trigger
    additional events or updates to the group's loot state.
  warnings: Ensure that the recipient player is actually a member of the provided
    group, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Also, make sure the item structure
    contains valid data before calling this method.
