  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: HasFollowTarget
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::HasFollowTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the leader-follow behavior has an active follow target assigned.
  description: The HasFollowTarget method determines if a LeaderFollowBehavior instance
    currently has a valid follow target set. This is typically used in AI systems
    where creatures or NPCs need to track and follow a specific target, such as during
    quest-related events or group movement scenarios. The method returns true if a
    valid target exists and false otherwise. This check is essential before attempting
    to perform actions that depend on having a follow target, ensuring the behavior
    operates correctly within the game's AI framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the LeaderFollowBehavior has an assigned follow target;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior.HasFollowTarget()) {\n    // Proceed with follow-related\
      \ logic\n    leaderFollowBehavior.UpdateFollow();\n} else {\n    // Handle case\
      \ where no target is set\n    leaderFollowBehavior.SetFollowTarget(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple check on internal state variables and should
    have minimal performance impact. It's commonly used in AI update loops to conditionally
    execute follow behavior logic.
