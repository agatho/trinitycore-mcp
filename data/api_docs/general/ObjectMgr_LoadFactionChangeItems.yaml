documentation:
  brief: Loads faction change item data from the database into memory for use in character
    faction switching mechanics.
  description: The LoadFactionChangeItems method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with faction change item configurations retrieved from the database.
    These items are typically required for players to switch between factions (e.g.,
    Horde to Alliance or vice versa) in World of Warcraft. The method is called during
    server startup or reload operations to ensure that all faction change items are
    available for validation when players attempt to perform faction changes. It processes
    records from the 'faction_change_items' database table and stores them in an efficient
    lookup structure for quick access during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadData() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadFactionChangeItems();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload
    processes. It assumes that the database connection is already established and
    that the 'faction_change_items' table exists with proper schema. The loaded data
    is stored in memory for fast lookup, so frequent calls to this method are unnecessary
    and may cause performance overhead.
