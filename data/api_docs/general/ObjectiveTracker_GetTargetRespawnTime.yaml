  method: GetTargetRespawnTime
  signature: uint32 ObjectiveTracker::GetTargetRespawnTime(uint32 targetId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the respawn time of a specified target in seconds.
  description: The GetTargetRespawnTime method retrieves the respawn time for a given
    target identified by its unique ID. This method is commonly used in objective
    tracking systems to determine when a target (such as a quest objective, NPC, or
    game event) will reappear after being destroyed or defeated. The returned value
    represents the number of seconds until the target respawns. If the target does
    not have a defined respawn time or is invalid, the method may return 0 or a default
    value depending on internal implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: targetId
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target whose respawn time is
      to be retrieved. This ID typically corresponds to an NPC, GameObject, or quest
      objective within the game world.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of seconds until the specified
    target respawns. A return value of 0 indicates that the target either does not
    respawn or the respawn time is not defined.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Respawn Time for an NPC
    code: "uint32 respawnTime = objectiveTracker->GetTargetRespawnTime(12345);\nif\
      \ (respawnTime > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"NPC will respawn in %u seconds.\\n\", respawnTime);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"NPC does not respawn or invalid target ID.\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Respawn Time to Update UI
    code: 'uint32 targetId = player->GetQuestObjectiveTargetId(54321);

      uint32 timeLeft = objectiveTracker->GetTargetRespawnTime(targetId);

      player->SendUpdateWorldState(WORLD_STATE_OBJECTIVE_RESPAWN_TIME, timeLeft);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of target respawn times. It is expected
    that the target ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid tracked object
    in the objective tracker system. Performance impact is minimal as it typically
    involves a lookup in an internal map or cache.
  warnings: Ensure that the targetId provided is valid and corresponds to an actual
    tracked target, otherwise the behavior may be undefined or return incorrect values.
    Do not assume that all targets have defined respawn times.
