documentation:
  brief: Updates the Paladin's buffs and auras based on current combat state and spell
    availability.
  description: The UpdatePaladinBuffs method is responsible for managing the casting
    and maintenance of beneficial auras and buffs specific to the Paladin class. This
    includes checking for applicable buffs such as Divine Shield, Blessing of Might,
    and other defensive or offensive enhancements. The method evaluates the current
    state of the Paladin AI, including target status, mana levels, and cooldowns,
    to determine which buffs should be applied or maintained. It ensures that the
    Paladin maintains optimal buff coverage during combat while respecting resource
    constraints and spell cooldowns. This method is typically called during the AI
    update cycle to keep the Paladin's buff state synchronized with game conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void PlayerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_paladinAI)\n        m_paladinAI->UpdatePaladinBuffs();\n    // ...\
      \ rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Paladin AI subsystem and should only be called
    when the AI is actively managing a Paladin character. The implementation relies
    on internal state tracking of buffs, cooldowns, and target conditions. Performance
    impact is minimal as it primarily involves conditional checks and spell casting
    logic.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the AI update cycle without
    proper context checks. Calling it in inappropriate states may lead to invalid
    spell casts or buff management errors.
