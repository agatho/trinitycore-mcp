documentation:
  brief: Clears all entries from the spawn priority queue
  description: The ClearQueue method removes all queued spawn entries from the SpawnPriorityQueue,
    effectively resetting the queue to an empty state. This method is typically used
    during world object cleanup, map loading, or when resetting spawn conditions for
    dynamic entities. The operation is immediate and does not preserve any existing
    spawn data. This method ensures that no stale or outdated spawn requests remain
    in memory, which is crucial for maintaining proper spawn behavior in TrinityCore's
    world management system.

  - title: Clearing a Spawn Priority Queue
    code: 'SpawnPriorityQueue queue;

      // ... populate the queue with spawn entries ...

      queue.ClearQueue(); // Clears all queued spawns'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an immediate clear operation without any delay or async
    processing. It's recommended to call this method before destroying a SpawnPriorityQueue
    instance to prevent memory leaks. The queue will be in a valid empty state after
    calling ClearQueue.
