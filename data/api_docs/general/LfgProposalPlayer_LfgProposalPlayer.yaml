documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new LfgProposalPlayer instance with default values.
  description: The LfgProposalPlayer constructor initializes a new instance of the
    LfgProposalPlayer class. This method sets up the internal state of the object,
    including initializing player-related properties such as GUID, role, and proposal
    status. The constructor is typically called when creating a new player proposal
    within the Looking for Group (LFG) system in TrinityCore. It ensures that all
    member variables are properly initialized to their default states before the object
    is used in LFG operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new LfgProposalPlayer instance
    code: 'LfgProposalPlayer player;

      // The player object is now initialized with default values

      // and can be used in LFG proposal operations.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when a new LfgProposalPlayer object
    is instantiated. It's important to note that this method does not take any parameters,
    so all initialization must occur within the constructor body using default values
    or internal logic.
