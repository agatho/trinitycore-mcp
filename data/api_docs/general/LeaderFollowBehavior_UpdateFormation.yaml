  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: UpdateFormation
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::UpdateFormation(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the formation of a bot AI leader-follow behavior based on current
    game state and positioning.
  description: The UpdateFormation method is responsible for maintaining proper positioning
    and grouping behavior for a bot AI within a leader-follow system. It calculates
    and adjusts the bot's movement to maintain an appropriate distance and formation
    relative to its leader, ensuring coordinated group movement in various combat
    and non-combat scenarios. This method typically handles pathfinding adjustments,
    positioning logic, and dynamic formation changes based on environmental factors
    and threat levels.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that manages the bot's behavior and
      state. This parameter provides access to the AI's current position, target information,
      and leader reference needed for formation calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Update Call
    code: "void MyBotAI::Update()\n{\n    leaderFollowBehavior.UpdateFormation(this);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Formation Update with Conditional Logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateFormationIfNeeded()\n{\n    if (HasLeader() && IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        leaderFollowBehavior.UpdateFormation(this);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may perform
    pathfinding calculations that could impact performance if called too frequently.
    The implementation likely uses distance-based logic to determine when formation
    adjustments are necessary.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI parameter passed to this method is valid and properly
    initialized, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This
    method assumes the AI has a valid leader reference for proper formation calculations.
