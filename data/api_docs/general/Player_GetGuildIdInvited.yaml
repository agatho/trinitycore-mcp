documentation:
  brief: Returns the guild ID that the player was invited to.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier of the guild to which the
    player has been invited. It is commonly used in the context of guild invitations
    and player management within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. The returned
    value represents the ID of the guild that the player is currently invited to,
    which can be used for various operations such as checking if a player is part
    of a specific guild or managing guild-related actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the guild ID that the player was invited
    to. If no invitation exists, this value will be 0.
  examples:
  - title: Check Guild Invitation
    code: "int guildId = player->GetGuildIdInvited();\nif (guildId != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player has a guild invitation\n    // Do something with the guild ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other guild-related functions
    to determine the player's current guild status. It may be called during player
    login or when handling guild invitations.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only returns the ID of the guild the player
    was invited to, not necessarily the guild they are currently a member of. If the
    player has accepted an invitation, this value might change.
