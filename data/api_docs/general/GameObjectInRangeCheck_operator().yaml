documentation:
  brief: Checks if a game object is within range and returns true if it is.
  description: The GameObjectInRangeCheck::operator() method evaluates whether a specified
    game object is within a certain range threshold. This method is typically used
    in TrinityCore's AI and targeting systems to determine if an object (such as a
    GameObject or Unit) is close enough to be considered for interaction, targeting,
    or other gameplay mechanics. The method takes a pointer to an integer representing
    the game object's identifier and returns a boolean indicating whether that object
    meets the range criteria. It is commonly employed in range-based checks during
    AI decision-making processes.
  parameters:
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of
      the game object to check. This parameter should point to a valid GameObject
      GUID or be null.
  returns: Returns true if the specified game object is within range, false otherwise.
    The method may return false if the object pointer is invalid or if the object
    is out of range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "GameObjectInRangeCheck checker;\nint guid = 12345;\nbool result = checker(&guid);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Object is within range\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a loop to check multiple objects
    code: "std::vector<int> objectGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nGameObjectInRangeCheck\
      \ checker;\nfor (int guid : objectGuids) {\n    if (checker(&guid)) {\n    \
      \    // Process the object since it's in range\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a functor class used primarily in TrinityCore's internal
    systems for range checking. It assumes that the game object's position and range
    parameters are properly initialized. The actual range threshold may be determined
    by the implementation context or configuration settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the input pointer to the GUID is valid and not null, as dereferencing
    an invalid pointer will lead to undefined behavior. This method should only be
    used when the game object's position data is available for range calculation.
