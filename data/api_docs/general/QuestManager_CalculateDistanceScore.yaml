  signature: float QuestManager::CalculateDistanceScore(const Quest * quest) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a distance-based score for a quest based on the player's
    current location relative to the quest's objectives.
  description: The CalculateDistanceScore method computes a floating-point value that
    represents how geographically close the player is to completing the given quest.
    This score is typically used in quest prioritization or recommendation systems
    within the game, where quests closer to the player's current position are considered
    more relevant or urgent. The method evaluates the spatial relationship between
    the player's location and the quest's target locations (such as NPCs or object
    spawns) to determine this score. It does not modify any internal state and is
    purely a calculation-based function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated distance score. Higher values
    indicate that the quest is geographically closer to the player, while lower values
    suggest greater distance. The exact scale and interpretation of this score may
    vary depending on implementation details within TrinityCore's quest system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest evaluation
    code: "float score = questManager.CalculateDistanceScore(quest);\nif (score >\
      \ 50.0f) {\n    // Quest is considered nearby\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses Euclidean or Manhattan distance calculations between
    the player's coordinates and the quest's objective coordinates. It may be invoked
    during quest list refreshes or when determining which quests to highlight for
    the player.
