  signature: uint32 MageAI::GetMana()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current mana amount of the MageAI-controlled unit
  description: The GetMana method retrieves the current mana value of the mage AI
    unit. This method is typically used by the MageAI class to determine how much
    mana is available for casting spells. The returned value represents the actual
    current mana points, which may be updated during combat or spellcasting operations.
    This information is crucial for decision-making in the AI's spell selection and
    casting logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current mana amount of the MageAI unit.
    Returns 0 if the unit has no mana or if the unit is not a valid mage instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 currentMana = mageAI->GetMana();\nif (currentMana > 50)\n{\n   \
      \ // Cast a spell that requires at least 50 mana\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Mana Check for Spell Casting
    code: "uint32 requiredMana = 100;\nuint32 currentMana = mageAI->GetMana();\nif\
      \ (currentMana >= requiredMana)\n{\n    // Proceed with high-mana spell\n  \
      \  mageAI->CastSpell(SPELL_FIREBALL);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Switch to lower-mana\
      \ alternative\n    mageAI->CastSpell(SPELL_FROST_NOVA);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the MageAI unit's mana tracking.
    The value returned may change dynamically during combat as spells are cast or
    mana is restored through various means such as regen or potions.
