documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with a character specialization entry
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitwise
    flags that define various properties and behaviors of a character specialization.
    These flags are used internally by the TrinityCore server to determine specialization-specific
    mechanics such as spell availability, talent point allocation, and class-specific
    abilities. The returned value is typically used in conditional logic within game
    systems to apply different behaviors based on the specialization's defined characteristics.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value containing bitwise flags that represent various properties
    of the character specialization. Each bit in the returned integer corresponds
    to a specific flag indicating different aspects such as class restrictions, spell
    availability, or gameplay mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specialization has a specific flag
    code: "ChrSpecializationEntry* spec = sCharSpecStore.LookupEntry(123);\nif (spec\
      \ && (spec->GetFlags() & 0x01)) {\n    // Specialization has the first flag\
      \ enabled\n    printf(\"Specialization supports primary ability\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use flags to determine specialization capabilities
    code: "ChrSpecializationEntry* spec = sCharSpecStore.LookupEntry(player->GetSpecializationId());\n\
      int flags = spec ? spec->GetFlags() : 0;\nif (flags & 0x10) {\n    // This specialization\
      \ allows dual-wielding\n    player->SetCanDualWield(true);\n} else if (flags\
      \ & 0x20) {\n    // This specialization has a special resource system\n    player->SetSpecialResourceType(SPECIAL_RESOURCE_ENERGY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flag values are defined in the game's database and may vary between different
    World of Warcraft client versions. Developers should consult the TrinityCore documentation
    or source code to understand the meaning of specific flag bits. This method is
    commonly used in player class and specialization validation logic.
  warnings: The returned integer value represents a packed set of flags, so bitwise
    operations must be used correctly to check individual flag states. Direct comparison
    with flag values (e.g., == 1) may not work as expected due to the packed nature
    of the data.
