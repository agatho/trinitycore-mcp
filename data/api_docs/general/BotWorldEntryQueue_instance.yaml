documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotWorldEntryQueue class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotWorldEntryQueue
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this queue exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access the global queue managing bot
    world entry requests or operations within the TrinityCore framework. The returned
    pointer provides access to all queue-related functionality including adding entries,
    processing queued items, and managing the bot world entry workflow. This implementation
    is thread-safe and designed for use in multi-threaded environments typical of
    World of Warcraft server implementations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotWorldEntryQueue instance. The method will always
    return a valid pointer to the singleton instance, never NULL.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the singleton instance
    code: 'BotWorldEntryQueue* queue = BotWorldEntryQueue::instance();

      // Use the queue for bot world entry operations

      queue->AddEntry(botEntry);

      queue->ProcessEntries();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using instance in a bot management context
    code: "class BotManager\n{\npublic:\n    void QueueBotWorldEntry(Bot* bot)\n \
      \   {\n        BotWorldEntryQueue* queue = BotWorldEntryQueue::instance();\n\
      \        queue->AddEntry(new BotWorldEntry(bot));\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern with lazy initialization.
    The instance is created on first access and persists for the lifetime of the application.
    As a singleton, it should be used carefully in unit testing scenarios where multiple
    instances might be required for isolation.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, avoid creating multiple instances manually
    or relying on global state for testability. Be cautious when mocking or stubbing
    this method in unit tests as it may affect other parts of the system that depend
    on the same instance.
