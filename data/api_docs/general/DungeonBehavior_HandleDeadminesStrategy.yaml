  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: HandleDeadminesStrategy
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleDeadminesStrategy(Group * group, uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the Deadmines dungeon strategy for a given group and encounter ID.
  description: The HandleDeadminesStrategy method is responsible for executing the
    specific AI behavior and tactical decisions required when a group of players enters
    the Deadmines dungeon. It takes the group object and an encounter ID to determine
    which phase or boss encounter is currently active, then applies appropriate strategies
    such as positioning, spell usage, or movement patterns. This method integrates
    with the broader DungeonBehavior system to ensure coordinated group actions during
    dungeon encounters. The method does not return any value but modifies the group's
    behavior based on the current encounter state.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group currently
      in the Deadmines dungeon. This parameter is essential for accessing group members
      and coordinating their actions.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the current encounter or boss fight within
      the Deadmines dungeon. Used to determine which specific strategy should be applied
      during the encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a dungeon encounter
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = ...; // Assume group is initialized

      uint32 currentEncounterId = 1234;

      DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.HandleDeadminesStrategy(playerGroup, currentEncounterId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system and assumes that the group
    has already been validated for proper dungeon entry. The encounter ID should correspond
    to a valid Deadmines encounter defined in the game's database.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as it will cause a crash if invalid. Also, the encounterId must be valid or the
    behavior may not execute correctly.
