  class: TerrainMgr
  method: LoadTerrain
  signature: std::shared_ptr<TerrainInfo> TerrainMgr::LoadTerrain(uint32 mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and returns terrain information for the specified map ID.
  description: The LoadTerrain method retrieves or initializes terrain data for a
    given map ID. It is responsible for managing terrain resources within the TrinityCore
    engine, ensuring that each map's heightmaps, liquid data, and other terrain-related
    information are properly loaded and accessible. This method typically handles
    caching to avoid redundant loading of the same map data. The returned TerrainInfo
    object contains all necessary data structures required for collision detection,
    height queries, and other terrain-based gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A shared pointer to a TerrainInfo object containing the loaded terrain
    data for the specified map. Returns nullptr if the map ID is invalid or if terrain
    data cannot be loaded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "std::shared_ptr<TerrainInfo> terrain = sTerrainMgr->LoadTerrain(0);\nif\
      \ (terrain)\n{\n    // Use terrain data\n    uint32 height = terrain->GetHeight(100.0f,\
      \ 200.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "std::shared_ptr<TerrainInfo> terrain = sTerrainMgr->LoadTerrain(1234);\n\
      if (!terrain)\n{\n    // Handle invalid map ID or loading failure\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to load terrain for map 1234\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with terrain\
      \ operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads. The terrain
    data is cached internally, so subsequent calls for the same map ID will return
    a reference to the already-loaded data. Performance is optimized through lazy
    loading of terrain data on-demand.
  warnings: Do not assume that all map IDs have valid terrain data. Some maps may
    be invalid or unsupported, resulting in a null return value. Always check the
    returned pointer before using it.
