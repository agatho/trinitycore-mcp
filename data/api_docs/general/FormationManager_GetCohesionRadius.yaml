  class: FormationManager
  method: GetCohesionRadius
  signature: float FormationManager::GetCohesionRadius() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the cohesion radius value used for formation management.
  description: The GetCohesionRadius method retrieves the current cohesion radius
    setting from the FormationManager. This radius defines how closely units in a
    formation should stay together while moving. The cohesion radius is typically
    used by AI systems to maintain group integrity during movement and combat positioning.
    This value affects the behavior of creatures or NPCs that are part of a formation,
    determining their preferred distance from each other within the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the cohesion radius in world units. This value
    indicates the maximum distance that formation members should maintain from each
    other while moving together.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve cohesion radius for a formation
    code: "float cohesionRadius = formationManager->GetCohesionRadius();\nif (cohesionRadius\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the cohesion radius value for some logic\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Current cohesion radius: \" << cohesionRadius << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during formation update cycles to determine
    current movement behavior. The returned value may be modified by other methods
    in the FormationManager class, such as SetCohesionRadius(). This method is thread-safe
    and does not modify any internal state.
