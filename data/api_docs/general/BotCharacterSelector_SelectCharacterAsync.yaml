  signature: void BotCharacterSelector::SelectCharacterAsync(const int & request,
    int callback)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an asynchronous character selection process for a bot character.
  description: The SelectCharacterAsync method is used to asynchronously initiate
    the process of selecting a character for a bot in the TrinityCore environment.
    This method typically handles the logic required to choose an appropriate character
    from a pool or list, potentially based on criteria such as level, class, or availability.
    The asynchronous nature allows the game loop to continue processing other events
    while the selection is being handled in the background. This method is commonly
    used within bot management systems to dynamically assign characters for automated
    gameplay activities.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: A reference to an integer that represents the request identifier
      or criteria for character selection. This value may indicate which character
      to select, a priority level, or other selection parameters.
  - name: callback
    description: An integer representing the callback function identifier or index
      that will be invoked upon completion of the character selection process. This
      allows the system to execute specific logic after the selection is finalized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Character Selection
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      int requestId = 1001;

      int callbackId = 2001;

      selector.SelectCharacterAsync(requestId, callbackId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Dynamic Request Values
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      int requestId = GetNextAvailableCharacterId();

      int callbackId = GetCallbackForCharacterSelection();

      selector.SelectCharacterAsync(requestId, callbackId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be non-blocking and should not interfere with
    the main game loop. The actual character selection logic may involve database
    queries or other resource-intensive operations that are deferred until a later
    point in the execution cycle.
  warnings: Ensure that the callback identifier corresponds to a valid registered
    callback function; otherwise, the system may encounter undefined behavior or crashes
    upon completion of the asynchronous operation.
