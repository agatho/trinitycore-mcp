  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool BotSpawnerOptimized::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot spawner is currently enabled and active in the game
    world.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the BotSpawnerOptimized component
    is currently active and allowed to spawn bots within the TrinityCore instance.
    This method typically checks internal state flags or configuration settings that
    control the overall operation of the bot spawning system. The return value indicates
    whether the spawner is ready to process spawn requests and manage bot lifecycle
    events. This functionality is crucial for server administrators who may need to
    temporarily disable bot spawning during maintenance or testing periods.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot spawner is enabled and operational, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that either the system has been disabled
    via configuration, or internal conditions prevent spawning from occurring.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botSpawner.IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with bot-related operations\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"worldserver\", \"Bot spawner is enabled, proceeding with spawns\"\
      );\n} else {\n    LOG_WARNING(\"worldserver\", \"Bot spawner is disabled, skipping\
      \ spawns\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a lightweight check that accesses internal boolean
    flags rather than performing complex operations. It's recommended to cache the
    result of this call if it's used frequently in performance-critical sections of
    code.
