documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Discipline Priest bot with default settings and behavior configurations.
  description: The DisciplinePriestRefactored constructor initializes a new instance
    of the DisciplinePriestRefactored class, setting up the bot's core attributes,
    abilities, and AI behavior for a Discipline Priest character in World of Warcraft.
    This method configures the bot's spell selection, cooldown management, and combat
    strategies specific to the Discipline Priest specialization. It prepares the bot
    for gameplay by establishing its initial state, including health management, mana
    optimization, and targeted healing priorities. The initialization process ensures
    that all necessary data structures are properly allocated and configured before
    the bot becomes active in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'DisciplinePriestRefactored* priestBot = new DisciplinePriestRefactored(playerBot);

      // Bot is now initialized with default Discipline Priest behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    parameter must not be null and should represent a valid player character in the
    game world. The initialization process may take several milliseconds to complete
    depending on the complexity of the AI configuration.
  warnings: Calling this constructor multiple times on the same object will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and represents
    an active player before calling this constructor.
