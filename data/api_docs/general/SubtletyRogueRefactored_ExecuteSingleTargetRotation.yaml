  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void SubtletyRogueRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the subtlety rogue's single-target combat rotation logic.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core decision-making
    logic for a subtlety rogue when engaging a single enemy target. This method evaluates
    the current combat state, available abilities, and resource levels to determine
    the optimal sequence of actions. It typically involves checking for combo points,
    energy management, and applying appropriate abilities such as Sinister Strike,
    Backstab, or Eviscerate based on the rogue's current situation. The method is
    designed to be called during the AI update cycle when the rogue has a valid single
    target to attack.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object that the rogue will perform the rotation
      against. Must be a valid GameObject or Unit pointer representing an enemy unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void SubtletyRogueRefactored::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target\
      \ = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n    {\n        ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Combat Logic
    code: "void SubtletyRogueRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int* target)\n\
      {\n    if (!target || !(*target))\n        return;\n\n    Unit* unitTarget =\
      \ ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*this, *target);\n    if (!unitTarget || !unitTarget->IsAlive())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Core rotation logic here\n    // e.g., check for\
      \ combo points, energy, and ability availability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the rogue has an active target. The
    parameter 'target' is expected to be a pointer to a valid game object ID, not
    a direct reference. The implementation assumes that the AI framework handles targeting
    and state management.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly validated before use to prevent
    null pointer dereferences. This method does not handle target switching or movement
    logic; it only executes the rotation sequence for the current target.
