documentation:
  brief: Returns the session bonus for the quest, which is used to determine the experience
    reward and gold rewards.
  description: The GetQuestSessionBonus method retrieves the session bonus value associated
    with a specific quest. This value is typically used to calculate the experience
    points and gold rewards that players receive when completing quests. The session
    bonus is usually determined by the quest's level relative to the player's level,
    and it affects how much experience and gold the player receives. This method is
    commonly used in conjunction with other quest-related functions to determine reward
    scaling for completed quests.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the session bonus for the quest.
    This value typically ranges from 0 to 100, where higher values indicate more significant
    rewards. A value of 0 means no bonus or the player is too low level compared to
    the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int32 sessionBonus = quest->GetQuestSessionBonus();

      int32 experienceReward = sessionBonus * 100;

      int32 goldReward = sessionBonus * 50;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the context of quest reward calculations
    and may be affected by player level differences relative to the quest. The session
    bonus value can be influenced by factors such as quest level, player's level,
    and game mechanics like quest scaling.
  warnings: Be aware that this method might return 0 if the player is significantly
    below the quest level, which could result in no experience or gold rewards being
    awarded.
