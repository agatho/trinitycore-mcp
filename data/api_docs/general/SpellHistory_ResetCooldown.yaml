  class: SpellHistory
  method: ResetCooldown
  signature: void SpellHistory::ResetCooldown(int spellId, bool update)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the cooldown for a specified spell in the spell history.
  description: The ResetCooldown method removes or clears the cooldown timer associated
    with a given spell ID from the SpellHistory object. This allows the spell to be
    cast immediately without waiting for its cooldown period to expire. The method
    can optionally trigger an update to synchronize the cooldown state with the client.
    Cooldowns are typically managed per-character and are used to enforce game balance
    by preventing excessive use of powerful abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell whose cooldown should be reset.
      This corresponds to the Spell ID used in the game's database.
  - name: update
    description: If true, sends an update packet to the client to reflect the cooldown
      reset. If false, only resets internally without notifying the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset cooldown for a spell and notify client
    code: 'SpellHistory* history = player->GetSpellHistory();

      history->ResetCooldown(12345, true); // Reset cooldown for spell ID 12345 and
      update client'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset cooldown silently without updating client
    code: 'SpellHistory* history = player->GetSpellHistory();

      history->ResetCooldown(67890, false); // Reset cooldown for spell ID 67890 without
      notifying client'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used when applying effects like 'Instant Cooldown'
    or 'Spell Reflection' that immediately reset a spell's cooldown. It is important
    to consider the update flag, as failing to send an update may cause the client
    to display outdated cooldown information.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spell ID might lead to undefined behavior
    or errors in the spell history management system. Always ensure that the spell
    ID exists and is valid before calling ResetCooldown.
