  class: CharacterCache
  method: GetCharacterCacheByGuid
  signature: const CharacterCacheEntry * CharacterCache::GetCharacterCacheByGuid(const
    int & guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a character cache entry by its unique identifier (GUID) from the
    character cache.
  description: The GetCharacterCacheByGuid method fetches a cached character entry
    using the provided GUID. This method is typically used to access pre-loaded character
    data without performing expensive database queries. The returned pointer points
    to an immutable cache entry that should not be modified directly. The method performs
    a lookup in an internal hash map or similar data structure indexed by GUID, making
    it efficient for frequent lookups during gameplay operations such as player interactions,
    guild management, or zone-based events.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character to retrieve from cache.
      This value is typically obtained from player objects or database records and
      uniquely identifies a specific character within the game world.
  returns: A pointer to a const CharacterCacheEntry object if the character with the
    specified GUID exists in the cache; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching
    entry is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const CharacterCacheEntry* entry = CharacterCache::GetCharacterCacheByGuid(playerGuid);\n\
      if (entry != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the cached character data\n    std::string\
      \ name = entry->name;\n    uint32_t level = entry->level;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "int32_t playerGuid = 123456;\nconst CharacterCacheEntry* cacheEntry = CharacterCache::GetCharacterCacheByGuid(playerGuid);\n\
      if (cacheEntry != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process character data safely\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player %s is level %u\", cacheEntry->name.c_str(), cacheEntry->level);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"Character with GUID %d not found in cache.\",\
      \ playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the character cache has been properly populated
    with data, usually during server startup or when a character logs in. Accessing
    this method from multiple threads may require synchronization if the underlying
    cache structure is not thread-safe. The returned pointer remains valid only as
    long as the cache entry exists and is not invalidated by cache updates or evictions.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned CharacterCacheEntry object directly, as it's
    const. Modifying cached data can lead to inconsistencies between in-memory state
    and database records. Also, be aware that if a character is deleted from the database
    but still cached, this method will continue returning the old cached entry until
    cache invalidation occurs.
