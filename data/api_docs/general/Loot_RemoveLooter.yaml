  class: Loot
  method: RemoveLooter
  signature: void Loot::RemoveLooter(int GUID)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a looter from the loot object based on the provided GUID.
  description: The RemoveLooter method removes a specific player or creature from
    the list of potential looters for a given loot object. This is typically used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore when a player finishes looting an item and
    should no longer be considered for further loot distribution. The method ensures
    that the specified GUID is removed from internal tracking structures, preventing
    duplicate loot claims and maintaining proper loot state management. It does not
    directly handle item removal or distribution; rather, it manages the looter list
    associated with the loot object.
  parameters:
  - name: GUID
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player or creature to be removed
      from the looter list. This should correspond to a valid entity in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Player Looter
    code: 'Loot* loot = ...; // Assume loot object is initialized

      uint32 playerGUID = 12345;

      loot->RemoveLooter(playerGUID);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Multiple Looters
    code: "Loot* loot = ...;\nstd::vector<uint32> looters = {1001, 1002, 1003};\n\
      for (uint32 guid : looters)\n{\n    loot->RemoveLooter(guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the loot system when a player
    finishes looting an item. It's important to ensure that the GUID passed corresponds
    to a valid looter in the current loot context. The method may not perform any
    action if the GUID is not found in the looter list, which is generally safe but
    could indicate an inconsistency in the calling logic.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID might result
    in no-op behavior, potentially leading to unexpected loot state. Ensure that all
    GUIDs passed are valid and correspond to entities currently in the loot context
    to avoid inconsistencies.
