  class: RuneInfo
  method: RuneInfo
  signature: void RuneInfo::RuneInfo(RuneType t)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a RuneInfo object with the specified rune type.
  description: The RuneInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the RuneInfo
    class, setting its internal rune type to the provided value. This class is typically
    used within the context of World of Warcraft's combat system to represent rune
    data for player characters, particularly those belonging to Death Knights. The
    rune type determines the nature and behavior of the rune, such as whether it's
    a blood, frost, or unholy rune. This constructor is usually invoked internally
    by the game engine when managing player rune states during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The RuneType enumeration value that specifies the type of rune to
      initialize this RuneInfo object with. Valid values are typically blood, frost,
      and unholy runes as defined in the RuneType enum.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: RuneInfo bloodRune(RuneType::Blood);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Multiple Runes
    code: 'RuneInfo runes[6];

      runes[0] = RuneInfo(RuneType::Blood);

      runes[1] = RuneInfo(RuneType::Frost);

      runes[2] = RuneInfo(RuneType::Unholy);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal rune management system in TrinityCore.
    It's not typically called directly by custom scripts or addons, but rather through
    higher-level APIs that manage player rune states. The RuneInfo class likely stores
    additional data such as rune cooldowns and activation status.
  warnings: When working with rune-related systems, ensure proper synchronization
    of rune states across the game world to prevent desynchronization issues. Direct
    instantiation of RuneInfo objects should be done carefully to avoid inconsistencies
    in the player's rune state management.
