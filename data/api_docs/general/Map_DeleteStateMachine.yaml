  class: Map
  method: DeleteStateMachine
  signature: void Map::DeleteStateMachine()
documentation:
  brief: Deletes the state machine associated with this map instance.
  description: The DeleteStateMachine method is responsible for cleaning up and removing
    the state machine that manages the logical flow and behavior of the map. This
    typically occurs during map destruction or when transitioning between different
    game states. The method ensures proper resource deallocation and prevents memory
    leaks related to state management components. It should only be called when the
    map is no longer in use or when explicitly required for state transitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Map Cleanup
    code: "void CleanupMap(Map* map)\n{\n    if (map)\n    {\n        map->DeleteStateMachine();\n\
      \        // Further cleanup operations\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core engine during map
    lifecycle management. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom map behavior or state machine management. The operation is expected to
    be thread-safe if called from a context where the map is not actively being accessed
    by other threads.
  warnings: Calling DeleteStateMachine on an already deleted or invalid state machine
    may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all references to the state machine
    are properly managed and that no active operations are pending before invoking
    this method.
