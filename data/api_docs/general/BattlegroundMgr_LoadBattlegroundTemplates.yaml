documentation:
  brief: Loads all battleground templates from the database into memory for use in
    the game world.
  description: The LoadBattlegroundTemplates method initializes and populates the
    internal data structures of the BattlegroundMgr class with battleground template
    information retrieved from the database. This method is typically called during
    server startup or when battleground data needs to be refreshed. It ensures that
    all available battleground types, their properties, and configurations are loaded
    and ready for matchmaking and instantiation. The method performs database queries
    to fetch battleground definitions including entry points, team sizes, rewards,
    and other relevant parameters necessary for battleground operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'BattlegroundMgr* bgMgr = sBattlegroundMgr;

      bgMgr->LoadBattlegroundTemplates();

      // This loads all battleground templates into memory for use in the game world.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked once during server startup and should not
    be called repeatedly unless the underlying battleground data has changed and needs
    to be reloaded. The loaded templates are cached in memory for fast access during
    battleground matchmaking and creation. This method may block briefly while performing
    database queries.
