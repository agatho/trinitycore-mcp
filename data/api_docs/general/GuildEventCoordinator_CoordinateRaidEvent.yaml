  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: CoordinateRaidEvent
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::CoordinateRaidEvent(int * leader, uint32
    eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates a raid event for the guild by assigning a leader and event identifier.
  description: 'The CoordinateRaidEvent method is responsible for managing guild raid
    events within the TrinityCore framework. It assigns a specific player as the leader
    of a raid event and associates it with a unique event identifier. This method
    likely handles event synchronization, player assignment, and state management
    for guild raid activities. The method operates on the GuildEventCoordinator class
    which manages various guild-related events and their coordination mechanisms.
    Precondition: The leader parameter must point to a valid player identifier, and
    eventId should correspond to an existing raid event in the system.'
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID of the raid leader.
      Must be a valid guild member identifier.
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier for the raid event to be coordinated. Should correspond
      to a registered raid event in the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Raid Event Coordination
    code: 'int leaderId = 12345;

      uint32 eventId = 67890;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CoordinateRaidEvent(&leaderId, eventId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild event queues and may trigger
    notifications to guild members. Implementation details suggest it might handle
    event state transitions and player role assignments for raid activities.
  warnings: Ensure that the leader parameter points to a valid guild member, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur. The eventId must be registered in the system or
    the method may fail silently or cause synchronization issues.
