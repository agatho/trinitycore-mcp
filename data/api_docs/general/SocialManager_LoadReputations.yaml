  signature: void SocialManager::LoadReputations()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes player reputation data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadReputations method is responsible for retrieving all reputation
    records associated with a player from the database and loading them into the in-memory
    social manager structure. This method ensures that a player's faction standings,
    including their current standing, cap values, and any custom reputation modifiers,
    are properly initialized when the player logs in or when the social system is
    refreshed. It typically executes during the player session initialization phase
    and is crucial for maintaining accurate faction relationships within the game
    world. The method does not accept any parameters and performs no direct return
    operations; instead, it populates internal data structures that are used by other
    social manager functions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login Context
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    // Other login logic...\n    sSocialMgr->LoadReputations();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization steps\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during player session setup
    and should not be called manually unless specifically required for data synchronization.
    It may involve database queries that could impact performance if executed frequently
    or on large datasets.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the expected initialization flow can lead
    to inconsistent reputation states or duplicate entries in the internal data structures.
    Ensure proper locking mechanisms are used if invoked from multiple threads.
