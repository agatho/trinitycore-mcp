  class: AuctionHouseObject
  method: BuildReplicate
  signature: void AuctionHouseObject::BuildReplicate(WorldPackets::AuctionHouse::AuctionReplicateResponse
    & replicateResponse, Player * player, uint32 global, uint32 cursor, uint32 tombstone,
    uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Populates an auction replicate response packet with auction house data for
    a player.
  description: The BuildReplicate method constructs and fills a WorldPackets::AuctionHouse::AuctionReplicateResponse
    packet with relevant auction house data for a specified player. This method is
    typically invoked when a player requests to view their auction listings or when
    the server needs to synchronize auction information with the client. It utilizes
    parameters such as global, cursor, tombstone, and count to determine which portion
    of the auction data to include in the response packet. The method ensures that
    only valid auction items are sent based on the provided filters and player permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: replicateResponse
    description: Reference to the AuctionReplicateResponse packet that will be populated
      with auction data.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the auction data is being prepared.
      Used to determine valid auctions and permissions.
  - name: global
    description: Global filter value used to determine which auctions should be included
      in the response. Typically represents a category or region identifier.
  - name: cursor
    description: Cursor position indicating where to start retrieving auction data
      from. Used for pagination of results.
  - name: tombstone
    description: Tombstone value used to filter out expired or removed auctions. Helps
      maintain data consistency between client and server.
  - name: count
    description: Number of auction items to include in the response packet. Controls
      how many items are sent per request.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'WorldPackets::AuctionHouse::AuctionReplicateResponse replicatePacket;

      Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      uint32 globalFilter = 0;

      uint32 cursorPos = 0;

      uint32 tombstoneValue = 1;

      uint32 itemCount = 50;


      auctionHouse->BuildReplicate(replicatePacket, player, globalFilter, cursorPos,
      tombstoneValue, itemCount);

      player->SendDirectMessage(&replicatePacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AuctionHouseObject instance has been properly
    initialized and contains valid auction data. It's important to ensure that player
    permissions are checked before calling this method, as unauthorized access could
    lead to data leakage or incorrect behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of cursor values may result in incomplete or duplicate
    auction listings being sent to the client. Ensure that tombstone values are correctly
    managed to avoid sending expired auctions.
