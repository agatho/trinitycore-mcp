  class: Garrison
  method: InitializePlots
  signature: void Garrison::InitializePlots()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes all plots within a garrison with default values and configurations.
  description: The InitializePlots method sets up all plots in a garrison by assigning
    default properties, clearing any existing plot data, and preparing them for use.
    This method is typically called during garrison creation or reset operations to
    ensure that all plots are properly initialized with their base state. It handles
    the internal setup of plot structures including their types, levels, and availability
    status. The method ensures that each plot within the garrison has a consistent
    initial configuration regardless of previous state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();

      garrison->InitializePlots();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the garrison is in a valid state for
    initialization. It's typically invoked during garrison creation or after a reset
    operation. The method does not validate whether plots already exist, so calling
    it on an already initialized garrison may result in unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling InitializePlots on an active garrison with existing structures
    may cause data loss or corruption. This method should only be used during initialization
    phases and never during active gameplay operations.
