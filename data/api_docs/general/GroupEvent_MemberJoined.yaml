  signature: GroupEvent GroupEvent::MemberJoined(int groupGuid, int memberGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a GroupEvent object representing a member joining a group
  description: 'The MemberJoined method constructs and returns a GroupEvent instance
    that signifies a player has joined a specific group. This event is typically used
    within TrinityCore''s group management system to track membership changes and
    propagate notifications throughout the game world. The method takes two GUID parameters:
    the group identifier and the member identifier, and returns a properly initialized
    GroupEvent object that can be processed by event handlers or dispatched to clients.'
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group to which the member is
      joining. Must be a valid existing group GUID within the game world.
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player member who is joining
      the group. Must be a valid existing player GUID within the game world.
  returns: A GroupEvent object representing the event of a member joining a group.
    This object contains all necessary metadata about the event and can be used for
    further processing, logging, or client notification.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to create a group join event
    code: 'GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::MemberJoined(12345, 67890);

      // event now represents a player with GUID 67890 joining group with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the event in a group management context
    code: "void HandlePlayerJoinGroup(Player* player, Group* group) {\n    GroupEvent\
      \ event = GroupEvent::MemberJoined(group->GetGUID(), player->GetGUID());\n \
      \   // Process the event or send to clients\n    sWorld->SendGlobalMessage(\"\
      Player \" + player->GetName() + \" joined the group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on whether the GUIDs actually
    exist in the database. It is assumed that the caller has already validated these
    identifiers. The returned GroupEvent object should be used immediately or stored
    for later processing as it may contain references to transient data.
  warnings: Ensure that both groupGuid and memberGuid are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior in downstream systems. This
    method is typically called from within the group management subsystem and should
    not be invoked directly by external modules without proper context.
