  class: MonkAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void MonkAI::ConsumeResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes resource costs associated with a specified monk spell.
  description: The ConsumeResource method handles the deduction of necessary resources
    such as energy, chi, or other monk-specific currency when a monk player casts
    a spell. This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system to ensure
    proper resource management during spell execution. It ensures that the required
    resources are subtracted from the monk's current resource pool before the spell
    is cast, preventing invalid or out-of-resource spell casting.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the monk spell being cast. This ID determines
      which resource costs are applied based on the spell's requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "void MyClass::CastHealingSpell()\n{\n    // Assume this is called when\
      \ a monk casts a healing spell\n    m_monkAI->ConsumeResource(12345); // ID\
      \ of the healing spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Resource Deduction
    code: "void MonkAI::OnSpellCast(int spellId)\n{\n    if (CanAffordSpell(spellId))\n\
      \    {\n        ConsumeResource(spellId);\n        // Proceed with spell casting\
      \ logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the spell ID corresponds to a valid monk spell with
    defined resource costs. It does not perform validation on whether sufficient resources
    exist; it simply deducts them. The actual resource deduction behavior may vary
    depending on the specific spell and game mechanics.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method without checking resource availability can
    lead to negative resource values, which may cause unexpected behavior in gameplay
    or AI decision-making. Always validate resource availability before calling this
    method.
