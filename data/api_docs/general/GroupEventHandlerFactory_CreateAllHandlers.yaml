documentation:
  brief: Initializes and registers all group event handlers for the specified BotAI
    instance
  description: The CreateAllHandlers method is responsible for setting up and registering
    all available group event handlers within the TrinityCore AI framework. This method
    ensures that a BotAI instance can properly respond to various group-related events
    such as member joins, leaves, role changes, and other group dynamics. It typically
    iterates through predefined handler types and attaches them to the bot's event
    system. The method returns an integer status code indicating success or failure
    of the initialization process. This is a critical function for enabling proper
    group behavior in AI-controlled bots within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns 0 on successful initialization of all handlers, or a non-zero error
    code if one or more handlers failed to register. A positive return value typically
    indicates the number of failed handler registrations, while a negative value may
    indicate a critical failure during setup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Initialization
    code: "BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();\nint result = GroupEventHandlerFactory::CreateAllHandlers(botAI);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // All handlers successfully created and registered\n\
      \    printf(\"Group event handlers initialized successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle initialization failure\n    printf(\"Failed to initialize %d\
      \ group event handlers\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during bot initialization or when
    a new group is formed. The method assumes that the BotAI instance has been properly
    constructed and initialized before calling. It may perform memory allocations
    for handler objects and register them with the AI's event system, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly configured BotAI
    instance may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method does not validate
    whether the bot is actually part of a group - it simply registers all possible
    handlers. Ensure that the bot's group membership status is properly managed separately.
