  signature: int64 Spell::GetUnitTargetCountForEffect(int effect) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of unit targets for a specified spell effect.
  description: This method retrieves the number of unit targets affected by a specific
    spell effect. It is commonly used in spell handling to determine how many targets
    a spell will affect, particularly when dealing with area-of-effect spells or spells
    that target multiple units. The method returns an integer value representing the
    count of targets, which can be useful for determining spell effectiveness or calculating
    damage based on target count. This functionality is essential for understanding
    spell mechanics and implementing proper spell logic in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int64 value representing the number of unit targets affected
    by the specified spell effect. A value of 0 indicates no targets were found, while
    positive values indicate the count of targets. Negative values may indicate an
    error condition or invalid effect index.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int64 targetCount = spell->GetUnitTargetCountForEffect(0);\nif (targetCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process targets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine target count for effects. The method may return 0 if no targets are
    found or if the effect index is invalid. Performance considerations include checking
    for valid effect indices before calling this method.
  warnings: The method may return negative values if an invalid effect index is passed,
    which could lead to incorrect calculations. Always verify that the effect index
    is within valid bounds before calling this method.
