  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: GetOptimalStrategy
  signature: OptimizationStrategy PerformanceOptimizer::GetOptimalStrategy(uint32_t
    botGuid, OptimizationGoal goal)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal optimization strategy for a specific bot
    based on its GUID and assigned goal.
  description: The GetOptimalStrategy method evaluates the current state and requirements
    of a bot identified by its unique Game Object ID (GUID) to determine the most
    efficient optimization approach. It considers various factors such as resource
    availability, task priority, and environmental conditions to select an appropriate
    strategy from a predefined set of optimization techniques. This method is typically
    used in automated AI systems within TrinityCore to dynamically adjust bot behavior
    for maximum performance or efficiency. The returned OptimizationStrategy object
    encapsulates the chosen approach which may include pathfinding adjustments, resource
    allocation decisions, or behavioral modifications.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to determine the
      optimal strategy. Must be a valid GameObject GUID within the TrinityCore instance.
  - name: goal
    description: The OptimizationGoal enum value specifying what objective the bot
      should optimize for, such as speed, efficiency, or resource conservation.
  returns: An OptimizationStrategy enum value representing the determined optimal
    strategy for the specified bot and goal. Possible values include but are not limited
    to STRATEGY_PATHFINDING, STRATEGY_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT, or STRATEGY_BEHAVIOR_ADJUSTMENT.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      OptimizationGoal goal = OPTIMIZE_FOR_SPEED;

      OptimizationStrategy strategy = optimizer.GetOptimalStrategy(botGuid, goal);

      // Use the returned strategy to configure bot behavior'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Strategy Application
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nOptimizationGoal goal\
      \ = OPTIMIZE_FOR_ENERGY;\nOptimizationStrategy strategy = optimizer.GetOptimalStrategy(botGuid,\
      \ goal);\nswitch (strategy) {\n    case STRATEGY_PATHFINDING:\n        // Apply\
      \ pathfinding optimization\n        break;\n    case STRATEGY_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT:\n\
      \        // Apply resource management logic\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Default behavior\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database lookups or complex calculations depending
    on the implementation. It is recommended to cache results when repeatedly querying
    strategies for the same bot. The method assumes that the provided botGuid corresponds
    to an active and valid bot within the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter refers to a valid GameObject; otherwise,
    the behavior is undefined. The method should not be called on bots that are currently
    in an invalid state or have been destroyed.
