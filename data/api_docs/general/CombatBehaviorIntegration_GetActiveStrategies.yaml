  method: GetActiveStrategies
  signature: uint32 CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetActiveStrategies() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bitmask of active combat strategies currently configured for
    the unit.
  description: The GetActiveStrategies method returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing
    the bitmask of all currently active combat strategies assigned to this unit. This
    bitmask is used internally by the TrinityCore AI system to determine which behavior
    strategies are currently enabled and should be executed during combat. The returned
    value combines flags from various strategy types such as melee, ranged, spellcasting,
    and defensive behaviors. This method does not modify any internal state and can
    be called safely during combat or non-combat scenarios. It is typically used by
    AI systems to make decisions about which actions to perform based on the active
    strategies.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing a bitmask of active combat strategies. Each
    bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific strategy type, where set bits
    indicate that the corresponding strategy is currently active. Common strategy
    flags might include melee combat, ranged attacks, spell casting, defensive maneuvers,
    and other tactical behaviors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 activeStrategies = creature->GetCombatBehavior()->GetActiveStrategies();\n\
      if (activeStrategies & STRATEGY_MELEE)\n{\n    // Perform melee combat actions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy Checking
    code: "uint32 strategies = unit->GetCombatBehavior()->GetActiveStrategies();\n\
      if (strategies & (STRATEGY_RANGED | STRATEGY_SPELLCASTING))\n{\n    // Unit\
      \ has both ranged and spellcasting strategies active\n    // Can perform ranged\
      \ attacks or cast spells\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a cached value that may not reflect real-time changes
    to strategy assignments. The bitmask is typically updated when strategies are
    explicitly enabled or disabled via other methods in the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    class. The implementation relies on internal strategy management and should be
    used in conjunction with other AI-related methods for complete behavior control.
  warnings: The returned bitmask value should not be modified directly as it represents
    a snapshot of current active strategies. Modifying this value could lead to inconsistent
    AI behavior. Always use the appropriate setter or enable/disable methods to modify
    strategy states rather than manipulating the returned bitmask directly.
