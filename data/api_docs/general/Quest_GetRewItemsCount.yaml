  class: Quest
  method: GetRewItemsCount
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetRewItemsCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of items that are rewarded upon completion of a quest.
  description: The GetRewItemsCount method retrieves the number of items that will
    be awarded to the player when they complete the quest. This method is part of
    the Quest class in TrinityCore and provides information about the reward structure
    of the quest. The returned value represents how many item rewards are associated
    with the quest, which can be zero for quests that don't provide item rewards or
    a positive number for quests that do. This count is used by the game engine to
    determine how many items to give to the player upon quest completion.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the number of item rewards associated with the quest. This value
    can be zero if no items are rewarded, or a positive integer if items are provided
    as rewards. The return value represents the count of items that will be given
    to the player upon quest completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Quest* quest = player->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nuint32 rewardCount = quest->GetRewItemsCount();\n\
      if (rewardCount > 0)\n{\n    // Handle item rewards\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine the complete reward structure of a quest. It's important to note
    that this count may not include all types of rewards, such as experience points
    or gold. The method is part of the standard Quest API and should be used carefully
    when implementing quest completion logic.
  warnings: This method does not account for quest rewards that might be given through
    other means like experience points or gold. It only returns item reward count,
    so developers must ensure they're considering all reward types when handling quest
    completion.
