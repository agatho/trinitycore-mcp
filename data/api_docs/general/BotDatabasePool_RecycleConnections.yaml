documentation:
  brief: Releases and returns database connections back to the connection pool for
    reuse.
  description: The RecycleConnections method is responsible for releasing all active
    database connections held by the BotDatabasePool instance back to the underlying
    connection pool. This ensures that database resources are properly managed and
    can be reused by other parts of the application. The method typically gets called
    during cleanup or when the pool needs to be reset, allowing for efficient resource
    utilization and preventing potential connection leaks. It is an essential part
    of the connection lifecycle management within the TrinityCore bot system.

  - title: Basic Usage in Cleanup
    code: "void BotManager::Cleanup()\n{\n    m_botDatabasePool->RecycleConnections();\n\
      \    // Other cleanup operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying the BotDatabasePool instance
    to ensure proper resource cleanup. It's typically invoked automatically during
    pool destruction, but explicit calls may be necessary in certain scenarios where
    early resource release is required.
