documentation:
  brief: Checks if a unit is silenced, preventing spell casting in specific school
    masks
  description: The IsSilenced method determines whether a unit is currently under
    the effects of silence, which prevents them from casting spells. This method checks
    for specific school masks to determine if the unit is silenced in that particular
    magical school. The silence effect typically prevents spell casting and can be
    applied by various game mechanics such as spells, abilities, or environmental
    effects. This method is commonly used in combat situations to determine if a unit
    can cast spells or if they are restricted by silence.
  parameters:
  - name: schoolMask
    description: The magical school mask to check for silence. This parameter defines
      which school of magic the method checks for, such as fire, frost, nature, or
      holy. The value is typically a bitmask representing one or more schools.
  returns: Returns true if the unit is silenced in the specified school mask, false
    otherwise. The method will return false if no silence effect is present or if
    the unit is not silenced in the given school mask.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsSilenced(SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_FIRE))\n{\n    // Unit cannot cast\
      \ fire spells\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple school masks
    code: "bool isSilenced = unit->IsSilenced(SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_FROST | SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_HOLY);\n\
      if (isSilenced)\n{\n    // Unit is silenced in either frost or holy schools\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks against the unit's current aura effects and
    may be used in conjunction with other methods like IsInCombat or IsDead to determine
    if a unit can cast spells. Performance-wise, this method is lightweight as it
    only checks for specific aura effects without complex calculations.
  warnings: The method may return false positives if the unit has multiple silence
    effects applied, or if the school mask is not properly defined. Care should be
    taken when using this method in combat situations where spell casting is restricted.
