  signature: bool InterruptUtils::IsInInterruptDatabase(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell ID exists in the interrupt database.
  description: The IsInInterruptDatabase method determines whether a given spell ID
    is registered in the game's interrupt database. This database typically contains
    spells that can interrupt other spells or abilities, such as silence effects,
    stun spells, or other crowd control mechanics. The method performs a lookup in
    an internal data structure to verify if the specified spell ID corresponds to
    an interruptible spell. It is commonly used during spell casting and combat logic
    to determine if a spell can be interrupted by another ability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell ID exists in the interrupt database,
    indicating that the spell can interrupt other spells or abilities. Returns false
    if the spell ID is not found in the database, meaning it does not have interrupt
    capabilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (InterruptUtils::IsInInterruptDatabase(1725)) {\n    // Spell ID 1725\
      \ (Silence) is in the interrupt database\n    // Proceed with interrupt logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Interrupt Logic
    code: "void HandleSpellInterrupt(uint32 spellId) {\n    if (InterruptUtils::IsInInterruptDatabase(spellId))\
      \ {\n        // This spell can interrupt other abilities\n        // Apply interrupt\
      \ effects\n    } else {\n        // This spell cannot interrupt others\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses a cached or pre-loaded database of spell IDs for
    performance reasons. The implementation may involve hash tables or lookup maps
    for fast access. Developers should be aware that the database is static and loaded
    at server startup, so runtime modifications to interrupt spells are not supported.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual spell in the game's database. Invalid spell IDs may cause undefined
    behavior or incorrect results if they're not properly validated before calling
    this function.
