  signature: PerformanceMetrics ThreadSafeClassAI::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves performance metrics for the thread-safe AI class instance.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a PerformanceMetrics object containing
    detailed performance statistics for the ThreadSafeClassAI instance. This includes
    timing information, execution counts, and resource usage data that can be used
    for profiling and optimization purposes. The returned metrics are thread-safe
    and provide insights into how the AI component performs under various conditions.
    This method is typically used during development and debugging to monitor AI behavior
    and identify potential performance bottlenecks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PerformanceMetrics object containing timing data, execution counts, and
    resource usage statistics for the AI instance. The metrics include information
    such as average execution time, total calls, and memory usage patterns that help
    in understanding the performance characteristics of the thread-safe AI implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Performance Metrics
    code: 'ThreadSafeClassAI* ai = ...;

      PerformanceMetrics metrics = ai->GetMetrics();

      std::cout << "Average execution time: " << metrics.averageTime << "ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and can be called from any thread
    without causing race conditions. The returned PerformanceMetrics object should
    not be modified directly as it may be shared across multiple threads. The metrics
    are updated in real-time as the AI performs its operations.
