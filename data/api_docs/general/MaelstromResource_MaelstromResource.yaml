  brief: Initializes a new MaelstromResource instance with default values.
  description: The MaelstromResource constructor initializes a new instance of the
    MaelstromResource class. This method sets up the internal state of the resource,
    including initializing member variables to their default values. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, MaelstromResource likely represents a resource
    associated with the Maelstrom mechanic, such as a player's mana or energy pool
    that is affected by specific abilities or talents. The constructor ensures that
    all necessary data structures are properly allocated and configured before the
    object can be used in gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of MaelstromResource
    code: 'MaelstromResource resource;

      // Initializes a new MaelstromResource with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating a new instance
    of the MaelstromResource class. Developers should be aware that this method may
    perform memory allocation and initialization operations, so it should not be called
    excessively in performance-critical code paths.
