  class: GroupFormation
  method: RotateFormation
  signature: void GroupFormation::RotateFormation(float angle)
documentation:
  brief: Rotates the group formation by the specified angle around the group's center
    point.
  description: The RotateFormation method adjusts the angular orientation of a group's
    formation in the game world. This method modifies the relative positions of group
    members around a central point, allowing for dynamic tactical positioning during
    combat or movement. The rotation is applied to all group members' positions, maintaining
    their relative distances from the group center while changing their directional
    alignment. This functionality is commonly used in scenarios where groups need
    to reorient themselves for optimal positioning, such as facing a specific direction
    or aligning with environmental features.
  parameters:
  - name: angle
    description: The rotation angle in radians. Positive values rotate counter-clockwise,
      negative values rotate clockwise. The angle is applied relative to the current
      formation orientation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Rotation
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->RotateFormation(M_PI / 4); // Rotate 45 degrees counter-clockwise'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Rotation Based on Target Direction
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      float targetAngle = atan2(targetY - playerY, targetX - playerX);

      float currentAngle = formation->GetOrientation();

      formation->RotateFormation(targetAngle - currentAngle); // Align group with
      target'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the group's formation data structure and may affect
    the positioning of all group members. The rotation is performed in-place without
    creating new positions, making it efficient for frequent updates. The method assumes
    that the group has a valid formation object and that the group members are properly
    initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method while a group is in combat or moving rapidly may cause
    unexpected behavior or visual glitches. Ensure that the group is in a stable state
    before applying rotations. Additionally, repeated small rotations without proper
    synchronization may accumulate floating-point errors over time.
