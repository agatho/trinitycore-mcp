  class: ConversationAI
  method: OnRemove
  signature: void ConversationAI::OnRemove()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the conversation AI from the current context and performs cleanup
    operations.
  description: The OnRemove method is called when a ConversationAI object is being
    removed or destroyed. This method typically handles cleanup tasks such as releasing
    references, unregistering callbacks, or resetting internal state variables. In
    the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method ensures
    that conversation-related AI components are properly deinitialized without leaving
    dangling references or causing memory leaks. The method is part of the AI lifecycle
    management and should be invoked automatically by the system when the conversation
    AI is no longer needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI cleanup
    code: "class MyConversationAI : public ConversationAI {\npublic:\n    void OnRemove()\
      \ override {\n        // Perform cleanup operations\n        CleanupReferences();\n\
      \        ResetState();\n        // Call parent implementation if needed\n  \
      \      ConversationAI::OnRemove();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object destruction or when removing
    AI components from active conversation systems. Developers should ensure that
    any custom cleanup logic in derived classes properly handles resource deallocation
    and prevents access to freed memory. The method may be invoked from different
    threads depending on the system's threading model.
  warnings: Improper implementation of OnRemove can lead to memory leaks or dangling
    references, especially if parent class cleanup is not called. Avoid performing
    operations that might cause exceptions in this method as it's often called during
    object destruction.
