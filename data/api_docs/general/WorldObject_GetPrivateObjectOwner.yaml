documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the private object owner.
  description: The GetPrivateObjectOwner method retrieves the ObjectGuid of the entity
    that owns a private object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, private
    objects are typically associated with player-owned entities such as pets, vehicles,
    or other summoned creatures. This method is essential for identifying the owner
    of these objects in order to manage permissions, ownership-based interactions,
    and proper cleanup when the owner leaves the game or dies. The returned GUID can
    be used to locate the actual WorldObject representing the owner within the game
    world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ObjectGuid representing the unique identifier of the private object's
    owner. If the object has no owner, this method may return an invalid GUID (ObjectGuid::Empty).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Owner
    code: "if (Creature* pet = ...)\n{\n    ObjectGuid ownerGuid = pet->GetPrivateObjectOwner();\n\
      \    if (!ownerGuid.IsEmpty())\n    {\n        Player* owner = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ownerGuid);\n\
      \        if (owner)\n        {\n            // Use the owner\n        }\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with private object management
    systems where objects are tied to a specific player or creature. The implementation
    assumes that private objects maintain an internal reference to their owner's GUID,
    which should be set during creation or assignment.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without verifying its validity
    first. Always check if the GUID is empty before attempting to retrieve the associated
    WorldObject from the ObjectAccessor to prevent potential crashes or undefined
    behavior.
