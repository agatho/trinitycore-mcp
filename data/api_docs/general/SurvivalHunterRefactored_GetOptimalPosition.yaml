  class: SurvivalHunterRefactored
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int SurvivalHunterRefactored::GetOptimalPosition(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position for the survival hunter to maintain
    maximum damage output while staying safe.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best location for a survival
    hunter to stand during combat, considering factors such as enemy proximity, available
    cover, line of sight to target, and threat distribution. This method is typically
    used by AI systems to guide player behavior in optimal positioning scenarios.
    The returned value represents an index or identifier corresponding to a calculated
    position within a predefined set of tactical locations. The method may consider
    environmental constraints like terrain height differences, obstruction levels,
    and distance from the hunter's current location.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the index or identifier of the optimal position
    in a precomputed list of tactical positions. A negative value typically indicates
    an error or invalid state where no suitable position could be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int optimalPos = hunter.GetOptimalPosition();\nif (optimalPos >= 0) {\n\
      \    // Move to the calculated optimal position\n    player->MoveTo(optimalPos);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error case - no valid position found\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      AI\", \"Failed to calculate optimal position for hunter\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SurvivalHunterRefactored AI module and assumes
    that the hunter's current state, target information, and environment data are
    already updated. The actual positioning logic may involve complex pathfinding
    algorithms and threat assessment calculations.
  warnings: The method might return a negative value if the hunter is in an invalid
    state or if no safe position can be determined within the defined tactical constraints.
    Always validate the return value before using it for movement decisions.
