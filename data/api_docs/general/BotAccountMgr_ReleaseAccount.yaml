  method: ReleaseAccount
  signature: void BotAccountMgr::ReleaseAccount(uint32 bnetAccountId)
documentation:
  brief: Releases a Battle.net account from bot management, freeing it for use by
    other systems or players.
  description: The ReleaseAccount method removes the specified Battle.net account
    from the bot management system's control. This action typically unbinds the account
    from any active bot operations and makes it available for normal gameplay or reassignment.
    The method likely updates internal tracking structures to mark the account as
    released, potentially clearing associated bot data or flags. It is designed to
    be called when a bot session ends or when an account needs to be returned to regular
    player usage.
  parameters:
  - name: bnetAccountId
    description: The unique identifier of the Battle.net account to be released from
      bot management. This value typically corresponds to the account's numeric ID
      used within the TrinityCore database and authentication systems.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Account Release
    code: BotAccountMgr::Instance()->ReleaseAccount(123456789);
    language: cpp
  - title: Releasing Account in Bot Cleanup Routine
    code: "void CleanupBotSession(uint32 accountId)\n{\n    BotAccountMgr::Instance()->ReleaseAccount(accountId);\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot management system that tracks
    account usage and ensures proper resource allocation. The release operation may
    involve database updates, memory cleanup, or state transitions within the bot
    manager's internal data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already released account may result in undefined
    behavior or errors. Ensure that the account is currently managed by the bot system
    before calling ReleaseAccount to avoid potential issues with account state consistency.
