  method: GetSwapDistance
  signature: float TankPositioning::GetSwapDistance() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the distance threshold used for swapping tank positions in combat.
  description: The GetSwapDistance method retrieves the float value representing the
    minimum distance threshold at which a tank will swap positions with another unit
    during combat. This value is typically used in AI behavior systems to determine
    when a tank should reposition itself relative to its target or other units. The
    returned distance is measured in yards and is configurable based on the specific
    tank type, encounter mechanics, or difficulty settings. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the distance threshold (in yards) used for tank
    positioning swaps. This value is typically positive and defines how close a unit
    must be before a swap occurs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float swapDistance = tankPositioning->GetSwapDistance();\nif (swapDistance\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the swap distance for positioning logic\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Swap distance: \" << swapDistance << \" yards\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void CheckTankSwap()\n{\n    float currentDistance = GetDistanceToTarget();\n\
      \    float swapThreshold = tankPositioning->GetSwapDistance();\n    \n    if\
      \ (currentDistance <= swapThreshold)\n    {\n        // Initiate tank swap logic\n\
      \        PerformTankSwap();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making processes in combat
    scenarios. The value returned may vary depending on the creature's type, difficulty
    level, or specific encounter design. It's recommended to cache this value if it's
    accessed frequently during performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned distance value is properly validated before use,
    as negative values could indicate invalid configuration or unexpected behavior
    in the AI system. This method should not be used for real-time distance calculations
    but rather as a static threshold parameter.
