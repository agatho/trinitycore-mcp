  class: KitingManager
  method: IsInAttackWindow
  signature: bool KitingManager::IsInAttackWindow()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is within the optimal attack window for kiting
    mechanics.
  description: The IsInAttackWindow method evaluates if the current player's position
    and movement state align with the game's kiting mechanics, specifically checking
    if the player is in a valid range and orientation to perform an effective attack
    without breaking their kiting strategy. This method is crucial for AI behavior
    and player movement logic in combat scenarios where maintaining distance while
    attacking is important. The check considers factors such as target distance, angle,
    and movement speed to determine if the attack can be executed safely within the
    defined kiting window.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently within the optimal attack window
    for kiting mechanics; otherwise returns false when the player's position or movement
    would disrupt effective kiting behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (kitingManager.IsInAttackWindow()) {\n    // Perform attack action\n\
      \    player->Attack(target);\n} else {\n    // Move closer or adjust position\n\
      \    player->MoveTowards(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other kiting-related functions
    to maintain proper combat positioning. It may be called frequently during combat
    updates, so performance considerations should be taken into account for high-frequency
    checks.
