  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleModMovementForceMagnitude
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleModMovementForceMagnitude(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the magnitude of movement force effects applied to an aura application.
  description: The HandleModMovementForceMagnitude method adjusts the strength or
    intensity of movement force modifications associated with a specific aura effect.
    This function is typically invoked during aura application or removal to modify
    how movement-related mechanics are affected by the aura. It operates on the provided
    AuraApplication instance and applies changes based on whether the aura is being
    applied or removed, as indicated by the 'apply' parameter. The method influences
    player or creature movement behavior in response to magical effects that alter
    movement force.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura application
      context. This parameter specifies which aura's movement force magnitude should
      be modified.
  - name: mode
    description: Unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the mode of operation for the aura
      effect handling. This value determines how the modification is applied, such
      as whether it's additive or multiplicative.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura is being applied (true)
      or removed (false). This controls the direction of the magnitude change for
      movement force effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Movement Force Magnitude Modification
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = aura->GetEffect(0);

      effect->HandleModMovementForceMagnitude(auraApp, 1, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Movement Force Magnitude Effect
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = aura->GetEffect(0);

      effect->HandleModMovementForceMagnitude(auraApp, 2, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura effect handling system in TrinityCore and
    interacts with movement mechanics. It should only be called from within the aura
    application lifecycle, typically during aura application or removal events. The
    'mode' parameter may vary depending on implementation specifics and can affect
    how the magnitude is calculated.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the 'apply' flag can lead to unexpected movement behavior
    changes. Ensure that this method is not invoked outside of proper aura application
    contexts to prevent undefined behavior or exploits.
