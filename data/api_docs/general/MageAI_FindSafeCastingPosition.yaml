  class: MageAI
  method: FindSafeCastingPosition
  signature: void MageAI::FindSafeCastingPosition()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and sets a safe casting position for the MageAI to avoid harmful
    effects or terrain hazards during spellcasting.
  description: The FindSafeCastingPosition method determines an optimal location for
    a mage AI character to cast spells without being interrupted by environmental
    hazards, enemy proximity, or other detrimental conditions. This method evaluates
    the current environment and positioning of the AI to ensure that spell casting
    occurs at a location that minimizes risk of interruption or damage. It is typically
    invoked before initiating any spellcasting sequence to prepare the AI's position
    for safe execution of magical abilities. The method modifies internal state variables
    within the MageAI class to store the calculated safe position, which can then
    be used by other methods in the casting logic.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyMageAI::OnSpellCast()\n{\n    FindSafeCastingPosition();\n    //\
      \ Proceed with spell casting using the calculated safe position\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations involving distance to enemies, terrain
    height, line of sight checks, and spell effect radius. It may also consider the
    AI's current health status and mana levels when determining optimal positioning.
  warnings: The method assumes that the MageAI has access to up-to-date information
    about its surroundings. If the environment changes rapidly during execution, the
    calculated safe position might become invalid.
