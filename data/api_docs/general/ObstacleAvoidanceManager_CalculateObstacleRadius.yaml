  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: CalculateObstacleRadius
  signature: float ObstacleAvoidanceManager::CalculateObstacleRadius(WorldObject *
    object, ObstacleType type)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the obstacle radius for a given object based on its
    type.
  description: The CalculateObstacleRadius method determines the effective radius
    that an object should use when avoiding obstacles in the game world. This radius
    is crucial for pathfinding and movement calculations, ensuring that creatures
    and players maintain appropriate distances from environmental hazards, other units,
    and interactive objects. The method takes into account the type of obstacle and
    the properties of the provided WorldObject to compute a suitable avoidance radius.
    It's typically used internally by the AI and movement systems to prevent collisions
    and ensure realistic navigation behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject for which to calculate the obstacle radius.
      This can be a player, creature, or any other object in the game world that requires
      obstacle avoidance calculations.
  - name: type
    description: The type of obstacle being considered. This enum determines how the
      radius is calculated and what factors are taken into account for different obstacle
      categories.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated obstacle radius in world
    units. A larger radius indicates a greater need for avoidance, while a smaller
    radius suggests less interference with movement paths.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get obstacle radius for a creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      float radius = obstacleManager->CalculateObstacleRadius(creature, ObstacleType::WALL);

      // Use the calculated radius for pathfinding or movement logic'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the method in AI behavior to adjust movement
    code: "if (obstacleManager->CalculateObstacleRadius(player, ObstacleType::MOB)\
      \ > 5.0f)\n{\n    // Adjust pathfinding or movement strategy for high-obstacle\
      \ areas\n    ai->SetMovementSpeed(MovementSpeed::SLOW);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or optimized for performance since it may be
    called frequently during AI updates and pathfinding operations. The actual implementation
    details depend on the specific obstacle types defined in the game and how they
    interact with the object's physical properties.
  warnings: Ensure that the WorldObject pointer passed to this method is valid and
    not null, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause a crash. Also, be aware
    that different ObstacleType values may produce significantly different results,
    so use appropriate type checking or default handling in your code.
