  signature: bool Unit::UpdatePosition(const int & pos, bool teleport)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the position of a unit in the game world, optionally teleporting
    it to a new location.
  description: The UpdatePosition method is used to modify the current position of
    a Unit object within the TrinityCore game world. This method can either move the
    unit smoothly over time or teleport it instantly to a new location depending on
    the teleport parameter. When teleport is set to true, the unit's position is immediately
    updated without any movement animation. The method returns true if the position
    update was successful and false otherwise. This functionality is commonly used
    for player movement, NPC relocation, or object positioning during game events.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the new position coordinate.
      In TrinityCore, this typically refers to a position index or coordinate value
      within the game world's coordinate system.
  - name: teleport
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to teleport the unit (true) or move
      it smoothly (false). When true, the unit is instantly relocated without animation.
      When false, movement animations may be applied.
  returns: Returns true if the position update was successful and the unit's position
    was updated in the game world. Returns false if the update failed due to invalid
    parameters, world boundaries, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Teleport a unit to a new location
    code: "Unit* player = ...;\nint newPosition = 12345;\nbool success = player->UpdatePosition(newPosition,\
      \ true);\nif (success) {\n    // Unit has been teleported successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Smoothly move a unit to a new location
    code: "Unit* npc = ...;\nint targetPosition = 67890;\nbool success = npc->UpdatePosition(targetPosition,\
      \ false);\nif (success) {\n    // Unit will move smoothly to the new position\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts with TrinityCore's movement system and may trigger
    various game events such as zone updates or visibility changes. The 'pos' parameter
    should be validated against valid world coordinates to prevent errors. When teleporting,
    the method bypasses normal movement checks and collision detection.
  warnings: Using this method with invalid position values can cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate input parameters before calling UpdatePosition. Be
    cautious when teleporting units during combat as it may affect combat state or
    positioning logic.
