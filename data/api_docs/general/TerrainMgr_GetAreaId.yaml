api:
  class: TerrainMgr
  method: GetAreaId
  signature: uint32 TerrainMgr::GetAreaId(const PhaseShift & phaseShift, const int
    & loc)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the area ID associated with a given phase shift and location within
    the terrain.
  description: The GetAreaId method is used to determine the area identifier (ID)
    of a specific location in the game world based on the provided PhaseShift and
    location coordinates. This method plays a crucial role in World of Warcraft's
    phase system, where different areas may be visible or hidden depending on player
    progression, events, or quests. The method takes into account both the current
    phase state of the world and the exact position of the entity (such as a player
    or NPC) to accurately return the corresponding area ID. It is commonly used for
    determining zone-specific behaviors, quest triggers, or visibility checks in phased
    environments.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: A reference to a PhaseShift object that defines the current phase
      state of the world or entity. This includes information about which phases are
      active and how they affect visibility.
  - name: loc
    description: An integer representing the location identifier or index within the
      terrain system. This typically corresponds to a specific point or region in
      the game world's coordinate space.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value that represents the unique area ID of the specified
    location under the given phase shift. If no valid area is found, it may return
    0, indicating an invalid or unknown area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 areaId = TerrainMgr::Instance()->GetAreaId(player->GetPhaseShift(),
      player->GetPosition().x);

      // Returns the area ID at the player''s current X coordinate under their active
      phase.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Phase Check
    code: "PhaseShift phase = player->GetPhaseShift();\nuint32 areaId = TerrainMgr::Instance()->GetAreaId(phase,\
      \ 100);\nif (areaId != 0)\n{\n    // Process logic based on the area ID\n  \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Player is in area: %u\", areaId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid area ID returned for location 100\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal terrain data structures and phase mapping.
    It should be called only when valid PhaseShift and location data are available
    to avoid undefined behavior. The method may perform lookup operations in a spatial
    index or grid-based system for performance reasons.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized PhaseShift object
    can lead to incorrect results or crashes. Ensure that the phase shift is properly
    initialized before calling this method. Also, make sure that the location parameter
    corresponds to a valid terrain coordinate within the game world.
