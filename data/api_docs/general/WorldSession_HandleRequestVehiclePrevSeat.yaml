    & requestVehiclePrevSeat)
documentation:
  brief: Handles a client request to switch to the previous vehicle seat.
  description: This method processes a packet sent by the client when a player attempts
    to move to the previous seat in a vehicle they are currently occupying. It is
    part of the vehicle seat management system in TrinityCore, allowing players to
    navigate between available seats on vehicles such as mounts or transport vehicles.
    The method validates the request and updates the player's vehicle seat accordingly.
    This functionality supports the game mechanics where players can switch between
    different seating positions within a vehicle, which may affect abilities, camera
    view, or interaction with the vehicle.

  - title: Basic Usage in Session Handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestVehiclePrevSeat(WorldPackets::Vehicle::RequestVehiclePrevSeat&\
      \ requestVehiclePrevSeat)\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n\
      \        if (Unit* vehicle = player->GetVehicleBase())\n        {\n        \
      \    player->ChangeSeat(-1); // Switch to previous seat\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the packet handling system in
    WorldSession. It relies on the player's current vehicle state and seat position.
    The implementation assumes that the client has already validated basic conditions
    such as vehicle occupancy and seat availability.
  warnings: Improper handling of vehicle seat changes can lead to desynchronization
    between client and server states, potentially causing visual glitches or invalid
    interactions with the vehicle. Ensure proper validation before changing seats.
