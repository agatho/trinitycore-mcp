documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BuyerItemInfo object with default values.
  description: The BuyerItemInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the BuyerItemInfo
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the object, typically initializing
    member variables to their default values or null states. In the context of TrinityCore's
    auction house system, this constructor would be called when creating new buyer
    item information records, which track items that players have expressed interest
    in purchasing. The initialization ensures that all data members are properly set
    before the object is used in auction house operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BuyerItemInfo instance
    code: 'BuyerItemInfo buyerInfo;

      // This creates a new BuyerItemInfo object with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using BuyerItemInfo in auction house context
    code: "void ProcessAuctionBid(Player* player, uint32 itemId) {\n    BuyerItemInfo\
      \ buyerInfo;\n    // Initialize buyer info for tracking bid interest\n    buyerInfo.SetItemId(itemId);\n\
      \    buyerInfo.SetBuyerGuid(player->GetGUID());\n    // Further processing of\
      \ auction bid...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when declaring a BuyerItemInfo
    variable on the stack. Developers should be aware that member variables are initialized
    to their default values (0, nullptr, false, etc.) rather than specific meaningful
    values. The object remains in an uninitialized state until explicitly populated
    with data.
  warnings: When using BuyerItemInfo objects in multi-threaded environments, ensure
    proper synchronization as the constructor itself doesn't guarantee thread safety
    of subsequent member operations. Also, be cautious about stack allocation of large
    objects which may cause stack overflow issues in high-frequency scenarios.
