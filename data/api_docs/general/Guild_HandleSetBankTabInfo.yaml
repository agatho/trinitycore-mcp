  signature: void Guild::HandleSetBankTabInfo(WorldSession * session, uint8 tabId,
    std::string_view name, std::string_view icon)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the name and icon of a specified guild bank tab.
  description: The HandleSetBankTabInfo method is responsible for modifying the properties
    of a guild bank tab, specifically its name and icon. This method is typically
    invoked when a guild leader or officer attempts to customize the appearance of
    a bank tab through in-game UI interactions. It ensures that changes are properly
    validated and propagated within the guild's banking system. The method operates
    on a per-tab basis, allowing for individual customization of each tab's metadata.
    This functionality supports the guild's organizational structure by enabling members
    to quickly identify different categories of items stored in the guild bank.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the player's active
      connection to the server.
  - name: tabId
    description: The index identifier of the guild bank tab to be modified (0-based).
      Must be a valid tab index within the guild's current bank configuration.
  - name: name
    description: The new name to assign to the specified bank tab. Should not exceed
      the maximum allowed length for bank tab names.
  - name: icon
    description: The new icon identifier or path to assign to the specified bank tab.
      Must represent a valid icon resource recognized by the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Guild Bank Tab Name and Icon
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->HandleSetBankTabInfo(session,\
      \ 0, \"Weapons\", \"INV_Sword_07\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs validation checks to ensure that the tabId is
    within valid bounds and that the name/icon values are acceptable. It may also
    trigger a broadcast update to all guild members to synchronize the changes across
    clients.
  warnings: Improper handling of tabId or invalid icon names could lead to client-side
    display issues or server-side errors. Ensure that the tab index corresponds to
    an existing bank tab before calling this method.
