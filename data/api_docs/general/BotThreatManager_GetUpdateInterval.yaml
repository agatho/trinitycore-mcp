  class: BotThreatManager
  method: GetUpdateInterval
  signature: uint32 BotThreatManager::GetUpdateInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update interval in milliseconds used by the bot threat manager
    for threat calculations.
  description: The GetUpdateInterval method retrieves the time interval, measured
    in milliseconds, at which the BotThreatManager performs threat updates for AI-controlled
    bots. This interval determines how frequently the threat system recalculates and
    adjusts the bot's target selection based on current combat conditions. The value
    is typically configured through server settings or hardcoded defaults within the
    TrinityCore framework. Understanding this interval is crucial for developers working
    with bot AI behavior, as it directly affects responsiveness and performance of
    threat management systems in player versus environment (PvE) scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the update interval in milliseconds. This indicates
    how often the threat manager refreshes its internal threat calculations for bots.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 interval = botThreatManager->GetUpdateInterval();

      printf("Bot threat update interval: %u ms\n", interval);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned value may vary depending on the specific configuration of the
    TrinityCore server instance. This method is typically called during initialization
    or when monitoring bot AI performance to ensure optimal threat management behavior.
