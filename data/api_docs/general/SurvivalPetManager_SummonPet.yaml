  brief: Summons a survival pet for the player character.
  description: The SummonPet method is responsible for creating and summoning a survival
    pet associated with the player. This method typically handles the logic required
    to spawn the pet in the game world, including setting up the pet's properties,
    linking it to the owner, and ensuring proper positioning relative to the player.
    It may also manage any necessary cooldowns or resource requirements before allowing
    the pet to be summoned. The exact behavior can vary depending on the specific
    implementation within the TrinityCore framework and the player's current class
    or abilities.
