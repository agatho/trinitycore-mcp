api:
  class: InteractionManager
  method: SmartBank
  signature: bool InteractionManager::SmartBank(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Performs smart banking operations for a player bot, handling item deposit
    and withdrawal based on predefined rules.
  description: The SmartBank method in the InteractionManager class automates the
    process of managing a player bot's inventory by intelligently depositing and withdrawing
    items from the bank. It evaluates the bot's current inventory, compares it against
    configured banking rules, and executes appropriate banking actions to optimize
    item storage and retrieval. This method typically handles mundane tasks like selling
    unwanted items, storing valuable equipment, and withdrawing necessary consumables
    or tools. The implementation likely checks for item durability, stack limits,
    and player gold availability before performing any banking operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the banking operation was successfully completed without
    errors, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate issues such as insufficient
    bank space, invalid item references, or failed transaction processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic SmartBank Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player\nbool success = sInteractionManager->SmartBank(bot);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Banking operation completed successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Smart banking completed for bot.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle failure case\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to perform smart banking for bot.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated bot management system and should be
    called periodically or when specific conditions are met. The actual behavior depends
    heavily on the configuration settings defined in the bot's profile, including
    banking rules, item priorities, and storage thresholds. It may involve database
    operations for tracking item states and player gold balances.
  warnings: This method modifies the player bot's inventory and bank state directly.
    Improper implementation or misconfiguration could lead to loss of items or inconsistent
    game state. Ensure that all preconditions are met before calling this method,
    particularly regarding the validity of the Player pointer and the presence of
    a valid bank location nearby.
