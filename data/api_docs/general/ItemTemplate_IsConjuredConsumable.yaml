documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item template represents a conjured consumable.
  description: The IsConjuredConsumable method checks if an ItemTemplate object represents
    a conjoined consumable item. In World of Warcraft, conjured items are those created
    by spells like 'Conjure Food' or 'Conjure Water', which have specific properties
    and behaviors distinct from regular items. This method returns true if the item
    template is flagged as a conjured consumable, typically used for game mechanics
    such as determining whether an item can be consumed instantly or has special duration
    behavior. The check is performed against internal flags set during item creation
    or loading.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item template represents a conjoined consumable; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is a conjured consumable
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate\
      \ && itemTemplate->IsConjuredConsumable()) {\n    // Handle conjured consumable\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"This item is a conjured consumable.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags within the ItemTemplate structure that
    are typically set based on the item's entry in the database or through spell effects.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with item usage logic to determine special behavior
    for conjured items.
