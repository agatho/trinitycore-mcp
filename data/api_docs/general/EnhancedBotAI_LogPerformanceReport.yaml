documentation:
  brief: Logs a performance report for the enhanced bot AI system
  description: The LogPerformanceReport method generates and outputs detailed performance
    metrics for the EnhancedBotAI system. This includes timing data, resource usage
    statistics, and operational efficiency measurements. The method is typically invoked
    during bot behavior analysis or debugging sessions to identify potential performance
    bottlenecks. It may also be triggered automatically at regular intervals or upon
    specific game events to monitor AI performance. The generated report helps developers
    optimize bot behavior and ensure smooth gameplay experiences.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EnhancedBotAI* botAI = ...;

      botAI->LogPerformanceReport();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Performance Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorBotPerformance(EnhancedBotAI& botAI) {\n    // Perform some\
      \ AI operations\n    botAI.Update();\n    \n    // Log performance after operation\n\
      \    botAI.LogPerformanceReport();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal timing mechanisms to measure execution duration
    of various AI subsystems. The output is typically directed to the game's logging
    system or console for debugging purposes. It may include memory allocation statistics
    and CPU usage data.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently during gameplay may impact performance.
    It should primarily be used in development environments or during controlled testing
    scenarios rather than production gameplay.
