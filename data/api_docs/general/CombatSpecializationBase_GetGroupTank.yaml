  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: GetGroupTank
  signature: Player * CombatSpecializationBase::GetGroupTank() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Player object representing the group's designated tank.
  description: The GetGroupTank method retrieves the Player object that is currently
    designated as the tank within the player's group. This designation is typically
    managed by the game's group management system and may be updated based on role
    assignments, combat situations, or player actions. The returned Player pointer
    can be used to access tank-specific properties, perform group-based actions, or
    determine the current tank for targeting purposes. If no player is designated
    as tank or if the player is not in a group, this method returns nullptr.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object who is currently designated as the group's
    tank, or nullptr if no tank is assigned or the player is not in a group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for group tank
    code: "Player* tank = combatSpecBase->GetGroupTank();\nif (tank != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Perform actions specific to the tank\n    sLog->outString(\"Current\
      \ tank is: %s\", tank->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      No designated tank in group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal group management system of TrinityCore
    and may return different values depending on the current state of the group roles.
    The returned Player pointer is only valid for the duration of the current game
    tick unless additional reference counting or ownership is implemented.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned Player object will remain valid beyond
    the current execution context. Always check for nullptr before dereferencing the
    returned pointer to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
