  class: CooldownManager
  method: GetSpellsOnCooldownCount
  signature: uint32 CooldownManager::GetSpellsOnCooldownCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of spells currently on cooldown within the manager.
  description: The GetSpellsOnCooldownCount method retrieves the number of spells
    that are currently in a cooldown state within the CooldownManager. This count
    includes all spells that have been activated and are waiting to be available for
    use again. The method is typically used by game systems to track spell availability,
    enforce cooldown rules, and manage player actions. It provides a quick way to
    determine how many abilities are currently restricted due to cooldowns without
    needing to iterate through individual spell entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of spells currently on cooldown
    in the manager. Returns 0 if no spells are on cooldown.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 cooldownCount = player->GetCooldownManager()->GetSpellsOnCooldownCount();\n\
      if (cooldownCount > 0)\n{\n    // Player has spells on cooldown\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player has %u spells on cooldown.\", cooldownCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Cooldown Management Check
    code: "void CheckSpellAvailability(Player* player)\n{\n    CooldownManager* cooldownMgr\
      \ = player->GetCooldownManager();\n    uint32 activeCooldowns = cooldownMgr->GetSpellsOnCooldownCount();\n\
      \    \n    if (activeCooldowns == 0)\n    {\n        // All spells available\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"All spells are available for use.\");\n    }\n  \
      \  else\n    {\n        // Some spells are on cooldown\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      %u spells currently on cooldown.\", activeCooldowns);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation and is generally fast. It does
    not modify any internal state or trigger side effects. The returned value reflects
    the current state of the cooldown manager at the time of the call, which may change
    immediately after the method returns if other systems are modifying cooldowns.
  warnings: The returned count only represents spells currently in cooldown and does
    not include passive abilities or effects that might restrict spell usage. Be aware
    that calling this method during cooldown updates or spell activation may return
    inconsistent values if the internal state changes between calls.
