  class: GatheringManager
  method: OnInitialize
  signature: bool GatheringManager::OnInitialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the gathering manager system and prepares it for handling resource
    collection operations.
  description: The OnInitialize method is responsible for setting up the GatheringManager
    class during the server startup or module initialization phase. This method performs
    essential setup tasks such as registering event handlers, initializing internal
    data structures, loading configuration settings, and preparing the system to handle
    player gathering activities like mining, herbalism, and skinning. It ensures that
    all necessary components are ready before the manager begins processing gathering
    requests from players. The method returns true if initialization is successful,
    or false if any critical setup fails.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the gathering manager was successfully initialized with
    all required components and systems ready for operation; returns false if initialization
    failed due to missing dependencies, configuration errors, or system resource issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: "GatheringManager* manager = new GatheringManager();\nbool success = manager->OnInitialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Manager is ready for use\n    sLog->outString(\"Gathering\
      \ manager initialized successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize gathering manager.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the module's lifecycle. It
    is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework during server
    startup, but can also be manually called in custom initialization sequences. The
    method performs blocking operations that may impact startup time if extensive
    data loading or validation is required.
  warnings: Do not call this method multiple times without proper cleanup between
    calls as it may lead to resource leaks or inconsistent internal state. Avoid calling
    OnInitialize after the manager has already been initialized and is actively processing
    gathering requests.
