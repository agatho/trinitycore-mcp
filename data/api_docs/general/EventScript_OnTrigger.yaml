  class: EventScript
  method: OnTrigger
  signature: void EventScript::OnTrigger(WorldObject * object, WorldObject * invoker,
    uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Executes custom script logic when an event is triggered by a WorldObject
    in the game world.
  description: The OnTrigger method is a virtual callback function that gets invoked
    whenever a specific event is activated within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method allows developers to implement custom behavior or actions when certain
    conditions are met, such as player interactions with game objects, area triggers,
    or other scripted events. It serves as the core mechanism for attaching functional
    logic to events in the game's AI and scripting system. The method receives information
    about the object that triggered the event and the invoker (if applicable), enabling
    precise control over how different entities respond to events.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that triggered the event. This can be
      a player, creature, game object, or any other type of world entity that initiates
      the event.
  - name: invoker
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that invoked or caused the event to occur.
      May be nullptr if no specific invoker exists, or may point to the same object
      as 'object' in some cases.
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific event being triggered. Used to
      distinguish between different types of events and route execution accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Trigger Implementation
    code: "class MyEventScript : public EventScript {\npublic:\n    void OnTrigger(WorldObject*\
      \ object, WorldObject* invoker, uint32 eventId) override {\n        if (eventId\
      \ == 1001) {\n            // Handle event 1001\n            object->Say(\"Event\
      \ triggered!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Event Trigger with Conditional Logic
    code: "class QuestTriggerScript : public EventScript {\npublic:\n    void OnTrigger(WorldObject*\
      \ object, WorldObject* invoker, uint32 eventId) override {\n        if (!object\
      \ || !invoker)\n            return;\n\n        if (Player* player = object->ToPlayer())\
      \ {\n            if (eventId == 5001 && player->GetQuestStatus(12345) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\
      \ {\n                player->AddQuestReward(12345);\n                player->SendDirectMessage(\"\
      Quest completed!\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the EventScript base class and must be overridden in
    derived classes to provide custom functionality. Ensure that all pointers are
    validated before use, as they may be null. The eventId parameter allows for efficient
    routing of multiple event types within a single script instance.
  warnings: Never assume that either 'object' or 'invoker' will not be nullptr; always
    perform null checks. Be cautious with long-running operations inside this method
    as it's called synchronously during the game loop and can affect performance if
    blocking operations are performed.
