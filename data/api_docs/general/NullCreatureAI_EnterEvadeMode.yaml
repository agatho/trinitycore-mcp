  signature: void NullCreatureAI::EnterEvadeMode(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Places the creature into evade mode, causing it to return to its initial
    position and orientation.
  description: The EnterEvadeMode method is used to trigger the creature's evade behavior
    in TrinityCore. When invoked, this method causes the creature to stop attacking,
    clear its current target, and move back to its original spawn position and orientation.
    This is typically called when a creature's AI detects that it has lost its target
    or when combat conditions are no longer valid. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no direct actions beyond initiating the evade sequence. It is part
    of the NullCreatureAI class, which serves as a base implementation for creatures
    that do not require complex AI behavior.

    code: "void MyCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim() &&\
      \ !me->GetVictim()->IsAlive())\n    {\n        me->AI()->EnterEvadeMode();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core AI system when certain
    conditions are met, such as losing a target or exceeding combat distance. It does
    not perform any immediate movement; instead, it sets up the creature to begin
    evading on the next update cycle.
