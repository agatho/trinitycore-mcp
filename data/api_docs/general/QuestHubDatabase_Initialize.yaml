  class: QuestHubDatabase
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool QuestHubDatabase::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the QuestHub database connection and verifies its readiness for
    use.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the database connection for the QuestHub
    system, establishing necessary connections to the TrinityCore database backend.
    It performs essential setup operations such as validating database credentials,
    checking connection integrity, and preparing required tables or structures. This
    method must be called before any other QuestHubDatabase operations to ensure proper
    functionality. The initialization process includes verifying that the database
    is accessible and that all required schema elements are present and correctly
    configured.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the database connection was successfully initialized and
    validated; returns false if the initialization failed due to connection issues,
    authentication problems, or missing database components.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "QuestHubDatabase questHubDb;\nbool success = questHubDb.Initialize();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Database is ready for use\n    printf(\"QuestHub database\
      \ initialized successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to initialize QuestHub database\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during application startup. Reinitialization
    attempts may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method performs
    blocking operations and may take several seconds to complete depending on database
    response times.
  warnings: Do not call this method from multiple threads simultaneously as it may
    cause race conditions. Ensure that all database configuration parameters are correctly
    set before invoking this method.
