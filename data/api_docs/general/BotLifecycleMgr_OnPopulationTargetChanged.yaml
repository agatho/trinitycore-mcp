  class: BotLifecycleMgr
  method: OnPopulationTargetChanged
  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::OnPopulationTargetChanged(uint32 zoneId, uint32
    targetPopulation)
documentation:
  brief: Updates bot population targeting for a specified zone when the target population
    changes.
  description: The OnPopulationTargetChanged method is invoked to notify the BotLifecycleMgr
    that the desired population target for bots in a specific zone has been modified.
    This method likely triggers internal logic to adjust bot spawning, despawning,
    or behavior to align with the new target population. It serves as part of the
    dynamic bot management system within TrinityCore's AI framework, allowing administrators
    or game systems to modify how many bots should exist in a given area. The method
    does not return any value and is typically called in response to configuration
    changes or zone-specific events.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone for which the bot population target
      has changed. This ID corresponds to a specific area in the game world.
  - name: targetPopulation
    description: The new desired number of bots that should be present in the specified
      zone. This value determines how many bots will be spawned or adjusted to meet
      the target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Bot Population Target for a Zone
    code: '/* Example of calling OnPopulationTargetChanged */

      uint32 zoneId = 1234;

      uint32 newTarget = 50;

      botLifecycleMgr->OnPopulationTargetChanged(zoneId, newTarget);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other bot lifecycle management
    functions to dynamically control the number of bots in a zone. It may be called
    from game commands, configuration updates, or event-driven systems that modify
    bot behavior.
