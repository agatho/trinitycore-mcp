documentation:
  brief: Loads guild event data for the specified guild identifier.
  description: The LoadGuildEventData method retrieves and initializes all relevant
    event-related information for a given guild from the database. This includes guild
    events, their schedules, participants, and associated metadata. The method is
    typically invoked during guild initialization or when event data needs to be refreshed
    in memory. It ensures that all event-related functionality for the guild is properly
    set up and accessible for subsequent operations such as event scheduling, participation
    tracking, or notification handling.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild whose event data needs to be loaded.
      Must correspond to a valid guild entry in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Load Event Data for a Specific Guild
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 myGuildId = 12345;

      coordinator.LoadGuildEventData(myGuildId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called during guild loading phases or when
    event data becomes stale. It may perform database queries and should not be invoked
    frequently in performance-critical sections of code.
