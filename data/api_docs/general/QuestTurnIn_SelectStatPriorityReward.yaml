  signature: uint32 QuestTurnIn::SelectStatPriorityReward(const int & rewards, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the most beneficial stat priority reward for a bot player based on
    quest rewards.
  description: The SelectStatPriorityReward method determines and returns the optimal
    stat priority reward from a set of available quest rewards for a given bot player.
    This method is typically used in AI-driven quest completion logic to maximize
    the benefit of quest rewards for the bot's character progression. It evaluates
    the provided rewards and selects the one that offers the highest stat priority,
    which could be related to attributes like strength, agility, intelligence, or
    other character stats depending on the game mechanics and class-specific priorities.
    The method takes into account the player's current state and the nature of the
    rewards to make an informed selection.
  parameters:
  - name: rewards
    description: An integer reference representing the available quest rewards to
      choose from. This parameter likely encodes multiple reward options or a bitmask
      of possible rewards.
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot character for
      which the stat priority reward is being selected. This player object contains
      the necessary state and attributes to determine the optimal reward.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the identifier or index of the selected
    stat priority reward. This value corresponds to one of the possible rewards provided
    in the 'rewards' parameter, indicating which reward offers the best stat priority
    for the bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion AI
    code: 'uint32 selectedReward = questTurnIn.SelectStatPriorityReward(rewardOptions,
      botPlayer);

      // Use selectedReward to apply the chosen reward to the bot

      botPlayer->AddItem(selectedReward, 1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision making for quest rewards
    code: "int availableRewards = 0x07; // Example bitmask of 3 possible rewards\n\
      uint32 bestReward = questTurnIn.SelectStatPriorityReward(availableRewards, aiBot);\n\
      if (bestReward != 0) {\n    aiBot->CompleteQuestWithReward(bestReward);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an automated quest completion system where
    bots need to make optimal choices for reward selection. The implementation may
    consider factors such as the bot's class, current stat levels, and reward types
    to determine the best choice. It's important to note that this method assumes
    valid inputs and does not perform extensive validation.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it takes a reference to an int, which might
    be misleading if the intention is to pass a bitmask or list of rewards. Ensure
    that the 'rewards' parameter is properly formatted for the expected reward selection
    logic. Also, make sure that the bot player object passed is valid and initialized
    before calling this method.
