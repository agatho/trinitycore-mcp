  class: ThreatManager
  method: GetUnsortedThreatList
  signature: int ThreatManager::GetUnsortedThreatList() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the size of the unsorted threat list for the current ThreatManager
    instance.
  description: This method retrieves the number of entries in the unsorted threat
    list associated with the current ThreatManager. The threat list represents all
    creatures or players that have generated threat towards the entity managed by
    this ThreatManager. This count is essential for understanding the current threat
    state and can be used to determine how many targets are actively being threatened.
    The method does not modify any data but simply returns the size of the list, making
    it useful for various game mechanics operations including combat analysis and
    threat management.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the number of entries in the unsorted threat
    list, which indicates how many entities have generated threat towards the current
    entity. This count can be zero if no threat exists, or a positive integer representing
    the size of the threat list.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int threatCount = threatManager->GetUnsortedThreatList();\nif (threatCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process threat list\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other threat management
    functions to evaluate the current state of combat. It's important to note that
    this value may change during combat, as new threats can be added or removed from
    the list.
  warnings: The method does not perform any validation checks on the threat list;
    it simply returns the count. If the threat list is empty, the return value will
    be zero. Be cautious when using this in scenarios where the threat list might
    change during execution.
