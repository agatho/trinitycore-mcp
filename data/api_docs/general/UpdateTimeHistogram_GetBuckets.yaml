  class: UpdateTimeHistogram
  method: GetBuckets
  signature: int UpdateTimeHistogram::GetBuckets() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of buckets in the update time histogram.
  description: The GetBuckets method returns the total count of histogram buckets
    used to track update times within the UpdateTimeHistogram class. This histogram
    is typically employed for performance monitoring and profiling purposes, particularly
    in TrinityCore's server-side systems where tracking how long various operations
    take is crucial for maintaining optimal performance. The returned value indicates
    the fixed-size array structure that stores time measurements, allowing developers
    to analyze distribution patterns of update latencies across different subsystems
    or game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of buckets configured in the histogram.
    This value corresponds to the capacity of internal storage used for tracking update
    time measurements and remains constant after initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'UpdateTimeHistogram histogram;

      int bucketCount = histogram.GetBuckets();

      std::cout << "Histogram has " << bucketCount << " buckets" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Integration
    code: "void LogUpdatePerformance() {\n    UpdateTimeHistogram* updateHistogram\
      \ = GetUpdateHistogram();\n    int buckets = updateHistogram->GetBuckets();\n\
      \    // Use bucket count to determine histogram granularity\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      server\", \"Update histogram configured with {} buckets for performance tracking\"\
      , buckets);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other histogram methods
    like GetBucketValues() or GetTotalSamples(). The bucket count determines the resolution
    of time measurements and affects memory usage. It's important to note that this
    value is read-only and reflects the static configuration of the histogram rather
    than dynamic runtime values.
