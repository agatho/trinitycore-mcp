documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all available social events in the event bus
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a given BotAI subscriber to receive
    notifications for all social events that are currently supported by the SocialEventBus.
    This allows the bot to react to various social interactions such as friend requests,
    guild invitations, or chat messages without having to explicitly subscribe to
    each individual event type. The method returns true if the subscription was successful
    and false if it failed due to internal errors or invalid state. This is typically
    used during bot initialization or when a bot needs to become fully responsive
    to social stimuli in the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the BotAI subscriber was successfully registered for all social
    events, false otherwise. Returns false if the subscription process fails due to
    internal errors, invalid subscriber state, or if the event bus is not properly
    initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Subscription Example
    code: "BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();\nbool success = SocialEventBus::Instance()->SubscribeAll(myBot);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Bot is now subscribed to all social events\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot successfully subscribed to all social events.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to subscribe bot to social events.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally iterates through all registered social event types
    and registers the subscriber with each one. It's recommended to call this method
    early in the bot's lifecycle, preferably during initialization or when the bot
    becomes active in the game world. The method may have performance implications
    if there are many social events defined, as it performs multiple internal registrations.
  warnings: Calling SubscribeAll on an already subscribed BotAI instance might result
    in duplicate subscriptions or undefined behavior. Ensure that each BotAI instance
    is only subscribed once unless explicitly designed to handle multiple subscriptions.
    Also, be aware that this method may not work properly if the SocialEventBus singleton
    has not been initialized yet.
