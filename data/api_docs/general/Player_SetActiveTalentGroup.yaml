api:
  class: Player
  method: SetActiveTalentGroup
  signature: void Player::SetActiveTalentGroup(uint8 group)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the active talent group for the player, switching between different
    talent specializations.
  description: This method allows a player to switch their active talent group, which
    determines which set of talents is currently being used. The talent group is typically
    represented by an integer value where 0 corresponds to the first group (primary
    talents) and 1 corresponds to the second group (secondary talents). This method
    updates the player's talent specialization state and ensures that the correct
    talents are applied to the character. It also triggers a recalculation of the
    player's stats and abilities based on the new talent configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The talent group index to set as active, where 0 represents the primary
      group and 1 represents the secondary group. Valid values are 0 or 1.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Primary Talent Group
    code: player->SetActiveTalentGroup(0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Secondary Talent Group
    code: player->SetActiveTalentGroup(1);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the player's current talent
    configuration and can impact gameplay mechanics such as spell damage, attack power,
    and other stat calculations. The method may also trigger updates to the player's
    aura state and related abilities.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect talent configurations
    or unexpected behavior in gameplay mechanics. It should only be called when the
    player is in a valid state for changing talent groups (e.g., not during combat
    or in a non-player controlled state).
