  class: Player
  method: GetSharedQuestID
  signature: uint32 Player::GetSharedQuestID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the shared quest ID associated with the player's current quest state.
  description: The GetSharedQuestID method retrieves the unique identifier for a shared
    quest that is currently active or pending for the player. This identifier represents
    the specific quest instance that is shared across multiple players, typically
    in scenarios involving group quests or shared objectives. The method is commonly
    used to track quest progress and ensure proper synchronization of quest-related
    data within the game mechanics. It returns 0 when no shared quest is active or
    when the player's quest state does not contain a valid shared quest identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the shared quest ID, or 0 if no shared quest
    is currently active. The value corresponds to the unique identifier of the shared
    quest instance in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 sharedQuestId = player->GetSharedQuestID();\nif (sharedQuestId !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Process the shared quest ID\n    printf(\"Shared Quest ID: %u\\\
      n\", sharedQuestId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to maintain synchronization of shared quest data across multiple players. Performance
    considerations may arise when checking this value frequently during quest progression
    events.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in multi-threaded environments,
    as it might not always reflect the most current state of shared quests if player's
    quest state changes rapidly. Also, ensure that the returned value is not used
    directly without proper validation checks.
