  signature: void SummonList::clear()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all summons from the summon list, clearing the container of all summoned
    creatures or game objects.
  description: The SummonList::clear() method removes all entries from the summon
    list, effectively destroying or dismissing all summoned creatures or game objects
    that were tracked by this list. This operation is typically used during cleanup
    scenarios such as when a creature or player is destroyed, when a summoning effect
    expires, or when manually managing summoned entities. The method does not return
    any value and operates on the internal container of the SummonList object. It's
    important to note that calling clear() will invalidate all references to previously
    summoned units stored in this list, which may have implications for scripts or
    AI logic relying on those summon references.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing a Summon List After Creature Death
    code: "class MyCreature : public Creature\n{\npublic:\n    void OnDeath() override\n\
      \    {\n        // Clear all summons when creature dies\n        m_summonList.clear();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Summon List Management in AI Logic
    code: "class MyAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Periodically clear stale summons\n        if (m_summonList.empty())\n\
      \        {\n            m_summonList.clear();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The clear() operation is a O(n) time complexity where n is the number of
    summons in the list. It's recommended to use this method judiciously in performance-critical
    code paths. The method does not trigger any destruction callbacks or events for
    individual summoned units; it simply removes them from the tracking container.
  warnings: Using clear() on a SummonList that is actively referenced by other systems
    may lead to dangling pointers or invalid memory access if those systems attempt
    to interact with the now-cleared summons. Always ensure no external code depends
    on the summon references after calling clear().
