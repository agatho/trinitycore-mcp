  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: HandleObjectiveConflicts
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::HandleObjectiveConflicts(Group * group, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and resolves conflicts between quest objectives within a group
    context.
  description: The HandleObjectiveConflicts method manages and resolves inconsistencies
    or overlapping requirements among quest objectives for a specified quest within
    a group. This method ensures that conflicting objectives are properly handled,
    preventing duplicate progress or invalid states in the objective tracker. It is
    typically invoked when quest data changes or when group members' progress affects
    shared objectives. The method operates on a specific quest ID and objective index
    within the context of a group, adjusting internal tracking state to maintain consistency
    across all group members.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group whose quest
      objectives are being processed. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which objective conflicts are
      being resolved. Must correspond to a valid active quest in the group's tracker.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index of the specific objective within the quest that may have conflicts.
      Used to identify and process the affected objective.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest update handler
    code: "void QuestUpdateHandler::OnQuestObjectiveChanged(Group* group, uint32 questId,\
      \ uint32 objectiveIndex)\n{\n    ObjectiveTracker* tracker = group->GetObjectiveTracker();\n\
      \    if (tracker)\n        tracker->HandleObjectiveConflicts(group, questId,\
      \ objectiveIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resolving conflicts after group member joins
    code: "void GroupManager::OnMemberAdded(Group* group, Player* player)\n{\n   \
      \ if (!group || !player) return;\n    \n    // Resolve any conflicting objectives\
      \ for all active quests\n    for (auto& quest : player->GetQuestStatusMap())\n\
      \    {\n        uint32 questId = quest.first;\n        if (quest.second.m_state\
      \ & QUEST_STATE_COMPLETE)\n            continue;\n        \n        for (uint32\
      \ i = 0; i < GetObjectiveCount(questId); ++i)\n        {\n            group->GetObjectiveTracker()->HandleObjectiveConflicts(group,\
      \ questId, i);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided group is valid and contains active
    quest data. It modifies internal tracker state and may affect progress tracking
    for all group members. The method does not directly communicate with the database
    but updates in-memory objective states.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (null group, invalid questId,
    or out-of-bounds objectiveIndex) can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure
    that all inputs are validated before calling.
