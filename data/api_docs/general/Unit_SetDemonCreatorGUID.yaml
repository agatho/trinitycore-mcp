  method: SetDemonCreatorGUID
  signature: void Unit::SetDemonCreatorGUID(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the demon creator for a unit.
  description: This method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to the demon creator
    of a unit, typically used in the context of summoned creatures or pets. The GUID
    represents the entity that created or summoned the demon, such as a player or
    creature. This function is commonly used when managing summoned demons or pets
    within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, particularly for tracking ownership
    and relationships between summoned creatures and their creators.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the demon creator. This value represents
      the entity that summoned or created the demon, typically a player or creature
      GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetDemonCreatorGUID(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with player GUID
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      Player* player = new Player();

      unit->SetDemonCreatorGUID(player->GetGUID());

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other demon-related methods
    and should be called when a unit is summoned or created. The GUID value is stored
    internally and can be retrieved using related getter methods.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect ownership tracking,
    potentially causing issues with summoning mechanics or creature behavior in-game.
