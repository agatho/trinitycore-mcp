  class: PlayerbotPacketSniffer
  method: ParseGroupPacket
  signature: void PlayerbotPacketSniffer::ParseGroupPacket(WorldSession * session,
    const WorldPacket & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming group-related packets from a player session to extract
    and handle group data.
  description: The ParseGroupPacket method is responsible for analyzing and interpreting
    World of Warcraft group-related network packets received from a specific player
    session. It parses the packet contents to identify group actions such as invitations,
    joins, leaves, or updates, and then forwards this information to appropriate handlers
    within the playerbot system. This method plays a crucial role in maintaining accurate
    group state tracking for bot behavior logic. The method operates on the provided
    WorldSession and WorldPacket parameters, extracting relevant data without returning
    any value directly.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the player's active
      network connection. This session contains contextual information about the player
      and their current game state.
  - name: packet
    description: Reference to the WorldPacket object containing the raw network data
      for a group-related action. The packet structure should conform to standard
      WoW group message formats.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Packet Parsing Usage
    code: "void MyBot::HandleGroupUpdate(WorldSession* session, const WorldPacket&\
      \ packet) {\n    PlayerbotPacketSniffer sniffer;\n    sniffer.ParseGroupPacket(session,\
      \ packet);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during packet processing loops in the server's
    network handling system. It assumes that the packet data has already been validated
    and is properly formatted according to the WoW protocol. Developers should ensure
    thread safety when accessing session data concurrently.
  warnings: Improper handling of packet data can lead to incorrect group state tracking,
    which may affect bot decision-making logic. Ensure that all packet types are correctly
    identified before parsing to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
