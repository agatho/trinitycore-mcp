documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AfflictionDoTTracker class for managing
    affliction dot effects.
  description: The AfflictionDoTTracker constructor initializes a new instance of
    the AfflictionDoTTracker class, which is responsible for tracking and managing
    DoT (Damage over Time) effects related to affliction spells in World of Warcraft.
    This class likely maintains internal state about active affliction DoTs on targets,
    their durations, damage values, and other relevant properties. The constructor
    typically sets up default values for tracking variables, initializes internal
    data structures, and prepares the object for use in the combat system's effect
    management. It is designed to be used by the spell system or aura management components
    when affliction-based DoT effects are applied to targets.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AfflictionDoTTracker instance
    code: 'AfflictionDoTTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track affliction DoTs'
    language: cpp
  notes: This appears to be a constructor method, so it should only be called during
    object instantiation. The class likely requires proper initialization of its internal
    tracking structures before being used in combat scenarios. Developers should ensure
    that the tracker is properly integrated with the spell effect system and aura
    management components.
