documentation:
  brief: Clears the update mask for a Unit object, removing all update fields from
    the object's update data.
  description: The ClearUpdateMask method removes all update fields from a Unit's
    update data structure, effectively resetting the unit's update mask to its initial
    state. This method is typically used during unit initialization or when clearing
    the update mask before reassigning new update fields. The operation ensures that
    the unit's update data is properly reset and allows for fresh updates to be applied.
    In World of Warcraft context, this method is crucial for managing unit update
    states during object creation, destruction, or when updating unit properties such
    as stats, health, or movement.

      // This resets the update mask for the unit object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other update-related methods
    to manage unit state. It may be called during initialization or when resetting
    a unit's update data structure. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary
    calls during frequent updates, as this method affects the unit's update data and
    can impact memory usage.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may lead to incorrect update
    data handling. Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with
    other update methods to avoid conflicts or inconsistencies in unit update states.
