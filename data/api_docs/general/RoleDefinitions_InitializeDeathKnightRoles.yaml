documentation:
  brief: Initializes role definitions for Death Knights within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The InitializeDeathKnightRoles method sets up and configures all necessary
    role-related data structures and mappings for Death Knights in the game. This
    includes defining class-specific abilities, talent trees, and gameplay mechanics
    that are unique to the Death Knight specialization. The method ensures that all
    Death Knight roles are properly registered with the core system, enabling proper
    functionality during character creation, level-ups, and gameplay interactions.
    It is typically invoked during server initialization or when loading role definitions
    for a specific class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'RoleDefinitions roleDefs;

      roleDefs.InitializeDeathKnightRoles();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when reloading
    role definitions. It is not thread-safe and must be executed in a single-threaded
    context to prevent race conditions. The method internally handles all class-specific
    configurations for Death Knights, including ability mappings and role hierarchies.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate role registrations
    or memory leaks. Ensure that no active players are using Death Knight roles when
    invoking this method during runtime.
