documentation:
  brief: Manages the stagger level of a Monk AI unit by applying stagger effects and
    handling mitigation mechanics.
  description: The ManageStaggerLevel method is responsible for controlling the stagger
    effect on a Monk AI unit, which represents the damage mitigation mechanic unique
    to Monks in World of Warcraft. This method evaluates incoming damage, applies
    stagger stacking logic, and determines when to trigger stagger mitigation abilities
    such as Diffuse Magic or Fortifying Brew. It ensures that the Monk's stagger state
    is properly maintained throughout combat, adjusting the unit's behavior based
    on current stagger levels. The method typically runs during AI update cycles and
    interacts with the unit's health system and spell casting mechanics to provide
    appropriate stagger handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManageStaggerLevel();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the Monk AI's main update loop
    and should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom stagger behavior.
    The method relies on internal unit state tracking for stagger levels, so it must
    be called after any damage events that could affect stagger.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the AI update cycle as it may cause
    inconsistent stagger state management. Improper handling can lead to incorrect
    mitigation application or failure to trigger stagger abilities at appropriate
    thresholds.
