documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot leaves a group in the EnhancedBotAI system
  description: The OnGroupLeft method is invoked when a bot controlled by the EnhancedBotAI
    system exits a group. This method performs necessary cleanup and state management
    operations to ensure that the bot's AI behavior is properly reset or adjusted
    after leaving the group. It may handle tasks such as releasing group-related resources,
    updating internal bot state variables, and potentially triggering other AI logic
    adjustments. The method is typically called as part of the game's group management
    system when a player or bot leaves a group, ensuring that the AI system remains
    consistent with the current group composition.

  - title: Basic usage in group management
    code: "void MyBotAI::HandleGroupChange()\n{\n    // When bot leaves a group\n\
      \    OnGroupLeft();\n    // Additional logic after leaving group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the TrinityCore framework when a bot's
    group membership changes. Developers should not manually invoke this method unless
    implementing custom group handling logic. The method may be called during various
    game events such as player logout, group disbanding, or manual group leave operations.
