documentation:
  brief: Completes a seasonal quest for the player, marking it as completed and updating
    quest tracking.
  description: The SatisfyQuestSeasonal method is used to mark a seasonal quest as
    completed for the player. This method handles the necessary updates to the quest
    log and related tracking systems within the game. It ensures that the quest is
    properly marked as complete and that any associated rewards or objectives are
    handled correctly. The method typically involves checking if the quest has been
    properly completed, updating the player's quest log, and potentially triggering
    reward distribution if applicable. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods to ensure proper quest progression and completion.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that represents the seasonal quest to
      be satisfied. This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid quest
      object.
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to display quest completion messages
      to the player. If true, the method will show appropriate messages to the player;
      if false, no messages will be displayed.
  returns: Returns true if the quest was successfully satisfied and completed, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if the quest is not valid or if the player
    does not meet the requirements for completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = sQuestMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      bool result = player->SatisfyQuestSeasonal(quest, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nQuest* quest = sQuestMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (player->SatisfyQuestSeasonal(quest, false)) {\n    // Quest completed successfully\n\
      \    // Handle reward distribution or other actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player has met all requirements
    for quest completion. It is important to ensure that the quest object passed to
    this method is valid and properly initialized. The method may trigger updates
    to the player's quest log, which could affect performance if called frequently
    in rapid succession.
  warnings: The method requires that the Quest object be valid and not null. Calling
    this method with an invalid or null quest object can cause crashes or undefined
    behavior. Additionally, calling this method without proper validation of quest
    requirements may result in incomplete quest completion.
