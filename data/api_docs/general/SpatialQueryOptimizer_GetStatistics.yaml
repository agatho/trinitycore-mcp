  class: SpatialQueryOptimizer
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: OptimizerStats SpatialQueryOptimizer::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical information about the spatial query optimization process.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a structured set of performance metrics
    and operational data related to the spatial query optimization performed by the
    SpatialQueryOptimizer class. This includes information such as the number of queries
    processed, average processing time, cache hit rates, and other relevant performance
    indicators. The returned OptimizerStats object provides insights into how efficiently
    the optimizer is functioning and can be used for debugging, performance tuning,
    or monitoring purposes within the TrinityCore server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: An OptimizerStats object containing detailed statistics about the spatial
    query optimization process, including query counts, timing data, and cache performance
    metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Optimization Statistics
    code: 'SpatialQueryOptimizer optimizer;

      OptimizerStats stats = optimizer.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Queries Processed: " << stats.queryCount << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Average Time (ms): " << stats.avgProcessingTimeMs << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for performance monitoring and debugging purposes.
    The statistics returned are updated dynamically as queries are processed, making
    it suitable for real-time performance analysis. The method itself is thread-safe
    and does not modify the internal state of the optimizer.
