  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleCrowdControlBreaks(Group * group, Unit *
    target)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles crowd control breaks for group members during dungeon
    encounters.
  description: The HandleCrowdControlBreaks method is responsible for managing the
    behavior when a player or NPC in a dungeon group breaks free from crowd control
    effects. This method typically evaluates the current state of the group and target
    unit, determines if any crowd control effects are broken, and triggers appropriate
    actions such as updating the group's status, notifying the player, or modifying
    the encounter mechanics. It is commonly used in dungeon AI systems to ensure that
    players who break free from crowd control are properly handled within the context
    of the ongoing encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the dungeon group. This
      parameter defines the set of players involved in the encounter and is used to
      determine which members may be affected by crowd control breaks.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is the target of the crowd control
      effect. This unit may be a player or NPC, and the method evaluates whether this
      unit has broken free from any active crowd control effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon AI
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetTarget())\n\
      \    {\n        if (Group* group = GetPlayer()->GetGroup())\n        {\n   \
      \         HandleCrowdControlBreaks(group, target);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during dungeon encounter logic and should
    be called after checking for active crowd control effects on the target. It assumes
    that the group and target are valid and not null. The method does not directly
    remove or apply crowd control effects but rather handles the consequences of such
    effects being broken.
  warnings: Ensure that the group and target parameters are valid before calling this
    method, as passing invalid pointers may lead to undefined behavior. This method
    is part of the dungeon AI system and should only be used in contexts where group-based
    encounter logic is active.
