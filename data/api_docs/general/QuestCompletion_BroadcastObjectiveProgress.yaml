  class: QuestCompletion
  method: BroadcastObjectiveProgress
  signature: void QuestCompletion::BroadcastObjectiveProgress(Group * group, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Broadcasts progress updates for a specific quest objective to all members
    of a group.
  description: The BroadcastObjectiveProgress method sends a notification to all players
    within a specified group about the completion status of a particular quest objective.
    This functionality is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server
    implementation to synchronize quest progress across party or raid members. The
    method takes into account the quest ID and the specific objective index to determine
    what information should be broadcasted. It ensures that all group members receive
    consistent updates, which helps maintain game state synchronization and player
    engagement during cooperative gameplay activities.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will receive
      the progress update. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which objective progress is being
      broadcasted. Should correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index of the specific objective within the quest that has progressed.
      Zero-based indexing is expected.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player whose
      progress is being reported. Can be null if not applicable.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting Quest Objective Progress for a Group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    QuestCompletion::BroadcastObjectiveProgress(group,\
      \ 12345, 2, player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Bot Player Context
    code: "Group* group = bot->GetGroup();\nif (group && bot)\n{\n    QuestCompletion::BroadcastObjectiveProgress(group,\
      \ 12345, 0, bot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore's group management system and assumes
    that the provided Group pointer is valid and properly initialized. The quest ID
    and objective index must correspond to existing entries in the game's quest database.
    Performance-wise, this method may have minimal overhead as it only sends network
    packets to group members, but excessive calls could impact server performance
    during high-traffic scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, otherwise
    it will result in a crash or undefined behavior. Also, make sure that the questId
    and objectiveIndex parameters are within valid ranges to prevent accessing invalid
    memory locations.
