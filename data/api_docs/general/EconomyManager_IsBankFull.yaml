documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player's bank inventory is full
  description: The IsBankFull method determines if the player's bank tab has reached
    its maximum capacity for items. This check is essential for preventing players
    from depositing additional items when their bank is already at maximum capacity.
    The method evaluates the current number of items in the bank against the maximum
    allowed count, which varies based on the player's bank tab size and any applicable
    expansions or upgrades. It returns true if no more items can be added to the bank,
    and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's bank is at maximum capacity and cannot accept
    additional items; returns false if there is still space available in the bank.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (economyManager.IsBankFull()) {\n    // Handle bank full scenario\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Your bank is full!\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with depositing items\n    player->AddItem(itemId, quantity);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Preventing Bank Overflow
    code: "void Player::DepositItem(Item* item) {\n    if (economyManager.IsBankFull())\
      \ {\n        SendNotification(\"Cannot deposit item: Bank is full.\");\n   \
      \     return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal deposit logic\n    bank->AddItem(item);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks against the maximum number of slots available
    in the player's current bank tab. The exact capacity may vary depending on account
    upgrades, expansion status, and server configuration. This check is commonly used
    before attempting to deposit items into a player's bank to prevent errors or unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks for item capacity and does not validate
    other constraints such as item type restrictions or monetary limits. Additionally,
    in some server configurations, the bank may have different capacity rules based
    on account status or expansion level.
