  class: GroupEvent
  method: LeaderChanged
  signature: GroupEvent GroupEvent::LeaderChanged(int groupGuid, int newLeaderGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new GroupEvent instance indicating that the group leader has been
    changed.
  description: The LeaderChanged method is a static factory function within the GroupEvent
    class that constructs and returns a new GroupEvent object to represent a change
    in group leadership. This event is typically triggered when a player is promoted
    or demoted to/from the group leader role, either manually by the current leader
    or automatically due to game mechanics such as player disconnection or death.
    The returned event encapsulates the group identifier and the GUID of the new leader,
    allowing subsystems to react appropriately to leadership changes in player groups.
  parameters: []
  returns: A new GroupEvent instance representing a group leader change, containing
    the group GUID and the new leader's GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::LeaderChanged(12345, 67890);

      // event now represents a leadership change in group 12345 with new leader 67890'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be used as a static factory function and does
    not modify any existing state. It's commonly invoked by internal game systems
    when processing group leadership transitions, such as during player logout, login,
    or manual leader assignment.
