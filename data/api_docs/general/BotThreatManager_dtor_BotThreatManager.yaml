documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotThreatManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotThreatManager class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up internal data structures that track threat levels, removing any references
    to associated units or players, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. In the
    context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method ensures proper cleanup when a
    bot's threat management component is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks
    and maintaining system stability. The destructor is automatically invoked when
    the BotThreatManager object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotThreatManager
    code: 'BotThreatManager* threatManager = new BotThreatManager();

      // ... use the threat manager ...

      delete threatManager; // Triggers ~BotThreatManager()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifecycle. It is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope or are deleted. Ensure that no other components hold references
    to this object before deletion to prevent use-after-free errors.
