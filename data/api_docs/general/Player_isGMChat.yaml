  brief: Checks whether the player is using GM chat mode
  description: The isGMChat method determines if a player is currently in Game Master
    (GM) chat mode, which allows them to communicate with other players using special
    GM-only chat channels. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's scripting
    system to identify GM status and control chat behavior. When a player is in GM
    chat mode, they can send messages through the GM chat channel that others can
    see only if they are also GMs or have GM permissions. The method returns true
    when the player has enabled GM chat mode, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is using GM chat mode, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the player's chat channel is set to GM-only communication.
  examples:
  - title: Basic GM Chat Check
    code: "if (player->isGMChat()) {\n    // Player is in GM chat mode\n    // Do\
      \ something specific to GMs\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GM-related functions
    to determine player permissions and chat settings. It may be affected by the player's
    GM status, which can be set through various commands or scripting functions.
  warnings: The method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking GM
    status, as it only indicates chat mode, not full GM privileges. Be aware that
    using this method in certain contexts may affect performance if used frequently.
