documentation:
  brief: Processes and updates visible object changes for a player's field of view
  description: The Visit method in VisibleChangesNotifier is responsible for handling
    the processing of visible object changes within a player's field of view. This
    method is typically invoked during the update cycle to ensure that players see
    appropriate object visibility changes, including additions, removals, and updates
    to objects in their vicinity. It plays a crucial role in maintaining synchronization
    between the server's internal state and what the client perceives as visible entities
    in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer reference parameter that likely represents a specific
      index or identifier used internally by the visibility system to track which
      objects are being processed during the visit operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in update loop
    code: "void Player::UpdateVisibilityForWorld()\n{\n    VisibleChangesNotifier\
      \ notifier(this);\n    int index = 0;\n    notifier.Visit(index);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal visibility management system in TrinityCore
    and should not be called directly by custom modules unless implementing low-level
    visibility logic. The parameter 'param0' may be modified during execution to reflect
    the current processing state.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method without proper context or initialization
    can lead to undefined behavior or client-side visibility glitches. Ensure that
    all necessary preconditions for visibility updates are met before calling Visit.
