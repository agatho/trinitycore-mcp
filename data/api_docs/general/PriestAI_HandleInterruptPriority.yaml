  class: PriestAI
  method: HandleInterruptPriority
  signature: bool PriestAI::HandleInterruptPriority(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a target is a priority interrupt for the priest's current spell
    casting.
  description: The HandleInterruptPriority method evaluates whether the specified
    target poses a high-priority threat that requires immediate interruption of the
    priest's current spell. This method is typically used in AI decision-making to
    prioritize interrupting specific targets over others, such as when a high-level
    enemy spellcaster is about to cast a damaging or harmful ability. The method checks
    various conditions including target threat level, spell type, and priority flags
    to determine if an interrupt action should be taken immediately.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      in the AI's target list. This value is used to evaluate whether the target meets
      the criteria for high-priority interruption.
  returns: Returns true if the target is a priority interrupt, meaning the priest
    should immediately interrupt their current spell to cast a defensive or offensive
    ability on this target. Returns false if the target does not meet the interrupt
    priority criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Priority Check
    code: "if (priestAI->HandleInterruptPriority(&targetId)) {\n    // Execute immediate\
      \ interrupt spell\n    priestAI->CastInterruptSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Target List Iteration
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < targetList.size(); ++i) {\n    if (priestAI->HandleInterruptPriority(&targetList[i]))\
      \ {\n        // Prioritize interrupting this specific target\n        priestAI->InterruptCurrentSpell(targetList[i]);\n\
      \        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Priest AI's core decision-making system and should
    be called frequently during combat to maintain optimal interrupt timing. The method
    relies on internal target priority flags and threat calculations that are updated
    by the game engine.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid target in the AI's
    current target list, as invalid pointers may cause undefined behavior or incorrect
    interrupt decisions.
