  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: HandleSkittishAffix
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::HandleSkittishAffix()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the skittish affix effect for threat management in combat.
  description: The HandleSkittishAffix method manages the behavior of mobs or NPCs
    when they are affected by the 'skittish' affix, which typically causes them to
    become more erratic in their threat generation and targeting. This method is part
    of the ThreatCoordinator's functionality for handling special combat states that
    modify standard AI behavior. It likely adjusts the creature's threat table, modifies
    its aggro radius, or influences how it responds to incoming attacks or damage.
    The method is invoked during combat updates when the skittish state is active
    and may involve recalculating threat levels or triggering specific animations
    or actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void Creature::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (HasSkittishAffix())\n        m_ThreatCoordinator.HandleSkittishAffix();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during the creature's AI update cycle when a
    skittish affix effect is active. It may interact with the threat manager to modify
    how the creature processes incoming damage or threat from players.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when the skittish affix state is
    confirmed to be active, otherwise it could cause unexpected behavior in threat
    management logic.
