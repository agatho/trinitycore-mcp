documentation:
  brief: Adjusts group coordination settings based on encounter mechanics and combat
    state
  description: The AdaptToEncounterMechanics method dynamically modifies group coordination
    behavior in response to encounter-specific mechanics and combat conditions. This
    method evaluates current encounter state, player positions, and combat dynamics
    to adjust group strategies such as positioning, ability usage timing, and communication
    protocols. It ensures that group coordination adapts appropriately to the evolving
    challenges presented by different encounters, maintaining optimal performance
    and synchronization among group members during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Encounter
    code: "void MyAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Adjust group coordination when combat\
      \ begins\n    groupCoordination->AdaptToEncounterMechanics();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Encounter State Changes
    code: "void MyAI::OnEncounterPhaseChange(uint32 newPhase)\n{\n    // Re-adapt\
      \ group coordination when encounter phase changes\n    if (newPhase == PHASE_BOSS_ENRAGE)\n\
      \    {\n        groupCoordination->AdaptToEncounterMechanics();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the encounter system when
    significant combat state changes occur. It performs dynamic adjustments to group
    behavior without requiring explicit external calls in most scenarios.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method excessively during rapid state transitions as
    it may cause performance overhead. The method assumes valid group context and
    will not function properly if called outside of an active encounter.
