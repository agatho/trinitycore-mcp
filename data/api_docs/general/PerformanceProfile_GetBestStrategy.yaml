  method: GetBestStrategy
  signature: OptimizationStrategy PerformanceProfile::GetBestStrategy() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most optimal optimization strategy for performance
    profiling within the current context.
  description: The GetBestStrategy method evaluates various performance optimization
    parameters and selects the best available strategy for enhancing system efficiency.
    This method is typically used in performance-critical sections of the TrinityCore
    codebase where adaptive optimization is required. It analyzes internal profiling
    data, system resources, and contextual conditions to return an appropriate OptimizationStrategy
    enum value that represents the recommended approach for optimizing performance.
    The method does not modify any internal state but rather provides a read-only
    assessment of the optimal configuration based on current conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an OptimizationStrategy enum value representing the most suitable
    optimization approach for the current performance profile. Possible values may
    include strategies like 'None', 'Aggressive', 'Conservative', or 'Adaptive' depending
    on the implementation details of the PerformanceProfile class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PerformanceProfile profile;\nOptimizationStrategy strategy = profile.GetBestStrategy();\n\
      switch (strategy)\n{\n    case OptimizationStrategy::None:\n        // No optimization\
      \ needed\n        break;\n    case OptimizationStrategy::Aggressive:\n     \
      \   // Apply aggressive optimizations\n        break;\n    default:\n      \
      \  // Handle other strategies\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not introduce significant
    performance overhead. It's intended for use in performance-critical code paths
    where dynamic optimization decisions are needed. The returned strategy may vary
    based on runtime conditions such as CPU load, memory availability, or current
    system configuration.
