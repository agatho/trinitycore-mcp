  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: HandleGroupChat
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::HandleGroupChat(uint32 groupId, Player *
    sender, const std::string & message)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and broadcasts a group chat message from a player to all members
    of the specified group.
  description: The HandleGroupChat method is responsible for managing group communications
    within the Playerbot system. It receives a message sent by a specific player within
    a designated group and ensures that the message is properly formatted and delivered
    to all other group members. This method handles the core logic for maintaining
    group chat integrity, including validation of group membership, message filtering,
    and broadcast routing. The implementation likely integrates with TrinityCore's
    existing group management systems to ensure proper delivery and adherence to game
    rules such as permissions and communication restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the player group to which the message should
      be sent. Must correspond to an active group in the Playerbot system.
  - name: sender
    description: Pointer to the Player object who initiated the chat message. This
      player must be a member of the specified group for the message to be processed.
  - name: message
    description: The actual text content of the chat message to be broadcast. Should
      not exceed standard chat message length limits imposed by the game client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Chat Handling
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager groupMgr;

      Player* player = ...; // Valid player object

      uint32 groupId = 12345;

      std::string msg = "Hello, group!";

      groupMgr.HandleGroupChat(groupId, player, msg);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation to ensure the sender is a
    valid member of the specified group before processing. It may also integrate with
    existing TrinityCore chat handlers for consistency in message formatting and delivery.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupId corresponds to an active player group; otherwise,
    the method may silently fail or throw an exception depending on implementation.
    The sender parameter must not be null to avoid undefined behavior.
