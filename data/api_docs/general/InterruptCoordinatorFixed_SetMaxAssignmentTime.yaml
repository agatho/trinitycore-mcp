  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: SetMaxAssignmentTime
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::SetMaxAssignmentTime(uint32 timeMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum time allowed for interrupt assignment in milliseconds.
  description: The SetMaxAssignmentTime method configures the maximum duration, specified
    in milliseconds, that the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class will allow for processing
    interrupt assignments. This parameter controls how long the system waits or operates
    during interrupt handling operations, which can affect game responsiveness and
    performance. The value is typically used within the context of managing combat
    interrupts, such as when a player's action is interrupted by an external event
    like being stunned or silenced. This method does not return any value and directly
    modifies internal state.
  parameters:
  - name: timeMs
    description: The maximum time in milliseconds allowed for interrupt assignment
      processing. Valid values are positive integers representing time duration. A
      value of zero may indicate no timeout or default behavior depending on implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Assignment Time
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.SetMaxAssignmentTime(500); // Sets max time to 500ms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Timeout for Combat Interrupts
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed* interruptCoord = sObjectAccessor->GetInterruptCoordinator();

      interruptCoord->SetMaxAssignmentTime(1000); // Increase timeout to 1 second
      for complex combat scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects internal timers or state machines within the interrupt
    handling system. It should be called before starting interrupt processing to ensure
    proper behavior. The value may influence performance under high load conditions
    where many interrupts occur simultaneously.
  warnings: Setting this value too low might cause premature termination of interrupt
    assignments, leading to incomplete or failed interrupt handling. Setting it too
    high could lead to performance degradation due to extended blocking times.
