api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: SellJunkItems
  signature: InteractionResult VendorInteraction::SellJunkItems(Player * bot, Creature
    * vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Sells all junk items from the bot's inventory to the specified vendor.
  description: 'The SellJunkItems method iterates through the player''s inventory
    and identifies items that are considered ''junk'' (typically low-value or useless
    items). It then attempts to sell these items to the provided vendor creature.
    This functionality is commonly used in automated botting systems or AI-driven
    character management within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. The method
    ensures that only items meeting the junk criteria are sold, and it respects vendor
    buyback limits and item restrictions. Precondition: The player must be within
    interaction range of the vendor, and the vendor must accept the items being sold.
    Postcondition: Junk items are removed from the player''s inventory and gold is
    added to their account.'
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will sell items.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor to whom items
      are being sold.
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum indicating success or failure of the
    selling operation. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, or INCOMPLETE depending
    on whether all junk items were successfully sold.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* myBot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nInteractionResult result\
      \ = VendorInteraction::SellJunkItems(myBot, vendor);\nif (result == SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // All junk items sold successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nInteractionResult result =\
      \ VendorInteraction::SellJunkItems(bot, vendor);\nswitch (result) {\n    case\
      \ SUCCESS:\n        // Process successful sale\n        break;\n    case FAILED:\n\
      \        // Handle failed transaction\n        break;\n    case INCOMPLETE:\n\
      \        // Some items may not have been sold\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal junk item detection logic which typically
    considers item quality, level, and value. It's important to note that the vendor
    must be a valid NPC with proper sell capabilities enabled. The method may not
    process items that are soulbound or otherwise restricted from being sold.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot is within acceptable range of the vendor before calling
    this method. Calling it on an invalid vendor or when the player has no junk items
    to sell will result in minimal processing and potentially a FAILED return code.
