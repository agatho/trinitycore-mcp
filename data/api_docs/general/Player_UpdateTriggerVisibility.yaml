  signature: void Player::UpdateTriggerVisibility()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the visibility state of triggers for the player, ensuring they are
    properly shown or hidden based on game conditions.
  description: The UpdateTriggerVisibility method manages the visibility state of
    area triggers (such as quest objectives, spell triggers, or environmental effects)
    associated with the player. This method is typically invoked when the player's
    state changes, such as entering or leaving a zone, changing phases, or completing
    certain quests. It ensures that triggers are correctly displayed or hidden based
    on the player's current location, quest progress, and other relevant game conditions.
    The method operates internally by evaluating trigger conditions against the player's
    state and updating their visibility accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateTriggerVisibility();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Quest Completion Handler
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ quest completion logic\n    player->UpdateTriggerVisibility();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the core system when relevant
    player state changes occur. Developers should not usually need to call it manually
    unless implementing custom trigger visibility logic. The method may have performance
    implications if many triggers are active, as it iterates through all relevant
    triggers.
  warnings: Calling this method excessively without a clear reason can cause unnecessary
    processing overhead. It's recommended to only invoke this method when actual state
    changes occur that would affect trigger visibility.
