  class: RestMgr
  method: SetInnTrigger
  signature: void RestMgr::SetInnTrigger(int trigger)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the inn trigger ID for the RestMgr instance.
  description: The SetInnTrigger method configures the inn trigger identifier that
    is used by the RestMgr to manage player rest states and inn-related functionality
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically assigns a specific GameObject
    GUID or trigger ID that represents an inn's rest area, allowing the system to
    properly handle player resting, resurrection points, and related game mechanics.
    The method does not validate the provided trigger value against existing game
    objects, so it should be used with care to ensure the trigger ID corresponds to
    a valid inn object in the world.
  parameters:
  - name: trigger
    description: The integer identifier representing the inn trigger GameObject GUID.
      This value is typically obtained from a GameObject's entry or GUID and must
      correspond to a valid inn rest area in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an Inn Trigger
    code: 'RestMgr* restMgr = new RestMgr();

      restMgr->SetInnTrigger(12345); // Sets the inn trigger to GameObject with GUID
      12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore server when initializing
    rest management systems for specific zones or instances. Developers should ensure
    that the provided trigger ID corresponds to an actual inn GameObject in the database
    to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
