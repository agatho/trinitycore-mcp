  class: RoleAssignment
  method: HandleRoleConflict
  signature: void RoleAssignment::HandleRoleConflict(Group * group, GroupRole conflictedRole)
documentation:
  brief: Handles role conflicts within a group by resolving or notifying about conflicting
    roles.
  description: The HandleRoleConflict method is responsible for managing situations
    where multiple roles are assigned to the same player or when there are inconsistencies
    in group role assignments. This method typically triggers conflict resolution
    logic, which may involve reassigning roles, notifying players, or logging the
    conflict for administrative review. It is part of the group management system
    in TrinityCore and ensures that group composition adheres to defined role constraints.
    The method operates on a provided Group object and identifies the specific conflicted
    role that needs resolution.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object where the role conflict exists. This
      parameter is required and must point to a valid group instance.
  - name: conflictedRole
    description: The GroupRole enum value representing the specific role that has
      a conflict within the group. This indicates which role assignment needs to be
      resolved.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Management
    code: "void ExampleFunction(Group* myGroup, GroupRole role) {\n    RoleAssignment\
      \ roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.HandleRoleConflict(myGroup, role);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Conflict During Role Assignment
    code: "void AssignRoleSafely(Group* group, Player* player, GroupRole role) {\n\
      \    // Assume some logic determines a conflict\n    if (HasRoleConflict(group,\
      \ role)) {\n        RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n        roleAssign.HandleRoleConflict(group,\
      \ role);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the group management system
    when inconsistencies are detected. It may modify internal state of the group or
    send notifications to players involved in the conflict. Developers should ensure
    that groups passed to this method are valid and not null.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'group' can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Ensure that all group objects are properly initialized before calling this method.
    Also, be cautious of race conditions if multiple threads modify group roles simultaneously.
