  class: NearestHostileUnitCheck
  method: operator()
  signature: bool NearestHostileUnitCheck::operator()(int * u)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a hostile unit is within range and returns true if one is found.
  description: The NearestHostileUnitCheck::operator() method evaluates whether there
    exists a hostile unit (enemy) within the specified search range of the current
    unit. It is typically used in AI decision-making processes to determine if an
    enemy is nearby for combat purposes. The method updates the provided pointer to
    point to the nearest hostile unit found, or leaves it unchanged if no hostile
    unit is detected. This check is commonly used in creature AI behavior trees and
    spell targeting logic.
  parameters:
  - name: u
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be updated with the GUID of the nearest
      hostile unit if one is found. If no hostile unit exists within range, the value
      remains unchanged.
  returns: Returns true if a hostile unit was found within range and the pointer 'u'
    has been updated with its GUID; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI context
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    bool UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        int nearestHostile = 0;\n        if (NearestHostileUnitCheck()(nearestHostile))\
      \ {\n            // A hostile unit was found\n            // Use nearestHostile\
      \ as the target for attack or spell\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a functor pattern used in TrinityCore's AI system.
    The actual range and conditions for detection are determined by the implementation
    of NearestHostileUnitCheck, which may vary based on creature type or spell context.
  warnings: Ensure that the integer pointed to by 'u' is properly initialized before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior if no hostile unit is found.
