  method: GetWeakPtr
  signature: int Spell::GetWeakPtr() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the weak pointer value of the spell instance for tracking purposes.
  description: The GetWeakPtr method retrieves the weak pointer value associated with
    the Spell instance, which is used internally by TrinityCore's object management
    system to track references to spell objects without creating circular dependencies.
    This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related APIs to
    monitor the lifecycle of spells within the game world. The weak pointer value
    helps prevent memory leaks and ensures proper garbage collection when spell objects
    are no longer referenced by active players or NPCs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the weak pointer value of the spell instance,
    which is used for internal tracking purposes in TrinityCore's object management
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int weakPtr = spell->GetWeakPtr();

      // weakPtr now contains the weak pointer value for tracking

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal object tracking system and should not
    be used directly in gameplay code. The weak pointer value is managed automatically
    by TrinityCore's memory management system.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by game developers as it's intended
    for internal use only. Improper usage could lead to incorrect tracking or memory
    issues.
