documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of enemy healers within the AI's detection range
  description: The GetEnemyHealers method is used in PvPCombatAI to determine how
    many enemy healer units are currently within the AI's detection range. This information
    is crucial for making tactical decisions during player versus player combat, such
    as prioritizing damage dealers over healers or adjusting positioning strategies.
    The method does not take any parameters and returns an integer representing the
    number of detected enemy healers. It operates on the assumption that the AI has
    already performed necessary target scanning and filtering to identify valid healer
    units.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the count of enemy healers detected within
    the AI's range. Returns 0 if no healers are detected or if the AI has not yet
    performed detection logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Decision Making
    code: "void MyPvPAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    int healerCount = GetEnemyHealers();\n\
      \    if (healerCount > 0)\n    {\n        // Prioritize killing healers first\n\
      \        SelectTarget(SelectTargetType::HEALER);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n \
      \       // Focus on damage dealers\n        SelectTarget(SelectTargetType::DAMAGE_DEALER);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and relies on the
    AI's internal target scanning logic. The actual detection range and healer identification
    criteria are defined by the AI implementation. Performance-wise, this method should
    be lightweight as it only returns a cached count rather than performing expensive
    operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI has properly initialized its target detection system
    before calling this method. Calling GetEnemyHealers() without prior scanning may
    result in outdated or incorrect counts. Additionally, this method assumes that
    healer identification logic is already implemented and working correctly within
    the AI framework.
