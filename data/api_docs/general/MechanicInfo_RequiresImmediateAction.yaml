  class: MechanicInfo
  method: RequiresImmediateAction
  signature: bool MechanicInfo::RequiresImmediateAction() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the mechanic requires immediate action from the affected
    unit.
  description: The RequiresImmediateAction method checks if a specific mechanic type
    demands that the affected unit take immediate action, typically interrupting or
    halting ongoing actions. This is commonly used in combat systems to determine
    if an effect should immediately halt a spell cast, movement, or other actions.
    The method evaluates internal flags or properties associated with the mechanic
    to make this determination. It's particularly relevant for mechanics such as stun,
    fear, or root effects that interrupt player or creature behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the mechanic requires immediate action (such as interrupting
    current actions), false otherwise. This indicates whether the affected unit must
    cease its current activity upon being subjected to this mechanic.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a mechanic requires immediate action
    code: "MechanicInfo info;\n// Assume info is initialized with a specific mechanic\n\
      if (info.RequiresImmediateAction()) {\n    // Handle immediate action requirement\n\
      \    // e.g., interrupt current spell cast\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal mechanic flags or data structures within
    the MechanicInfo class. It's part of the core game mechanics system and should
    be used carefully in performance-sensitive contexts such as combat processing
    loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the MechanicInfo object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as uninitialized or invalid mechanics may produce undefined behavior.
    This method should not be called on temporary or unallocated objects.
