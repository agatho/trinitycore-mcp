documentation:
  brief: Loads innkeeper data from the database into memory for trade system functionality.
  description: The LoadInnkeepersFromDatabase method retrieves all innkeeper entries
    from the game database and populates internal data structures with this information.
    This method is typically called during server startup or when the trade system
    needs to refresh its innkeeper data. It ensures that all innkeepers are properly
    initialized with their respective NPC IDs, locations, and associated trade data
    required for player interactions such as innkeeping services and quest-related
    transactions. The method performs database queries to fetch relevant records and
    processes them into usable in-memory objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'TradeSystem tradeSystem;

      tradeSystem.LoadInnkeepersFromDatabase();

      // Innkeeper data is now loaded and available for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    database content has changed. It's not thread-safe and should be executed in a
    single-threaded context. The method may block during database access operations
    depending on database performance.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate data entries. Ensure that the database connection is
    properly established before invoking this method.
