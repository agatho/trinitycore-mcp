api:
  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: GetBidder
  signature: int BlackMarketEntry::GetBidder() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the player who placed the highest bid on
    this black market item.
  description: The GetBidder method retrieves the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the player who currently holds the highest bid for a specific black market
    auction item. This method is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's
    Black Market Auction House system, where players can bid on various items. The
    returned value represents the database identifier of the bidder and can be used
    to retrieve detailed information about the player, such as their name or current
    inventory status. It is important to note that this method only returns valid
    data when a bid has been placed; otherwise, it may return an invalid or default
    GUID value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the player who placed the highest
    bid on this black market item. If no bids have been placed, the method typically
    returns 0 or a special invalid identifier value.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item has been bid on
    code: "BlackMarketEntry* entry = sBlackMarketMgr->GetBlackMarketEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int bidderGuid = entry->GetBidder();\n    if (bidderGuid\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        // There is a valid bidder\n        Player* bidder =\
      \ ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player, bidderGuid));\n  \
      \      if (bidder)\n        {\n            sLog->outString(\"Highest bidder:\
      \ %s\", bidder->GetName().c_str());\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n   \
      \     sLog->outString(\"No bids placed on this item.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Black Market Auction House system and assumes
    that the BlackMarketEntry object has been properly initialized with auction data.
    The returned GUID should be validated before use to ensure it represents a valid
    player in the game world.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without checking if bids exist, as
    returning a default value (like 0) may lead to incorrect behavior or errors when
    attempting to access player data.
