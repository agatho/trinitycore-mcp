  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::UpdateTracking()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the tracking state of the beast mastery hunter's pet based on current
    game conditions.
  description: The UpdateTracking method is responsible for managing and synchronizing
    the tracking behavior of a beast mastery hunter's pet within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically handles updates to the pet's target tracking status, including
    whether it is actively tracking enemies, updating threat levels, or adjusting
    its combat behavior based on the hunter's current abilities and talents. It may
    also interact with the pet's AI state machine to ensure proper engagement with
    targets. The method is generally called during game loop updates or in response
    to specific events such as target changes or ability usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    hunter->UpdateTracking();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked automatically by the core game engine during
    each update cycle for active hunters. Developers should be aware that this method
    may have performance implications if it performs heavy calculations or frequent
    database access. It's recommended to avoid calling this method excessively outside
    of normal update cycles.
  warnings: Calling UpdateTracking manually in inappropriate contexts may lead to
    inconsistent pet behavior or synchronization issues with the game state. Ensure
    that all necessary preconditions (such as active pet and valid target) are met
    before invoking this method directly.
