  class: Map
  method: AddToActive
  signature: void Map::AddToActive(WorldObject * obj)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a WorldObject to the map's active object list for processing.
  description: The AddToActive method registers a WorldObject with the Map instance,
    making it part of the active objects that are processed during each update cycle.
    This ensures that the object is included in various systems such as visibility
    calculations, AI updates, and collision detection. The method typically gets called
    when an object enters the map's active range or becomes visible to players. It
    is an internal method used by the core game loop and should not be called directly
    by most addon or module code.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject to be added to the active list. Must be
      a valid object that has been properly initialized and is associated with this
      map.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Creature to Active Map Objects
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      // ... initialize creature ...

      map->AddToActive(creature);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spawn Logic
    code: "void SpawnGameObject(Map* map, GameObject* go)\n{\n    // ... set up game\
      \ object ...\n    map->AddToActive(go);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal object management system. It modifies
    internal data structures and should only be called when an object transitions
    into the active state on the map. The method does not perform any validation checks
    on the input object, so it's the caller's responsibility to ensure the object
    is valid.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer or an invalid WorldObject can
    lead to undefined behavior. It should only be used when you are certain that the
    object has been properly initialized and is ready to be processed by the map's
    systems.
