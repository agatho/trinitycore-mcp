  method: LoadScripts
  signature: void Aura::LoadScripts()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all script configurations for the aura, enabling dynamic behavior and
    effects based on defined rules.
  description: The LoadScripts method initializes and processes all script-related
    configurations associated with an aura instance. This method is responsible for
    setting up the dynamic behavior of auras by loading external script definitions
    that determine how the aura interacts with game mechanics, such as periodic effects,
    proc triggers, or custom behaviors. It typically involves parsing script files
    or configuration data to establish the proper execution context for the aura's
    actions. The method ensures that all relevant scripts are loaded and ready for
    use during gameplay, particularly when the aura is applied or activated.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Aura* aura = new Aura();

      aura->LoadScripts();

      // Script loading complete'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the initialization phase of an aura,
    ensuring that all script configurations are properly loaded before any gameplay
    events occur. Performance considerations include potential delays if scripts contain
    complex logic or large datasets.
  warnings: Improper loading of scripts may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes
    if the script configuration is malformed or incompatible with current game mechanics.
