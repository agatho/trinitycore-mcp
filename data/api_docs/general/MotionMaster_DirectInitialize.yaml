  class: MotionMaster
  method: DirectInitialize
  signature: void MotionMaster::DirectInitialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the motion master's internal state and resets all active movement
    generators.
  description: The DirectInitialize method performs a complete reset of the MotionMaster's
    movement state. It clears any existing movement generators, resets the motion
    slot states, and prepares the motion master for a fresh set of movement instructions.
    This method is typically invoked during object initialization or when transitioning
    between different movement contexts within the AI system. The operation ensures
    that no stale movement data persists and that the motion master starts with a
    clean slate for subsequent movement commands.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during object creation
    code: "void Creature::OnSpawn()\n{\n    // Reset motion state on spawn\n    m_MotionMaster.DirectInitialize();\n\
      \    // Proceed with normal initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI transition logic
    code: "void UnitAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Clear previous movement states\n\
      \    me->GetMotionMaster()->DirectInitialize();\n    // Set new combat movement\n\
      \    me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(me->GetVictim());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the motion master is in a state where
    it's safe to clear all movement generators. It's typically used internally by
    the core AI system and should not be invoked directly from regular gameplay code
    unless you're certain about the implications of clearing movement states.
  warnings: Calling DirectInitialize while an object is actively moving may cause
    unexpected behavior or movement glitches. Ensure that any active movement has
    been properly stopped or interrupted before calling this method.
