  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for abilities within the combat specialization.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking of abilities associated with a specific combat
    specialization. This method is typically called during each game tick or update
    cycle to decrement active cooldowns and handle the activation of abilities once
    their cooldown periods have expired. It ensures that players cannot use abilities
    before their cooldowns have fully completed, maintaining game balance and proper
    ability usage mechanics. The method processes all tracked cooldowns within the
    specialization and updates their remaining time based on the elapsed game time
    provided by the diff parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update cycle. This
      value is used to determine how much time has passed and how much cooldown time
      should be reduced.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Update all player combat specializations\n\
      \    for (auto& player : players)\n    {\n        player->GetCombatSpecialization()->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Cooldown Update for Specific Player
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nCombatSpecializationBase*\
      \ spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nif (spec)\n{\n    spec->UpdateCooldowns(50);\
      \ // Update with 50ms elapsed time\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game loop or update system,
    where it receives a delta time value to accurately simulate real-time cooldown
    progression. It's important that this method is called consistently and with accurate
    timing to ensure proper cooldown behavior across all players and abilities.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter can lead to incorrect cooldown
    calculations, potentially allowing players to use abilities too early or too late.
    This method should never be called without a valid time delta value.
