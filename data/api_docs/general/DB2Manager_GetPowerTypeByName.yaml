documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a PowerTypeEntry by its name from the DB2 database.
  description: The GetPowerTypeByName method searches the internal DB2 database for
    a PowerTypeEntry that matches the specified name. It is used to access power type
    definitions such as mana, rage, energy, and others that define how different resource
    types behave in World of Warcraft. This method performs a lookup operation using
    the provided string name and returns a pointer to the corresponding PowerTypeEntry
    structure if found, or nullptr if no matching entry exists. The method is typically
    used during game initialization or runtime when specific power types need to be
    referenced by their string identifiers.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const PowerTypeEntry object if an entry with the specified
    name is found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no match is found in the DB2 database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Power Type Entry by Name
    code: "const PowerTypeEntry* powerEntry = sDB2Manager->GetPowerTypeByName(\"MANA\"\
      );\nif (powerEntry)\n{\n    // Use the power type entry\n    printf(\"Found\
      \ power type: %s\\n\", powerEntry->Name);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the DB2 data, so performance
    may be impacted if called frequently. It is recommended to cache results when
    multiple lookups are needed for the same power type name.
