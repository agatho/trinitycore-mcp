documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell is affected by a specific family name and flags.
  description: This method checks if the current spell is affected by the specified
    family name and family flags. It is commonly used in spell processing to determine
    if a spell's effects are applicable to certain spell families or if specific flags
    are present. The method returns true if the spell matches the given family name
    and flags, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for handling spell interactions
    and determining which spells should be applied to specific conditions or effects.
  parameters:
  - name: familyName
    description: The spell family name to check against. This represents the category
      of spells (e.g., family 0 = 'None', family 1 = 'Mage', family 2 = 'Warrior').
  - name: familyFlags
    description: The family flags to check for. This is a bitmask that represents
      specific spell effects or categories within the family.
  returns: Returns true if the spell matches the specified family name and family
    flags, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsAffected(1, 0x00000001)) {\n    // Handle spell with family\
      \ 1 and flag 0x00000001\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nif (spellInfo &&\
      \ spellInfo->IsAffected(3, 0x00000008)) {\n    // Check if spell is affected\
      \ by family 3 with flag 0x00000008\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    for determining spell compatibility and effect application. Performance-wise,
    it's a lightweight operation that should not cause noticeable overhead during
    runtime.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with different family flags, as incorrect
    flag values can lead to false negative results. Ensure proper validation of family
    names and flags before calling this method.
