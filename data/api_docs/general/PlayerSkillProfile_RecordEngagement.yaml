documentation:
  brief: Records engagement data for a player's skill profile, including win status
    and duration.
  description: The RecordEngagement method logs gameplay engagement metrics for a
    player within the PlayerSkillProfile system. It captures whether the player won
    their last engagement and the duration of that engagement. This data is typically
    used for tracking player performance, calculating skill ratings, or determining
    achievements related to combat or activity participation. The method does not
    return any value but updates internal profile statistics based on the provided
    parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: playerWon
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player was victorious in the
      engagement. True if the player won, false otherwise.
  - name: duration
    description: Float value representing the duration of the engagement in seconds.
      Must be a positive number; negative values may result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage

    language: cpp
  - title: Recording a Loss with Duration
    code: playerSkillProfile->RecordEngagement(false, 98.3f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after completing a combat encounter or activity
    where player engagement is tracked. It's important to ensure that duration values
    are valid (positive floats) to maintain data integrity in the skill profile.
