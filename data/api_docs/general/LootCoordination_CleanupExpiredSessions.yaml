  brief: Removes expired loot coordination sessions from the system
  description: The CleanupExpiredSessions method is responsible for removing outdated
    or inactive loot coordination sessions from the LootCoordination system. This
    ensures that stale data does not persist in memory and helps maintain system performance.
    The method typically checks each active session for expiration timeouts and removes
    those that have exceeded their allowed duration. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    environment, this mechanism supports proper loot distribution mechanics by cleaning
    up obsolete coordination states.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: LootCoordination::CleanupExpiredSessions();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked periodically by the game's main loop or through
    a scheduled task to ensure cleanup occurs without blocking gameplay. It may be
    called from multiple threads, so thread safety considerations should be taken
    into account during implementation.
