  class: Battleground
  method: GetPlayers
  signature: const BattlegroundPlayerMap & Battleground::GetPlayers() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the map of players participating in the battleground.
  description: The GetPlayers method provides access to the internal map that stores
    all players currently registered in the battleground. This map is keyed by player
    GUIDs and contains the associated battleground player data. The returned reference
    is const, meaning the player list cannot be modified through this interface. This
    method is commonly used for iterating over all participants, checking player presence,
    or accessing player-specific battleground information during gameplay events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the BattlegroundPlayerMap which contains all players
    currently participating in the battleground, keyed by their GUIDs and mapped to
    their battleground player data structures.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating Over All Players
    code: "for (const auto& playerPair : bg->GetPlayers()) {\n    Player* player =\
      \ ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(playerPair.first);\n    if (player) {\n       \
      \ // Process each player in the battleground\n        sLog->outString(\"Player\
      \ %s is in battleground.\", player->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Player Presence
    code: "uint64 playerGUID = player->GetGUID();\nif (bg->GetPlayers().find(playerGUID)\
      \ != bg->GetPlayers().end()) {\n    // Player is currently in the battleground\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player %s is active in battleground.\", player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal data structure that should not
    be modified directly. The map remains valid only as long as the battleground instance
    exists and players are registered. Accessing this map during battleground cleanup
    or destruction may lead to undefined behavior.
