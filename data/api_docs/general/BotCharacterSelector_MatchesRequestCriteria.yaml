  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: MatchesRequestCriteria
  signature: bool BotCharacterSelector::MatchesRequestCriteria(int characterGuid,
    const int & request) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a character matches the specified request criteria for
    bot assignment.
  description: The MatchesRequestCriteria method evaluates if a given character, identified
    by its GUID, satisfies the conditions defined in the provided request. This method
    is typically used within the context of TrinityCore's bot system to filter and
    select appropriate characters for specific tasks or roles based on predefined
    criteria such as level, class, faction, or other character attributes. The method
    performs a logical check against internal criteria stored or derived from the
    request parameter and returns true if all conditions are met, otherwise false.
    It is designed to be efficient and thread-safe for use in multi-threaded environments
    where bot selection logic may be executed concurrently.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character being evaluated. This
      value must correspond to a valid player character in the database.
  - name: request
    description: An integer representing the request criteria that the character must
      match. The exact meaning and structure of this value depends on how it's defined
      within the bot system's configuration or request handling logic.
  returns: Returns true if the character with the specified GUID meets all the criteria
    defined in the request; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int guid = 12345;\nint req = 1001;\nbool result = selector.MatchesRequestCriteria(guid,\
      \ req);\nif (result) {\n    // Character matches the request criteria\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Selection Logic
    code: "for (auto& bot : availableBots) {\n    if (selector.MatchesRequestCriteria(bot.GetGUID(),\
      \ requestCriteria)) {\n        // Assign this bot to the task\n        AssignBotToTask(bot);\n\
      \        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that character data is accessible via the GUID and that
    the request parameter contains valid criteria definitions. The internal logic
    for evaluating criteria may involve database lookups or cached data structures
    depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Ensure that the characterGuid corresponds to an existing player in the
    database, otherwise behavior may be undefined. Also, verify that the request value
    is properly initialized and represents a known set of criteria to avoid incorrect
    matching results.
