  signature: bool LootTemplate::HasQuestDrop(const LootTemplateMap & store, uint8
    groupId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the loot template contains any quest items in the specified
    group.
  description: The HasQuestDrop method determines if there are any entries in the
    loot template that are marked as quest items within a specific group. This is
    used during loot generation to identify which groups of loot may contain items
    required for quests. The method iterates through all entries in the provided LootTemplateMap
    for the given groupId and returns true if at least one entry has the quest item
    flag set. This functionality is crucial for proper quest item distribution in
    World of Warcraft's loot system.
  parameters:
  - name: store
    description: A reference to a LootTemplateMap containing all available loot templates
      for lookup. This map holds the complete set of possible loot items that can
      be referenced during evaluation.
  - name: groupId
    description: The group identifier to check within the loot template. Groups are
      used to organize loot items into logical collections, such as different types
      of drops (armor, weapons, consumables) or quest-specific rewards.
  returns: Returns true if at least one item in the specified group is marked as a
    quest drop; otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the group contains
    any items that are required for quest completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for quest drops in a group
    code: "LootTemplate template;\nLootTemplateMap store;\n// ... populate store with\
      \ loot templates ...\nbool hasQuest = template.HasQuestDrop(store, 1);\nif (hasQuest)\
      \ {\n    // Process quest drop logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HasQuestDrop in a loot generation context
    code: "void ProcessLootGroup(LootTemplate& template, LootTemplateMap& store, uint8\
      \ groupId) {\n    if (template.HasQuestDrop(store, groupId)) {\n        // This\
      \ group contains quest items\n        // Apply special handling for quest drops\n\
      \        // e.g., ensure quest items are properly tracked\n    } else {\n  \
      \      // Regular loot processing\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore loot system during
    item distribution. It relies on proper initialization of the LootTemplateMap and
    correct assignment of quest flags to loot entries. The performance impact is minimal
    as it only checks for existence rather than retrieving full item data.
  warnings: Ensure that the LootTemplateMap passed to this method is fully populated
    with valid loot templates before calling this function, otherwise results may
    be unpredictable. Also note that this method does not validate the groupId parameter;
    invalid group IDs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
