  brief: Updates the state and tracking of havoc soul fragments for a player
  description: The UpdateFragments method manages the internal state of havoc soul
    fragments, including their count, cooldowns, and application to the player's active
    abilities. This method is typically invoked during combat events or periodic updates
    to ensure that the player's soul fragment resources are accurately tracked and
    available for use with havoc-based abilities such as Soul Cleave or other demon
    hunter powers. The method may also handle fragment regeneration, expiration, or
    synchronization with the player's current talent build and gear.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void DemonHunter::UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    // Called periodically during\
      \ combat\n    soulFragmentTracker.UpdateFragments();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Action Processing
    code: "void Player::ProcessPlayerAction()\n{\n    if (HasActiveHavocAbility())\n\
      \    {\n        soulFragmentTracker.UpdateFragments();\n        // Apply fragment-based\
      \ effects\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently during active gameplay, particularly
    in combat scenarios. It may perform internal checks for cooldowns and resource
    availability, so performance is optimized for regular execution.
