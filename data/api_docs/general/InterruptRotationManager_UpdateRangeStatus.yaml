  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: UpdateRangeStatus
  signature: void InterruptRotationManager::UpdateRangeStatus(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the range status of the target unit for interrupt rotation management.
  description: The UpdateRangeStatus method is responsible for evaluating and updating
    the current range status of a specified target unit within the context of interrupt
    rotation management. This method determines whether the target is within or outside
    the acceptable range for performing interrupt-based abilities, which is crucial
    for AI decision-making in combat scenarios. The method likely checks distance
    metrics against predefined thresholds and updates internal state variables that
    influence subsequent interrupt behavior. It serves as a core component in maintaining
    proper targeting and ability execution logic for units that rely on ranged interrupts.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose range status
      needs to be updated. This parameter must not be null, as attempting to update
      range status for a null target will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateInterruptStatus(Unit* target)\n{\n    interruptManager.UpdateRangeStatus(target);\n\
      }\n\n// Called during combat loop to maintain accurate range state"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Interrupt Rotation Logic
    code: "void CombatHandler::ProcessInterrupts()\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        if (Unit* target = player->GetVictim())\n        {\n       \
      \     interruptManager.UpdateRangeStatus(target);\n            // Proceed with\
      \ interrupt decision logic\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during combat updates, so performance
    considerations are important. The implementation likely involves distance calculations
    and may cache results to avoid redundant computations. Developers should ensure
    that the target unit remains valid throughout the lifetime of this call.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the target parameter can lead to crashes or
    undefined behavior. Always validate that the target unit is alive and valid before
    calling this method. The method assumes that the target unit's position data is
    up-to-date and accurate for range calculations.
