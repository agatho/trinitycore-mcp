  method: GetDifficultyName
  signature: const char * InstanceScriptDataReader::GetDifficultyName() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the localized name of the current difficulty level for the instance.
  description: The GetDifficultyName method returns a null-terminated string containing
    the localized name of the current difficulty setting for the instance. This is
    typically used in conjunction with instance scripts to provide contextual information
    about the current difficulty, such as displaying appropriate messages or adjusting
    behavior based on whether the instance is normal, heroic, or mythic mode. The
    returned string is managed by the core and should not be freed by the caller.
    This method is particularly useful for custom instance scripts that need to adapt
    their behavior depending on the difficulty level.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a null-terminated character array containing the localized
    difficulty name, or nullptr if no valid difficulty context exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Script
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerEnter(Player*\
      \ player) override\n    {\n        const char* difficultyName = GetDifficultyName();\n\
      \        if (difficultyName)\n        {\n            ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Entering %s mode.\", difficultyName);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Difficulty Name for Conditional Logic
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::OnCreatureDeath(Creature* creature) override\n{\n\
      \    const char* difficultyName = GetDifficultyName();\n    if (difficultyName)\n\
      \    {\n        if (strcmp(difficultyName, \"Heroic\") == 0)\n        {\n  \
      \          // Apply heroic-specific rewards or behavior\n            DoSomethingForHeroicMode();\n\
      \        }\n        else if (strcmp(difficultyName, \"Mythic\") == 0)\n    \
      \    {\n            // Apply mythic-specific rewards or behavior\n         \
      \   DoSomethingForMythicMode();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string is cached and managed by the core's difficulty system.
    It's safe to use in multiple contexts within the same instance, but should not
    be modified or freed by the calling code. The method relies on the instance's
    current difficulty context being properly set.
  warnings: Be cautious when comparing strings directly using strcmp() as it may lead
    to crashes if the returned pointer is null. Always check for nullptr before using
    the returned value.
