  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: InitializeStrategies
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::InitializeStrategies()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes performance optimization strategies for the TrinityCore server.
  description: The InitializeStrategies method sets up and configures various performance
    optimization techniques used by the PerformanceOptimizer class. This method typically
    prepares internal data structures, loads configuration settings, and activates
    relevant optimization algorithms that improve server efficiency. It is usually
    called during server startup or when performance tuning needs to be applied dynamically.
    The method ensures that all necessary resources are allocated and strategy parameters
    are properly initialized before any optimization routines begin executing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeStrategies();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server's initialization
    phase. Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    method performs no locking internally, so it should be called from a single-threaded
    context if thread safety is required.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or inconsistent optimization states. Ensure that all prior optimizations
    are properly shut down before reinitializing.
