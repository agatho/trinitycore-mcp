documentation:
  brief: Unregisters all registered player bot hooks from the system
  description: The UnregisterHooks method removes all previously registered hooks
    associated with player bots within the TrinityCore framework. This function is
    typically called during shutdown or cleanup phases to ensure that no dangling
    references or memory leaks occur from hook registration. It effectively resets
    the hook state for all player bot instances, allowing for clean re-registration
    of hooks if needed later. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    no return operations, making it a simple cleanup utility.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Shutdown Routine
    code: "void ShutdownPlayerBotSystem()\n{\n    PlayerBotHooks::UnregisterHooks();\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup code here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any major system shutdown or reinitialization
    to prevent potential memory leaks or undefined behavior. It's recommended to ensure
    no active player bots are running when this function is invoked.
