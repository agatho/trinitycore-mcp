  class: KitingManager
  method: AssessKitingPriority
  signature: KitingPriority KitingManager::AssessKitingPriority(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the kiting priority level for a target unit based on
    combat conditions and positioning.
  description: The AssessKitingPriority method determines how critical it is for the
    AI-controlled unit to maintain distance from its target during combat. It evaluates
    factors such as target's attack power, current health, proximity, and the AI's
    own movement capabilities to assign a priority level that influences kiting behavior.
    This priority helps the AI decide whether to engage, retreat, or maintain a safe
    distance. The method assumes the unit has an active target and is in combat state.
    It does not modify any internal state but returns a value that guides decision-making
    for kiting actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A KitingPriority enum value indicating the level of kiting importance.
    Possible values include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL, which represent increasing
    urgency to kite the target based on combat dynamics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "KitingPriority priority = kitingManager->AssessKitingPriority(targetUnit);\n\
      if (priority >= KitingPriority::HIGH)\n{\n    // Initiate kiting behavior\n\
      \    unit->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to dynamically adjust
    kiting behavior. It may be influenced by the unit's class, equipment, and current
    combat stance. The implementation likely considers distance, threat level, and
    target abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is valid and in combat before calling this
    method; otherwise, the result may be undefined or misleading.
