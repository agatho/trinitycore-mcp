api:
  class: Player
  method: SendPlayerBound
  signature: void Player::SendPlayerBound(const int & binderGuid, uint32 areaId) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends player bound information to the client, indicating the area where the
    player is bound.
  description: This method sends a player bound notification to the client, informing
    them about the area where the player is bound. It typically occurs when a player's
    binding location changes, such as when they enter a new zone or when their binding
    is updated after death. The method uses the provided binderGuid and areaId parameters
    to determine what information to send. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    game state consistency and ensuring players are properly informed about their
    binding status in the World of Warcraft client.
  parameters:
  - name: binderGuid
    description: The GUID of the binder object, typically representing a zone or instance
      where the player is bound. This parameter determines which specific binding
      information should be sent to the client.
  - name: areaId
    description: The area ID where the player is bound. This parameter specifies the
      location where the player's binding applies, and is used in conjunction with
      binderGuid to determine the exact binding information to send.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 areaId = 1234;

      int binderGuid = 5678;

      player->SendPlayerBound(binderGuid, areaId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when player
    binding changes occur. It's important to note that this method does not directly
    modify the player's binding state but rather sends a notification to the client
    about the current binding status. The implementation likely involves sending a
    packet to the client with specific binding information.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player's binding actually changes,
    as calling it incorrectly may cause confusion or incorrect behavior in the client.
    It is recommended to verify that the binderGuid and areaId parameters are valid
    before calling this method.
