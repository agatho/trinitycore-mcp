  method: operator()
  signature: bool PlayerAtMinimumRangeAway::operator()(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is at minimum range away from the current unit.
  description: The PlayerAtMinimumRangeAway::operator() method evaluates whether a
    specified player is positioned at or beyond the minimum required distance from
    the calling unit. This functionality is commonly used in AI behavior scripts to
    determine appropriate combat or movement decisions based on proximity. The method
    typically returns true when the player meets or exceeds the minimum range threshold,
    and false otherwise. It's often employed in creature AI logic to prevent players
    from getting too close during certain interactions or encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is at or beyond the minimum range away from
    the unit; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    bool UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (PlayerAtMinimumRangeAway()(player))\n \
      \       {\n            // Player is at minimum range, perform action\n     \
      \       DoSomething();\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal distance calculations and may involve collision
    detection or line-of-sight checks. It's designed to be efficient for frequent
    AI evaluations during combat or movement logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause undefined behavior. The minimum
    range threshold should be properly configured for the specific use case.
