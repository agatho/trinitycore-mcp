  method: HasAtonement
  signature: bool AtonementTracker::HasAtonement(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has atonement status applied.
  description: The HasAtonement method determines whether a specific player, identified
    by their GUID, currently possesses the atonement buff or effect. This functionality
    is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server
    implementation to manage player states and effects related to the atonement mechanic.
    The method performs a lookup in the internal tracking system to verify if the
    specified player has active atonement status.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check for atonement
      status. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from the game's object manager.
  returns: Returns true if the player with the specified GUID has atonement applied;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player has atonement
    code: "Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345));\n\
      if (player && atonementTracker->HasAtonement(player->GetGUID().GetCounter()))\
      \ {\n    // Player has atonement\n    sLog->outString(\"Player has atonement.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Player does not have atonement\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player does not have atonement.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AtonementTracker maintains an internal data
    structure to track players with active atonement. It is recommended to ensure
    that GUIDs passed to this method are valid and correspond to actual players in
    the game world.
