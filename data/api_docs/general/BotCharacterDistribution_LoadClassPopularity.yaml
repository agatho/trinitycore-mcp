documentation:
  brief: Loads class popularity data for bot characters from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadClassPopularity method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with class distribution information for bot characters. This data is
    typically used to determine how bots should be distributed across different character
    classes when generating new bot players. The method retrieves statistics such
    as class usage percentages or counts from the database and stores them in memory
    for quick access during bot creation and management processes. It is usually called
    during server startup or when the bot system needs to refresh its class distribution
    knowledge.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution botDist;

      botDist.LoadClassPopularity();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the necessary tables are populated with class distribution data. The loaded
    data is typically used by other methods in the BotCharacterDistribution class
    to make decisions about bot character generation.
