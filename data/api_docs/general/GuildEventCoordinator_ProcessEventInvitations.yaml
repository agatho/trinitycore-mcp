documentation:
  brief: Processes pending invitations for a specified guild event
  description: The ProcessEventInvitations method handles the logic for processing
    all pending invitations associated with a given guild event ID. It iterates through
    queued invitations, validates their eligibility, and either accepts or rejects
    them based on guild rules and player availability. This method is typically invoked
    during guild event initialization or when new members join the guild to ensure
    proper invitation handling. The method does not return any value but modifies
    internal state related to event participation and guild member status.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild event for which invitations should
      be processed. Must correspond to an existing event in the guild event system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Invitation Processing
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.ProcessEventInvitations(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Multiple Events in Loop
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\nfor (uint32 eventId : eventIds)\n{\n\
      \    coordinator.ProcessEventInvitations(eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after verifying that the event exists and
    has pending invitations. It may trigger additional system events such as mail
    notifications or guild chat messages when invitations are accepted or rejected.
    The method is designed to be thread-safe within the context of TrinityCore's event
    handling architecture.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid eventId may result in undefined behavior
    or system errors. Ensure that all event IDs passed to this method have been properly
    validated against existing guild events before invocation.
