  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: RecordSample
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::RecordSample(const MLPerformanceSample & sample)
documentation:
  brief: Records a machine learning performance sample for tracking and analysis.
  description: The RecordSample method is used to store a performance measurement
    sample collected during gameplay or simulation. This method typically logs data
    points related to AI behavior, system resource usage, or other measurable performance
    metrics that are relevant to machine learning model training or evaluation within
    the TrinityCore framework. The recorded samples can be later retrieved for analysis,
    statistical reporting, or model optimization purposes. This method is part of
    the MLPerformanceTracker class which manages collection and storage of performance
    data.
  parameters:
  - name: sample
    description: The MLPerformanceSample object containing the performance data to
      be recorded. This typically includes metrics such as execution time, resource
      consumption, AI decision latency, or other quantifiable performance indicators
      relevant to machine learning operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Sample Recording
    code: 'MLPerformanceSample sample;

      sample.executionTime = 150;

      sample.resourceUsage = 45.2f;

      sample.timestamp = getUnixTimestamp();

      tracker.RecordSample(sample);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording AI Decision Performance
    code: 'MLPerformanceSample aiSample;

      aiSample.executionTime = GetAIDecisionTime();

      aiSample.resourceUsage = GetCurrentMemoryUsage();

      aiSample.decisionType = "CombatAction";

      tracker.RecordSample(aiSample);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during performance-critical operations in
    the game loop. The samples are stored in an internal buffer or database that may
    be flushed periodically to persistent storage. Consider thread safety when calling
    this from multiple concurrent threads.
  warnings: Repeatedly calling RecordSample with large volumes of data without proper
    batching or flushing mechanisms may cause memory pressure or performance degradation.
    Ensure that the sample objects contain valid data before recording.
