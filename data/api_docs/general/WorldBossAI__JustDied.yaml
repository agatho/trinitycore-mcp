documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a world boss creature dies, triggering associated
    AI behaviors and quest updates.
  description: The _JustDied method is a virtual callback function in the WorldBossAI
    class that is invoked when a world boss creature's health reaches zero and the
    creature is about to be destroyed. This method serves as the primary hook for
    customizing behavior upon the boss's death, such as awarding loot, updating quest
    status, broadcasting messages to players, or triggering other game events. It
    is typically called internally by the core AI system after the creature has been
    fully processed for death but before it is removed from the world. Developers
    can override this method in derived classes to implement specific logic for their
    custom world boss encounters.

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyWorldBossAI : public WorldBossAI\n{\npublic:\n    MyWorldBossAI(Creature*\
      \ creature) : WorldBossAI(creature) {}\n\n    void _JustDied() override\n  \
      \  {\n        // Award quest credit to players\n        DoCast(SPELL_VICTORY_AURA);\n\
      \        // Send message to all players in range\n        Talk(SAY_DEFEAT);\n\
      \        // Spawn loot or additional NPCs\n        SpawnLoot();\n        WorldBossAI::_JustDied();\
      \ // Call base implementation if needed\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework and should not be called directly
    by external code. It is automatically invoked by the TrinityCore engine during
    creature death processing. The method is expected to be overridden in custom AI
    implementations, and developers must ensure that any overridden version calls
    the base class implementation if necessary for proper behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually as it will interfere with the core AI
    system's internal state management. Avoid performing heavy operations or blocking
    calls within this method to prevent performance degradation of the game loop.
    Ensure that all quest updates and player notifications are properly synchronized
    with the server thread.
