  method: ScheduleTasks
  signature: void BossAI::ScheduleTasks()
documentation:
  brief: Schedules all AI tasks and events for the boss encounter.
  description: The ScheduleTasks method initializes and schedules all combat-related
    AI behaviors, abilities, and timed events for a boss creature. This method is
    typically called during the boss's initial phase or when entering combat to set
    up the AI's execution timeline. It manages the ordering and timing of various
    boss abilities, health-based triggers, and other dynamic AI behaviors that define
    the encounter. The method ensures that all scheduled tasks are properly registered
    with the AI system and will execute at their designated times during the fight.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic BossAI Task Scheduling
    code: "class MyBossAI : public BossAI\n{\npublic:\n    void ScheduleTasks() override\n\
      \    {\n        BossAI::ScheduleTasks();\n        // Additional custom scheduling\
      \ can be added here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core AI system when
    a boss enters combat, but may also be called manually during specific encounter
    phases. It should only be called once per boss instance to avoid duplicate task
    scheduling. The method relies on proper initialization of the BossAI base class
    before execution.
  warnings: Calling ScheduleTasks multiple times on the same boss instance can lead
    to duplicate or conflicting AI behaviors. Ensure that this method is not called
    during active combat unless specifically required for phase transitions or reset
    scenarios.
