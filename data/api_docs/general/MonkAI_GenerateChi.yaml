  class: MonkAI
  method: GenerateChi
  signature: void MonkAI::GenerateChi(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates chi for the Monk AI character based on the specified amount.
  description: The GenerateChi method is responsible for increasing the chi resource
    of a Monk AI character by a given amount. This method typically represents the
    core mechanic of the Monk class in World of Warcraft, where chi is a key resource
    used for casting abilities and maintaining combat effectiveness. The method modifies
    the internal chi counter of the MonkAI instance, ensuring that the character's
    resource state remains consistent with game mechanics. It is commonly invoked
    during combat actions, passive regeneration, or specific ability triggers within
    the AI behavior system.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The integer value representing the amount of chi to generate. This
      value can be positive to add chi or negative to subtract chi, though typical
      usage involves positive values for resource generation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Generation
    code: 'MonkAI* ai = ...;

      ai->GenerateChi(5); // Adds 5 chi to the Monk''s current resource pool'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Chi Generation
    code: "if (player->GetPower(POWER_CHI) < 10)\n{\n    ai->GenerateChi(2); // Generate\
      \ 2 chi if below threshold\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the Monk's internal power tracking system
    and may trigger visual effects or UI updates when chi is generated. It should
    be called within the context of valid AI execution to ensure proper resource management.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter does not cause overflow or underflow
    in the chi resource system. Avoid calling this method outside of appropriate combat
    or AI update contexts to prevent inconsistent state.
