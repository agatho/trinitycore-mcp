  class: DeathRecoveryManager
  method: Update
  signature: void DeathRecoveryManager::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the death recovery manager's internal state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and managing the death
    recovery system within TrinityCore. It handles the logic for tracking player death
    states, managing recovery timers, and ensuring proper cleanup or restoration of
    player data after a death event. This method is typically called from the main
    game loop to maintain consistent state updates. The method processes any pending
    death recovery operations and advances internal timers based on the time delta
    provided.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed since the last update in milliseconds. This value
      is used to determine how much time has passed and affects the advancement of
      death recovery timers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    m_deathRecoveryManager.Update(diff);\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void World::UpdateWorld()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTimeDiff(m_worldLastUpdate,\
      \ getMSTime());\n    m_deathRecoveryManager.Update(diff);\n    // ... other\
      \ world updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game update loop to
    ensure proper death recovery state management. The implementation likely handles
    cleanup of temporary death-related data structures and may trigger resurrection
    events when appropriate.
