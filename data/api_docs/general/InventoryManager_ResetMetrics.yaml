documentation:
  brief: Resets all inventory-related performance metrics and counters to their default
    values.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears and resets all internal performance
    tracking metrics associated with the InventoryManager. This includes resetting
    counters for item operations, transaction logs, and any cached statistics that
    may have been accumulated during gameplay. The method is typically invoked when
    performance monitoring needs to be restarted or when cleaning up state before
    a new session begins. It ensures that subsequent metric collection starts from
    a clean baseline without carrying over previous data.

  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may affect ongoing performance
    monitoring. It is recommended to call this during low-activity periods or when
    the system is not actively tracking inventory operations.
