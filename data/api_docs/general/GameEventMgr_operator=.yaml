  method: operator=
  signature: GameEventMgr & GameEventMgr::operator=(GameEventMgr && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a GameEventMgr object, transferring ownership of its resources to the
    target object.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on a GameEventMgr
    instance. This function transfers all internal resources and state from the source
    GameEventMgr object (passed as an rvalue reference) to the current object, leaving
    the source in a valid but unspecified state. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft server implementation, this is typically used when reassigning GameEventMgr
    instances, such as during object initialization or replacement operations. The
    move assignment ensures efficient resource management by avoiding unnecessary
    copying of event data structures and associated game event information.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another GameEventMgr instance whose resources
      will be moved to this object.
  returns: A reference to the current GameEventMgr object after the move assignment
    has completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'GameEventMgr manager1;

      GameEventMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses operator=

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assignment with Temporary Object
    code: "GameEventMgr CreateManager() {\n    return GameEventMgr();\n}\n\nGameEventMgr\
      \ mainManager = CreateManager(); // Move assignment from temporary\n// The temporary\
      \ GameEventMgr is moved into mainManager"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should only
    be called with rvalue references. After a successful move, the source object remains
    in a valid state but its contents are unspecified. The GameEventMgr class likely
    manages collections of game events, so this move operation efficiently transfers
    those event collections without copying expensive data structures.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method on lvalue references as it may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that the source object is not used after a
    move assignment, as its state becomes unspecified. This operation should be used
    carefully in multi-threaded contexts where synchronization is required.
