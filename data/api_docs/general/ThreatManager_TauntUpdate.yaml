  brief: Updates threat levels for all targets in the ThreatManager
  description: The TauntUpdate method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the threat distribution within a ThreatManager instance. It ensures that all mobs
    or players currently in the manager's scope have their threat levels properly
    calculated and adjusted based on current combat actions, player behavior, and
    game mechanics. This method typically runs during combat updates to maintain accurate
    threat tracking and prevent NPCs from targeting the wrong player or losing focus
    of their target.

    a new target enters the threat scope. It may be called multiple times per tick
    depending on game mechanics and player actions.
