  class: RaidMarker
  method: RaidMarker
  signature: void RaidMarker::RaidMarker(int mapId, float positionX, float positionY,
    float positionZ, int transportGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a raid marker at the specified location on the given map with
    optional transport GUID.
  description: The RaidMarker method is used to create or update a raid marker at
    a specific position within a World of Warcraft instance. This functionality is
    typically employed by game systems to visually indicate important locations, objectives,
    or points of interest for players in group content such as raids or dungeons.
    The method accepts map identifier, coordinates (X, Y, Z), and an optional transport
    GUID which may be used to associate the marker with a moving platform or vehicle.
    It does not return any value but modifies internal game state related to raid
    markers.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map where the raid marker should be
      placed. Valid values are integer identifiers corresponding to valid World of
      Warcraft maps.
  - name: positionX
    description: The X coordinate of the marker's position on the map. Should be within
      the bounds of the specified map.
  - name: positionY
    description: The Y coordinate of the marker's position on the map. Should be within
      the bounds of the specified map.
  - name: positionZ
    description: The Z (vertical) coordinate of the marker's position on the map.
      May be used for elevation or depth in 3D space.
  - name: transportGuid
    description: Optional GUID of a transport entity (e.g., boat, elevator) that the
      marker may be attached to. If not applicable, this should be set to zero or
      invalid GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Raid Marker Placement
    code: RaidMarker(1234, 100.5f, 200.7f, 150.2f, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Raid Marker on Transport Entity
    code: RaidMarker(5678, 300.0f, 400.0f, 250.0f, 123456);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's internal marker system and may
    trigger UI updates for players in the same group or raid. It should be called
    from a context where map and player state are valid, typically within a game event
    handler or AI logic.
  warnings: Incorrect map IDs or out-of-bounds coordinates may result in undefined
    behavior or visual glitches. Ensure that transport GUIDs correspond to actual
    entities in the world to avoid invalid references.
