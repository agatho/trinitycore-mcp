  class: EconomyManager
  method: SetMinProfitMargin
  signature: void EconomyManager::SetMinProfitMargin(float margin)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the minimum profit margin for economy transactions within the game.
  description: The SetMinProfitMargin method configures the lowest acceptable profit
    percentage that players or NPCs can achieve from selling items in the game's economy
    system. This value affects how much markup is applied to item sales and influences
    player trading behavior. The method directly modifies an internal configuration
    parameter used by the EconomyManager class to enforce minimum profitability thresholds
    across all economic transactions.
  parameters:
  - name: margin
    description: A floating-point value representing the minimum profit margin as
      a percentage (e.g., 0.15 for 15%). Must be non-negative and typically ranges
      between 0.0 and 1.0.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Minimum Profit Margin to 15%
    code: 'EconomyManager* econMgr = sEconomyManager;

      econMgr->SetMinProfitMargin(0.15f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Minimum Profit Requirement
    code: 'EconomyManager* econMgr = sEconomyManager;

      econMgr->SetMinProfitMargin(0.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method updates a global configuration value that affects all economy-related
    transactions in the game world. Changes take effect immediately for new transactions
    but do not retroactively modify existing trades. The margin value is stored as
    a decimal (e.g., 0.15 represents 15%) and should be validated before setting to
    prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may lead to unrealistic economic inflation,
    while setting it too high could make trading unprofitable for players. Ensure
    that the margin aligns with your server's intended economy model and player expectations.
