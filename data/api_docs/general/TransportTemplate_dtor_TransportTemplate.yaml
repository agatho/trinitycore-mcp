  signature: void TransportTemplate::~TransportTemplate()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TransportTemplate object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~TransportTemplate destructor is automatically invoked when a TransportTemplate
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of memory and resources allocated for the transport template, including
    any associated waypoints, movement data, and internal structures. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, TransportTemplate objects represent
    the blueprint for transport systems such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving
    platforms within the game world. The destructor is responsible for releasing all
    dynamically allocated memory and ensuring no memory leaks occur when these templates
    are removed from memory.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of TransportTemplate
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    TransportTemplate* transport = new TransportTemplate();\n\
      \    // ... use transport ...\n    delete transport; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-allocated TransportTemplate destruction
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    TransportTemplate transport;\n    // ...\
      \ use transport ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when transport goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that all references to the TransportTemplate
    are cleared before it is destroyed to prevent dangling pointers. The destruction
    process may involve cleanup of complex data structures such as waypoint paths,
    movement patterns, and associated GameObject data.
  warnings: Do not manually call this destructor; let the C++ runtime handle its invocation.
    Attempting to call it directly can lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption.
