    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is eligible to accept a specified quest based on quest
    requirements and player state.
  description: The CheckQuestEligibility method evaluates whether a given player meets
    all prerequisites to accept a specific quest. It verifies conditions such as quest
    level requirements, previous quest completion status, required items or currency,
    and other game-specific eligibility rules. This method is typically used by the
    quest system to determine if a quest can be offered to a player or if it should
    be rejected due to unmet criteria. The result indicates whether the player is
    eligible, not eligible due to level, missing prerequisites, or other reasons.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to check eligibility for. Must
      correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      eligibility is being checked. Cannot be null.
  returns: 'Returns a QuestEligibility enum value indicating the result of the eligibility
    check. Possible values include: QUEST_ELIGIBILITY_OK (player can accept the quest),
    QUEST_ELIGIBILITY_NOT_LEVEL_REQUIREMENT (player does not meet level requirement),
    QUEST_ELIGIBILITY_ALREADY_COMPLETED (quest already completed), QUEST_ELIGIBILITY_MISSING_PREREQUISITES
    (player lacks required previous quests or items), and others as defined in the
    QuestEligibility enum.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest eligibility
    code: "QuestEligibility result = questPickup->CheckQuestEligibility(12345, player);\n\
      if (result == QUEST_ELIGIBILITY_OK) {\n    // Player can accept the quest\n\
      \    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    // Handle ineligible case\n   \
      \ player->SendNotification(\"You are not eligible for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using eligibility result to conditionally offer quest
    code: "QuestEligibility eligibility = questPickup->CheckQuestEligibility(67890,\
      \ player);\nswitch (eligibility) {\n    case QUEST_ELIGIBILITY_OK:\n       \
      \ player->AddQuest(67890);\n        break;\n    case QUEST_ELIGIBILITY_NOT_LEVEL_REQUIREMENT:\n\
      \        player->SendNotification(\"You are not high enough level for this quest.\"\
      );\n        break;\n    case QUEST_ELIGIBILITY_ALREADY_COMPLETED:\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      You have already completed this quest.\");\n        break;\n    default:\n \
      \       player->SendNotification(\"You cannot accept this quest at this time.\"\
      );\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database lookups and checks various player state conditions,
    so it may have performance implications when called frequently. It is recommended
    to cache results where possible or limit calls to only when necessary. The method
    assumes that the questId exists in the database and that the player pointer is
    valid.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null; passing a
    null pointer will likely cause a crash. Also, be aware that this method does not
    modify the player's quest state or add the quest to their active quests - it only
    checks eligibility.
