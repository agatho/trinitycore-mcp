  signature: void CollectionMgr::SendSingleMountUpdate(std::pair<uint32, MountStatusFlags>
    mount)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an update packet to the player's client containing information about
    a single mount's status.
  description: The SendSingleMountUpdate method is responsible for transmitting a
    mount status update to the player's client. This method takes a std::pair containing
    a mount ID and its associated status flags, and serializes this data into a network
    packet that is sent to the player. The update typically includes information such
    as whether the mount is learned, available, or if it has any special conditions
    applied. This method is part of the CollectionMgr class which manages various
    collection-related data for players in TrinityCore. It's commonly used when a
    mount's status changes, such as when a player learns a new mount or when a mount
    becomes unavailable due to game conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: mount
    description: A std::pair containing the mount ID (uint32) and its status flags
      (MountStatusFlags). The first element is the unique identifier for the mount,
      while the second element represents the current status of that mount including
      learned, available, or other conditional states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a mount update for a newly learned mount
    code: 'MountStatusFlags flags = MOUNT_STATUS_LEARNED | MOUNT_STATUS_AVAILABLE;

      std::pair<uint32, MountStatusFlags> mountData(12345, flags);

      CollectionMgr->SendSingleMountUpdate(mountData);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating a mount's status to unavailable
    code: 'MountStatusFlags flags = MOUNT_STATUS_LEARNED;

      std::pair<uint32, MountStatusFlags> mountData(67890, flags);

      CollectionMgr->SendSingleMountUpdate(mountData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the CollectionMgr when mount
    status changes occur. It's important to note that this method only sends a single
    mount update and does not handle bulk updates. The method assumes that the player's
    client is properly connected and ready to receive the packet. Performance-wise,
    this method should be used judiciously as it generates network traffic for each
    individual mount update.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the CollectionMgr
    or with invalid mount IDs may result in undefined behavior or client-side errors.
    Ensure that the mount ID exists in the game's mount database before calling this
    method. Also, be aware that sending frequent updates may impact server performance
    under high load conditions.
