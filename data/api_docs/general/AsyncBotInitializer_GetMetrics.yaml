  class: AsyncBotInitializer
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: PerformanceMetrics AsyncBotInitializer::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves performance metrics collected by the asynchronous bot initializer.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a PerformanceMetrics object containing
    collected performance data from the AsyncBotInitializer. This includes timing
    information, resource usage statistics, and other diagnostic data relevant to
    the initialization process of asynchronous bot operations. The returned metrics
    can be used for monitoring system performance, debugging bottlenecks, or analyzing
    the efficiency of bot initialization routines within the TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PerformanceMetrics object containing collected performance data such
    as execution times, memory usage, and other diagnostic statistics from the asynchronous
    bot initialization process. The metrics are typically used for performance analysis
    and system monitoring.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer initializer;

      PerformanceMetrics metrics = initializer.GetMetrics();

      std::cout << "Initialization time: " << metrics.initialization_time_ms << "
      ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis
    code: "AsyncBotInitializer botInit;\n// ... perform some initialization operations\
      \ ...\nPerformanceMetrics metrics = botInit.GetMetrics();\nif (metrics.initialization_time_ms\
      \ > 1000) {\n    LOG_WARN(\"Performance\", \"Bot initialization took longer\
      \ than expected: {} ms\", metrics.initialization_time_ms);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for debugging and performance monitoring purposes.
    The returned PerformanceMetrics object may contain timing data that reflects the
    actual execution time of asynchronous operations, which can vary based on system
    load and resource availability.
