  class: FrostDeathKnightRefactored
  method: ConsumeRunes
  signature: void FrostDeathKnightRefactored::ConsumeRunes(int type, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes specified runes of a given type for the frost death knight ability
    usage.
  description: 'The ConsumeRunes method is responsible for deducting a specified number
    of runes from the frost death knight''s rune pool. This method is typically invoked
    when executing abilities that require rune consumption, such as Obliterate or
    Howling Blast. The method takes two parameters: the type of rune to consume (e.g.,
    blood, frost, unholy) and the count of runes to consume. It ensures proper rune
    management within the game''s combat system for death knights. This function directly
    affects the player''s ability to perform actions and is integral to the death
    knight''s resource management mechanics.'
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: Specifies the type of rune to consume. Valid values are typically
      0 (blood), 1 (frost), 2 (unholy), or 3 (death). This determines which rune pool
      is affected.
  - name: count
    description: The number of runes to consume from the specified rune type's pool.
      Must be a positive integer, typically 1 or 2 for most abilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consume One Frost Rune
    code: 'FrostDeathKnightRefactored* dk = reinterpret_cast<FrostDeathKnightRefactored*>(unit);

      dk->ConsumeRunes(1, 1); // Consume one frost rune'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consume Two Unholy Runes
    code: 'FrostDeathKnightRefactored* dk = reinterpret_cast<FrostDeathKnightRefactored*>(unit);

      dk->ConsumeRunes(2, 2); // Consume two unholy runes for a powerful ability'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the death knight has sufficient runes
    of the specified type. The implementation likely includes checks to prevent negative
    rune counts and may trigger rune regeneration events upon consumption. It's important
    to ensure that this function is not called outside of combat or ability execution
    contexts to maintain game balance.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying rune availability can lead to invalid
    rune states or unexpected behavior. This function should never be invoked with
    a count exceeding the available runes of the specified type, as it may cause undefined
    behavior in the death knight's resource management system.
