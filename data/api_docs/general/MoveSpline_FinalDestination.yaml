documentation:
  brief: Returns the final destination vector of the movement spline
  description: The FinalDestination method retrieves the endpoint coordinate of a
    MoveSpline object, which represents the ultimate target position that the spline
    will move towards. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's movement system
    to determine where an entity (such as a player or NPC) will end up after completing
    its current path animation. The returned Vector3 represents the x, y, and z coordinates
    in the game world space. This method does not modify any internal state and is
    purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a Vector3 object representing the final destination
    coordinates of the movement spline in 3D world space.
  examples:
  - title: Getting NPC final destination
    code: 'MoveSpline* spline = unit->GetMoveSpline();

      const Vector3& dest = spline->FinalDestination();

      float x = dest.x;

      float y = dest.y;

      float z = dest.z;

      // Use destination coordinates for pathfinding or AI decisions'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if unit has reached final destination
    code: "MoveSpline* spline = unit->GetMoveSpline();\nconst Vector3& currentPos\
      \ = unit->GetPosition();\nconst Vector3& finalDest = spline->FinalDestination();\n\
      float distance = currentPos.GetDistance(finalDest);\nif (distance < 0.5f) {\n\
      \    // Unit is near final destination\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, so the returned Vector3 should
    not be modified directly. The MoveSpline object must be valid and initialized
    before calling this method. In TrinityCore's movement system, splines are typically
    used for smooth pathfinding animations rather than direct position updates.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid MoveSpline object may
    result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the spline has been properly initialized
    with a path before attempting to retrieve its final destination.
