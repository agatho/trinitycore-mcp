  brief: Initializes a new Guild object with default values and prepares it for use
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The Guild constructor initializes a new Guild instance, setting up
    internal data structures and default member variables required for guild functionality.
    This method is typically invoked when creating a new guild or loading an existing
    one from the database. It ensures that all necessary fields are properly initialized
    before the guild can be used in game operations such as member management, guild
    permissions, or communication systems. The constructor does not perform any database
    operations itself; instead, it prepares the object state for subsequent initialization
    by other methods like LoadFromDB().
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new Guild instance
    code: 'Guild* myGuild = new Guild();

      // The guild is now initialized and ready for further setup

      myGuild->SetGuildName("The Brave Adventurers");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should not be called directly in most cases. Instead, use
    factory methods or database loading functions to properly initialize Guild objects.
    The object created by this constructor will have undefined behavior until properly
    initialized with data from the database or other sources.
  warnings: Do not assume that a Guild object created via this constructor is immediately
    usable for gameplay operations. It must be fully initialized before any guild-related
    actions are performed, such as adding members or setting guild properties.
