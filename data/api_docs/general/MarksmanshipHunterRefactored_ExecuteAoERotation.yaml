  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the marksmanship hunter's AoE rotation logic for targeting multiple
    enemies
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for a marksmanship
    hunter's area-of-effect combat rotation. This method determines optimal spell
    usage and ability priorities when multiple targets are present within the hunter's
    range. It evaluates target count, enemy positioning, and available resources to
    select the most effective abilities for maximum damage output in AoE scenarios.
    The method integrates with the hunter's AI state machine and considers cooldowns,
    mana management, and tactical positioning to ensure optimal performance during
    group encounters or mob pulls.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or identifier
      for AoE targeting. This parameter is used internally by the AI to determine
      which enemies should be targeted in the rotation sequence.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int* target) {\n\
      \    // Implementation would evaluate multiple targets\n    // and execute appropriate\
      \ abilities based on rotation logic\n    if (target != nullptr) {\n        //\
      \ Process AoE targeting logic\n        *target = GetBestAoETarget();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the hunter is in an appropriate combat
    state with multiple viable targets. The implementation assumes that target management
    and resource tracking are handled by the parent AI system. Performance is optimized
    for frequent calls during active combat scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper AI state validation may lead to incorrect
    targeting or ability usage. Ensure that the hunter has sufficient mana and that
    cooldowns are properly managed before execution.
