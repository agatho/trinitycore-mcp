  class: BotAI
  method: GetQuestManager
  signature: const QuestManager * BotAI::GetQuestManager() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the quest manager associated with the bot AI instance.
  description: The GetQuestManager method provides access to the QuestManager object
    that handles all quest-related logic for the bot. This manager is responsible
    for tracking quest progress, handling quest acceptance, completion, and interaction
    with quest givers. The returned pointer is constant, meaning the quest manager
    cannot be modified through this interface. This method is typically used by other
    AI components or systems that need to query or manipulate quest-related data for
    the bot character.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the QuestManager object associated with this BotAI instance.
    Returns nullptr if no quest manager has been initialized for the bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest progress
    code: "if (BotAI* ai = bot->GetBotAI()) {\n    const QuestManager* questMgr =\
      \ ai->GetQuestManager();\n    if (questMgr) {\n        // Use quest manager\
      \ to check quest status\n        uint32 questId = 12345;\n        if (questMgr->GetQuestStatus(questId)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE) {\n            // Handle completed quest\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned QuestManager pointer is valid only as long as the BotAI instance
    exists. The method does not perform any locking or thread synchronization, so
    access should be coordinated if used from multiple threads. This method may return
    nullptr if the bot AI has not been properly initialized with a quest manager.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the QuestManager through the returned pointer
    as it is const. Be cautious when using this method in multithreaded contexts where
    the BotAI instance might be destroyed concurrently. Always check for null returns
    before dereferencing the pointer.
