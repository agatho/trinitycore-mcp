  class: FormationMovementGenerator
  method: MovementInform
  signature: void FormationMovementGenerator::MovementInform(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the formation movement generator that a creature has completed its
    movement.
  description: The MovementInform method is called when a creature controlled by this
    formation movement generator finishes its movement behavior. This method typically
    handles post-movement logic such as updating the creature's state, triggering
    events, or preparing for subsequent actions within the formation. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method plays a role in managing group-based
    AI behaviors where creatures move together in formations. It is part of the movement
    generator system and is invoked by the core movement infrastructure when a creature's
    current movement path concludes.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that has completed its movement. This
      parameter represents the specific creature instance for which the movement inform
      event is being triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_movementGenerator\
      \ && m_movementGenerator->GetMovementGeneratorType() == FORMATION_MOVEMENT)\n\
      \    {\n        // MovementInform is called internally when movement completes\n\
      \        // This example shows how the AI might react after movement\n     \
      \   if (!HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_MOVING))\n        {\n            // Perform\
      \ actions after movement completion\n            DoSomethingAfterMovement();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore movement system.
    Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing custom movement
    logic. The method assumes that the provided creature pointer is valid and belongs
    to the formation.
  warnings: Do not call MovementInform manually with invalid creature pointers as
    it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the creature passed
    in param0 is properly initialized and managed by the AI system.
