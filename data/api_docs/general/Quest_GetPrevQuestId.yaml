  class: Quest
  method: GetPrevQuestId
  signature: int32 Quest::GetPrevQuestId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the identifier of the previous quest in the chain.
  description: The GetPrevQuestId method returns the unique identifier of the preceding
    quest in a quest chain, allowing developers to determine the sequence of quests
    within the game's progression. This method is essential for understanding quest
    relationships and implementing quest logic that depends on prior quest completion.
    It typically returns zero when no previous quest exists or when the quest chain
    is not properly defined. The method is commonly used in quest scripts and event
    handling systems to maintain proper quest progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the identifier of the previous quest in the quest chain, or zero
    if no previous quest exists. A non-zero return value indicates that a prior quest
    is defined and should be completed before proceeding with the current quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Chain Retrieval
    code: "int32 prevQuestId = quest->GetPrevQuestId();\nif (prevQuestId > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Process previous quest\n    // This indicates that a prior quest exists\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in quest scripts as it may return zero
    even when a quest has a valid previous quest. The method is part of the Quest
    class and relies on internal quest data structures to determine the previous quest
    ID. Performance considerations are minimal as this method simply accesses stored
    data.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in quest progression logic, as it may
    return zero even when a previous quest exists. Ensure that your quest chain logic
    properly handles cases where no previous quest is defined or when the quest chain
    is not properly configured.
