documentation:
  brief: Disbands player groups that have been inactive for a specified duration.
  description: The AutoDisbandInactiveGroups method automatically evaluates all active
    player groups within the TrinityCore instance and disbands those that have exceeded
    the configured inactivity threshold. This functionality helps maintain server
    performance by cleaning up unused group compositions and prevents resource waste
    from idle player bots. The method typically checks group activity based on member
    engagement, last action timestamps, or combat involvement. It is designed to run
    periodically as part of automated maintenance routines.

    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      groupMgr->AutoDisbandInactiveGroups();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically, such as during server tick updates
    or scheduled maintenance tasks. It is typically invoked by the bot AI system's
    internal scheduler to ensure group cleanup without manual intervention.
