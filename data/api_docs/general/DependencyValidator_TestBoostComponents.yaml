  method: TestBoostComponents
  signature: bool DependencyValidator::TestBoostComponents()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the presence and compatibility of required Boost library components
    for TrinityCore functionality.
  description: The TestBoostComponents method performs a comprehensive check to ensure
    that all necessary Boost library dependencies are correctly installed, properly
    linked, and compatible with the current TrinityCore build. This validation is
    crucial for maintaining system stability and preventing runtime errors caused
    by missing or incompatible Boost libraries. The method typically runs during server
    initialization or configuration verification phases to confirm that the application
    can successfully utilize Boost's functionality for tasks such as threading, file
    system operations, and data processing. It returns a boolean value indicating
    whether all required Boost components are present and functional.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all required Boost library components are properly installed
    and compatible with the TrinityCore build; returns false if any component is missing,
    incompatible, or fails validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Initialization
    code: "if (!sDependencyValidator->TestBoostComponents())\n{\n    std::cerr <<\
      \ \"Critical: Required Boost components are missing or incompatible!\" << std::endl;\n\
      \    return false;\n}\nstd::cout << \"Boost component validation passed.\" <<\
      \ std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform file system checks and library version comparisons,
    which could introduce minor performance overhead during initialization. The validation
    process typically includes checking for specific Boost headers, verifying library
    linking, and confirming API compatibility. It's recommended to run this check
    early in the server startup sequence before other components attempt to use Boost
    functionality.
  warnings: If this method returns false, the TrinityCore server may fail to start
    or exhibit unstable behavior when attempting to use Boost-dependent features.
    Developers should ensure that all required Boost libraries are properly installed
    and linked before deployment. Running this validation on a system with outdated
    or incompatible Boost versions will result in failure even if the core functionality
    might otherwise work.
