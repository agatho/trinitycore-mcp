  signature: void BotSession::ProcessPendingLogin()
documentation:
  brief: Processes pending bot login requests and initializes session state for authenticated
    bots.
  description: The ProcessPendingLogin method handles the logic required to finalize
    the authentication process for bot sessions that have initiated a login request
    but are not yet fully authenticated. This method typically checks if a bot's credentials
    are valid, assigns appropriate permissions or roles within the game environment,
    and transitions the session into an active state where it can begin executing
    commands or interacting with the game world. It is commonly invoked during the
    initial connection handshake between the bot client and the TrinityCore server.
    The method assumes that preliminary validation has already occurred and focuses
    on finalizing the login sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a bot initialization flow
    code: "void BotManager::OnBotConnect(BotSession* session)\n{\n    // Assume credentials\
      \ are validated\n    session->ProcessPendingLogin();\n    // Session is now\
      \ ready for command execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a successful preliminary authentication
    check. It may involve internal state transitions and should not be invoked concurrently
    from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior validation of the bot's credentials
    can result in undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities. Ensure all preconditions
    are met before invoking this function.
