documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes quest item associations for game objects from the database.
  description: The LoadGameObjectQuestItems method populates internal data structures
    with information about which quest items are associated with specific game objects
    in the database. This functionality is essential for tracking quest progress,
    as it determines which items can be used on or obtained from particular game objects
    during quest completion. The method typically executes during server startup or
    database reload operations to ensure all quest item relationships are properly
    loaded into memory for runtime use.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadGameObjectQuestItems();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called as part of the ObjectMgr's initialization sequence
    and may involve database queries to fetch quest item mappings. It's important
    that this method runs before any quest-related operations are performed to ensure
    data consistency.
