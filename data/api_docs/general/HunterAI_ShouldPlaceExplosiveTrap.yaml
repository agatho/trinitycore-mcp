  class: HunterAI
  method: ShouldPlaceExplosiveTrap
  signature: bool HunterAI::ShouldPlaceExplosiveTrap() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter should place an explosive trap based on current
    combat conditions and AI logic.
  description: The ShouldPlaceExplosiveTrap method evaluates various factors such
    as target proximity, available mana, trap cooldowns, and environmental conditions
    to decide if placing an explosive trap would be beneficial for the hunter's current
    situation. This method is typically used by the HunterAI class to make tactical
    decisions during combat. It considers the hunter's current state, including whether
    they are in melee range of the target, if there are sufficient resources to cast
    the spell, and if the trap is not on cooldown. The decision-making process involves
    checking for optimal positioning, ensuring that placing the trap won't interfere
    with other abilities, and verifying that the trap will effectively contribute
    to the hunter's overall damage output or control strategy.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI determines that placing an explosive trap would
    be advantageous in the current combat scenario; otherwise returns false. The decision
    is based on factors such as target distance, available resources, cooldown status,
    and tactical positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (me->GetAI()->ShouldPlaceExplosiveTrap()) {\n    // Attempt to place\
      \ explosive trap\n    me->CastSpell(target, SPELL_EXPLOSIVE_TRAP, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with hunter AI loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (ShouldPlaceExplosiveTrap())\
      \ {\n        // Place trap logic here\n        DoCastVictim(SPELL_EXPLOSIVE_TRAP);\n\
      \    }\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making system for hunters in
    TrinityCore. It's designed to be called frequently during combat updates and should
    not perform heavy computations that could impact performance. The method relies
    on internal state tracking within the HunterAI class, so calling it outside of
    proper AI update contexts may yield inconsistent results.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from spell casting or other game logic
    without ensuring proper AI context. The method assumes the AI has access to current
    target information and resource states. Calling it in inappropriate contexts may
    lead to incorrect decisions or unexpected behavior.
