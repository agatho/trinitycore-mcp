documentation:
  brief: Moves a SceneMgr object to another SceneMgr instance, transferring ownership
    of its resources.
  description: The SceneMgr move constructor transfers all resources from the source
    SceneMgr object to the current SceneMgr object. This operation is typically used
    when creating new SceneMgr instances by moving existing ones, avoiding expensive
    deep copies. The source object becomes invalid after the move and should not be
    used. This method is part of the standard C++ move semantics implementation for
    SceneMgr objects. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    SceneMgr handles scene management for client-side visual effects and cinematic
    sequences.

  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a SceneMgr
    code: 'SceneMgr&& source = std::move(sceneMgrInstance);

      SceneMgr newSceneMgr(std::move(source));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. After moving, the source
    SceneMgr object should not be accessed or used. The move operation is typically
    more efficient than copying as it transfers ownership of resources rather than
    duplicating them.
  warnings: Using the moved-from SceneMgr object after calling this constructor results
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that no other code references the source object
    after the move operation.
