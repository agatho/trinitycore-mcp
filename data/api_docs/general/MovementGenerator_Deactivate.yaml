  class: MovementGenerator
  method: Deactivate
  signature: void MovementGenerator::Deactivate(Unit * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the movement generator for the specified unit, stopping its current
    movement behavior.
  description: The Deactivate method is used to disable a MovementGenerator instance
    for a given Unit. This typically occurs when the movement generator is no longer
    needed or when transitioning to a different movement state. The method ensures
    that any active movement behaviors associated with the generator are halted and
    cleaned up appropriately. It is commonly called during state transitions, unit
    destruction, or when resetting movement states in the game's AI system. The operation
    affects only the specific movement generator instance and does not impact other
    movement systems or generators attached to the same unit.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Unit object for which the movement generator should
      be deactivated. Must not be null, as attempting to deactivate a generator on
      a null owner may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation of Movement Generator
    code: "MovementGenerator* mg = owner->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();\n\
      if (mg)\n{\n    mg->Deactivate(owner);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivating a Specific Movement Type
    code: "if (owner->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator() && \n    owner->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator()->GetMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == IDLE_MOTION_TYPE)\n{\n    owner->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator()->Deactivate(owner);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the MotionMaster class when
    managing movement states. It should not be called directly unless implementing
    custom movement logic or debugging. The deactivation process may involve cleanup
    of internal resources, resetting flags, and ensuring that no further movement
    updates are processed for the owner unit.
  warnings: Calling Deactivate on a null owner pointer will likely cause a crash.
    Always verify that the owner is valid before calling this method. Additionally,
    improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent movement states or memory
    leaks if not paired with proper activation or removal of the generator from the
    motion master.
