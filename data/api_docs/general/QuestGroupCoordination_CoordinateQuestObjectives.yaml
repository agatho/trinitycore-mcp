  class: QuestGroupCoordination
  method: CoordinateQuestObjectives
  signature: void QuestGroupCoordination::CoordinateQuestObjectives(Group * group,
    uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates quest objectives for all members of a group.
  description: The CoordinateQuestObjectives method synchronizes quest progress and
    objective states across all players within a specified group. This ensures that
    when one member of the group completes a quest objective, the progress is properly
    reflected for all other group members. The method handles the distribution of
    quest data and updates to maintain consistency in group-based questing mechanics.
    It is typically invoked when a group member interacts with a quest-related object
    or completes a quest step that should be shared among group members.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose quest objectives
      need to be coordinated. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which objectives should be
      coordinated. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with group and quest ID
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    QuestGroupCoordination::CoordinateQuestObjectives(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to work within the TrinityCore framework and relies
    on proper group membership validation. It assumes that all group members are in
    the same zone and have access to the quest data. The coordination process may
    involve sending update packets to each group member's client.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, verify that the
    quest ID exists in the database to avoid potential errors during objective synchronization.
