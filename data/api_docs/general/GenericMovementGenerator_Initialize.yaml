  class: GenericMovementGenerator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void GenericMovementGenerator::Initialize(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the movement generator with the specified unit target.
  description: The Initialize method sets up a GenericMovementGenerator instance to
    begin controlling movement for a given Unit. This method is typically called during
    the creation or activation of a movement generator within the AI system. It prepares
    internal state variables and ensures that the movement generator is correctly
    linked to the target unit, allowing it to execute movement behaviors such as following,
    fleeing, or patrolling. The method does not perform any immediate movement actions
    but rather configures the generator for subsequent movement updates.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that this movement generator will control.
      This parameter must be a valid pointer to an existing Unit instance; passing
      nullptr may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Movement Generator
    code: 'GenericMovementGenerator* movementGen = new GenericMovementGenerator();

      Unit* targetUnit = player;

      movementGen->Initialize(targetUnit);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing with Different Unit Types
    code: 'GenericMovementGenerator* gen = new GenericMovementGenerator();

      Unit* npc = creature;

      gen->Initialize(npc);

      // Can also be used with player units

      Unit* playerUnit = player;

      gen->Initialize(playerUnit);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement generator pattern in TrinityCore's AI
    system. It should only be called once per instance, typically during object construction
    or activation. The target Unit must remain valid throughout the lifetime of the
    movement generator to prevent dangling pointer issues.
  warnings: Passing a nullptr as the parameter will likely cause crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the Unit pointer is valid and alive before calling this
    method. This method does not validate the type of unit passed, so care must be
    taken when using it with different types of Units (e.g., players vs. creatures).
