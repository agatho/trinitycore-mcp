  class: DB2Manager
  method: IsInArea
  signature: bool DB2Manager::IsInArea(uint32 objectAreaId, uint32 areaId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given object area ID is contained within a specified
    area ID.
  description: The IsInArea method checks if an object's area identifier (objectAreaId)
    falls within the boundaries of a defined area (areaId). This functionality is
    commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to validate spatial relationships
    between game entities and their respective areas, such as determining if a creature
    or player is located within a specific zone or subzone. The method likely utilizes
    internal DB2 data structures that define area hierarchies and containment relationships.
    It returns true if the objectAreaId is contained by or matches the areaId, and
    false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: objectAreaId
    description: The unique identifier of the area where the object resides. This
      typically corresponds to an AreaTable entry in the DB2 files.
  - name: areaId
    description: The unique identifier of the target area against which the object's
      area is checked for containment or equality.
  returns: Returns true if the objectAreaId is contained within or matches the areaId,
    otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the specified object's location
    falls under the given area's boundaries.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player is in Specific Zone
    code: "if (sDB2Manager->IsInArea(player->GetAreaId(), 141)) {\n    // Player is\
      \ in Elwynn Forest\n    // Perform zone-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate Creature Location
    code: "uint32 creatureArea = creature->GetAreaId();\nuint32 targetArea = 4567;\
      \ // Example area ID\nif (sDB2Manager->IsInArea(creatureArea, targetArea)) {\n\
      \    // Creature is within the specified area\n    // Trigger area-specific\
      \ event or behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures that define area relationships.
    It's optimized for performance as it may be called frequently during gameplay
    logic. The implementation likely uses precomputed area hierarchies to efficiently
    determine containment without traversing the entire area tree.
  warnings: Ensure that both objectAreaId and areaId are valid identifiers from the
    AreaTable DB2 file; invalid IDs could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect
    results.
