  class: RBACData
  method: GetRealmId
  signature: int32 RBACData::GetRealmId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the realm identifier associated with the RBAC data instance.
  description: The GetRealmId method returns the unique identifier of the realm to
    which the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) data belongs. This identifier is typically
    used within TrinityCore's authentication and authorization system to determine
    which realm a player or account is associated with. The method is read-only and
    does not modify any internal state of the RBACData object. It is commonly invoked
    during login procedures, permission checks, or when managing user access across
    different realms in a multi-realm environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the realm ID. A negative value may indicate
    an invalid or unset realm identifier, while a positive value corresponds to a
    valid realm within the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      // Assume rbacData has been properly initialized with realm information

      int32 realmId = rbacData.GetRealmId();

      printf("Realm ID: %d\n", realmId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Permission Checks
    code: "RBACData* rbac = session->GetRBACData();\nint32 currentRealmId = rbac->GetRealmId();\n\
      if (currentRealmId == 1) {\n    // Allow access to realm-specific features\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads immutable data from the RBACData
    object. The returned realm ID should be validated before use in critical operations,
    especially when dealing with cross-realm functionality or dynamic realm management.
  warnings: Ensure that the RBACData instance is properly initialized before calling
    GetRealmId, otherwise the result may be undefined or invalid. Avoid relying on
    negative return values as they might not always indicate an error condition depending
    on the implementation details of the underlying system.
