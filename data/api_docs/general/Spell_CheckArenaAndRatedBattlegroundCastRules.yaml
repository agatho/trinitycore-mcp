  brief: Checks whether spell can be cast in arena or rated battleground environments
  description: This method evaluates the conditions required for casting a spell within
    arena and rated battleground contexts. It ensures that the spell's requirements
    are met when players are participating in competitive play modes, including checking
    for valid target requirements, resource costs, and other game mechanics that may
    prevent spell casting during these specific gameplay scenarios. The method returns
    appropriate SpellCastResult values based on whether the spell can be cast or not
    within these restricted environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SpellCastResult indicating whether the spell can be cast in arena/rated
    battlegrounds. Possible return values include SPELL_CAST_OK, SPELL_FAILED, and
    other relevant error codes depending on specific conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell.CheckArenaAndRatedBattlegroundCastRules();\n\
      if (result == SPELL_CAST_OK)\n{\n    // Spell can be cast\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Spell cannot be cast, handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell validation in battlegrounds to
    ensure proper gameplay mechanics. It may involve checking for specific requirements
    like target validity, resource conditions, and other restrictions that apply only
    to arena/rated battleground environments.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context; it's
    primarily used internally by the game engine when validating spell casts in competitive
    play modes.
