  class: Player
  method: ReplaceAllRequiredMountCapabilityFlags
  signature: void Player::ReplaceAllRequiredMountCapabilityFlags(uint8 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all required mount capability flags with the specified flag value.
  description: This method replaces all existing mount capability flags in a player's
    data with a new single flag value. It is typically used during character creation
    or when updating a player's mount capabilities to ensure that only the specified
    flag is active. The method operates on the player's mount capability data structure,
    which determines what mounts are available to the player based on their current
    flags. This operation affects the player's ability to access certain mounts within
    the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The uint8 flag value that will replace all existing mount capability
      flags. This represents a single mount capability flag, typically used to set
      the player's mount status to a specific state such as 'unlocked' or 'available'.
      Valid values are usually 0-255, with 0 indicating no mount capabilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ReplaceAllRequiredMountCapabilityFlags(1);

      // This sets all mount capability flags to 1, effectively enabling a specific
      mount type'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player-related methods
    that manage mount data. It may be called during character creation or when updating
    a player's mount capabilities to ensure consistency. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this operation involves simple flag replacement.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect mount availability,
    potentially causing players to lose access to certain mounts or gain access to
    mounts they shouldn't have. Ensure that the flag value is appropriate for the
    intended mount capability state.
