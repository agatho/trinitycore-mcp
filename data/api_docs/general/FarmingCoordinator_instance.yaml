documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the FarmingCoordinator class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the FarmingCoordinator
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the coordinator exists throughout the
    application lifecycle. This method is typically used to access global farming-related
    functionality and state management within the TrinityCore server environment.
    The returned pointer should be used carefully as it represents a shared resource
    that may be accessed concurrently by multiple systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single FarmingCoordinator instance. The method will always
    return a valid pointer to the singleton instance, never NULL.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator* coordinator = FarmingCoordinator::instance();

      // Use the coordinator for farming operations

      coordinator->ProcessFarmingCycle();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Farming Data
    code: "FarmingCoordinator* coord = FarmingCoordinator::instance();\nif (coord)\n\
      {\n    // Access farming data or trigger farming events\n    coord->UpdateCrops();\n\
      \    coord->CheckHarvestStatus();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The FarmingCoordinator
    instance is typically initialized during server startup and remains valid for
    the entire runtime of the TrinityCore server. Developers should avoid creating
    additional instances of this class as it's designed to be a single global point
    of access.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, calling this method repeatedly will always
    return the same instance pointer. Be cautious when storing references to the returned
    pointer in multiple locations, as modifications to the coordinator state will
    affect all parts of the code that use it.
