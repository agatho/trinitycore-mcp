documentation:
  brief: Loads vehicle template data from the database into memory for use in the
    game world.
  description: The LoadVehicleTemplate method initializes and loads all vehicle templates
    stored in the database into the ObjectMgr's internal data structures. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when reloading game data. It processes
    vehicle entries from the 'vehicle_template' table, which defines the behavior,
    capabilities, and properties of vehicles such as mounts, war machines, and other
    rideable objects within the game world. The loaded templates are used to create
    vehicle instances when players interact with vehicle-related game objects or spells.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    sObjectMgr->LoadVehicleTemplate();\n    // Continue with other initialization...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup by the
    core initialization process. It's important to note that vehicle templates loaded
    via this method are cached in memory for fast access during gameplay, so changes
    to the database require a server restart or explicit reload command to take effect.
