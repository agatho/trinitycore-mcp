  brief: LearnQuestRewardedSpells teaches the player the spells rewarded by a quest.
  description: This method is responsible for teaching the player the spells that
    are rewarded by a specific quest. It typically occurs when a player completes
    a quest and is intended to grant the player the appropriate rewards, including
    spell learning, as defined by the quest's reward structure. The method ensures
    that the player receives all relevant spell rewards based on the quest's configuration,
    which may include spell learning, skill points, or other in-game benefits. This
    function is part of the standard quest completion process and should be called
    after a quest is successfully completed.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      Quest* quest = ...;

      player->LearnQuestRewardedSpells(quest);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during quest completion process
    and should not be invoked directly unless in special circumstances. The method
    relies on the quest's reward data to determine which spells to teach, so it must
    be used with a valid quest object.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a quest has been successfully completed.
    Calling it before quest completion may result in incorrect spell learning or game
    state issues. Also, this method does not handle quest-specific rewards that are
    not related to spells, such as skill points or reputation gains.
