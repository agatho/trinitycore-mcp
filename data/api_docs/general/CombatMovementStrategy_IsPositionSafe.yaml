api:
  class: CombatMovementStrategy
  method: IsPositionSafe
  signature: bool CombatMovementStrategy::IsPositionSafe(const int & position, Player
    * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified position is safe for the player to move to
    during combat.
  description: The IsPositionSafe method evaluates if a given position is considered
    safe for a player character to navigate to while in combat. This method typically
    checks factors such as proximity to enemies, terrain obstacles, and other environmental
    hazards that could pose a threat to the player's safety. It is commonly used by
    AI movement strategies to make decisions about pathfinding and positioning during
    combat encounters. The method takes into account the current state of the player
    and their surroundings to determine if moving to the specified position would
    result in a safe or dangerous situation.
  parameters:
  - name: position
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the game
      world. This value likely corresponds to a waypoint, node, or coordinate within
      the combat movement strategy's navigation system.
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object for which the safety of the position
      is being evaluated. The method uses this player's current state, location, and
      combat status to make its determination.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is considered safe for the player
    to move to during combat, or false if the position poses a threat or risk to the
    player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "if (strategy->IsPositionSafe(5, player)) {\n    // Move player to position\
      \ 5\n    player->MoveToPosition(5);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative path\n\
      \    strategy->FindAlternativePath(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with movement logic
    code: "void CombatMovementStrategy::UpdatePlayerPosition(Player* player) {\n \
      \   int currentWaypoint = GetNextWaypoint(player);\n    if (IsPositionSafe(currentWaypoint,\
      \ player)) {\n        MovePlayerToWaypoint(player, currentWaypoint);\n    }\
      \ else {\n        // Avoid dangerous positions\n        AdjustMovementStrategy(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely performs checks against enemy positions, line-of-sight
    calculations, and environmental hazards. It may also consider the player's current
    health, mana, or other combat-related attributes when making safety determinations.
    This method is essential for AI-driven movement in combat scenarios to prevent
    players from moving into harmful situations.
  warnings: This method should not be called with invalid player pointers as it may
    lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, since this is part of an AI strategy,
    the safety evaluation might change dynamically based on real-time combat conditions,
    so results should not be cached for extended periods.
