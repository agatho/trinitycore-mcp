  signature: void AuctionHouse::RemoveFromWatchList(uint32 playerGuid, uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an item from a player's auction house watch list.
  description: The RemoveFromWatchList method removes a specified item from the watch
    list of a given player in the auction house system. This functionality allows
    players to stop receiving notifications or alerts when certain items are listed
    for auction. The method operates on the player's unique identifier (GUID) and
    the item's identifier (itemId). It is typically used when a player no longer wishes
    to monitor a specific item's auction activity, helping to reduce clutter in their
    watch list and associated notifications.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose watch list will
      be modified. This value must correspond to an existing player in the database.
  - name: itemId
    description: The identifier of the item to be removed from the player's watch
      list. This value should match an item that exists in the game's item database
      and was previously added to the watch list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Item from Watch List
    code: 'AuctionHouse auctionHouse;

      auctionHouse.RemoveFromWatchList(12345, 56789);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to update the player's watch
    list entries. It may also trigger internal cleanup of related notification data
    or cache invalidation.
