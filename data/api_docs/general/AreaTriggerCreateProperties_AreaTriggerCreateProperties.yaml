  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AreaTriggerCreateProperties class with
    default values.
  description: The AreaTriggerCreateProperties constructor initializes a new instance
    of the AreaTriggerCreateProperties class, setting up default property values for
    area trigger creation. This class is used within the TrinityCore framework to
    define the properties and behavior of area triggers that are created in the game
    world. The constructor ensures that all internal member variables are properly
    initialized to their default states, which may include zero values, empty containers,
    or predefined default configurations. This initialization is crucial for ensuring
    consistent behavior when creating area triggers through the game's scripting and
    core systems.

  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of AreaTriggerCreateProperties
    code: 'AreaTriggerCreateProperties triggerProps;

      // Initializes a new area trigger properties object with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating area triggers programmatically. Developers should not need to explicitly
    call this constructor unless they are implementing custom area trigger creation
    logic. The class likely contains member variables for position, scale, duration,
    and other area trigger properties that are initialized to sensible defaults.
