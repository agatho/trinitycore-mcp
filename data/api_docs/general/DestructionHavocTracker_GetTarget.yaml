  class: DestructionHavocTracker
  method: GetTarget
  signature: int DestructionHavocTracker::GetTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target identifier for the destruction havoc tracker.
  description: The GetTarget method returns the unique identifier of the current target
    associated with the destruction havoc tracker. This identifier typically corresponds
    to a GameObject or Unit within the game world, representing the object that the
    tracker is currently focused on or tracking. The method is commonly used in spell
    or ability logic where targeting information is required for damage calculations,
    effects application, or visual feedback. It provides a consistent way to access
    target data without directly manipulating internal state variables.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the current target.
    A value of 0 typically indicates no valid target is set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int targetId = tracker.GetTarget();\nif (targetId != 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ target logic\n    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, targetId);\n\
      \    if (target)\n    {\n        // Apply effects to target\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID should be used with ObjectAccessor::GetUnit or ObjectAccessor::GetGameObject
    to retrieve the actual object reference. This method does not perform any validation
    on whether the target still exists or is valid.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned GUID is checked for validity (non-zero) before
    attempting to access the target object, as invalid targets may cause crashes or
    undefined behavior.
