    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the spell hit chance for the aura application.
  description: The HandleModSpellHitChance method adjusts the probability that a spell
    will successfully hit its target. This method is typically invoked during aura
    application or removal to modify the caster's chance to land spells. It directly
    influences combat mechanics by altering the accuracy of spell casts, which can
    be either increased or decreased depending on the aura's effect type and parameters.
    The modification occurs in real-time during combat and affects all spells cast
    by the affected unit.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter defines which specific aura is modifying
      spell hit chance.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation indicating whether the effect is being applied
      (true) or removed (false). This value determines how the spell hit chance modifier
      should be calculated and applied.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura effect should be applied (true)
      or removed (false). Controls the direction of the spell hit chance adjustment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Spell Hit Chance Modifier
    code: "void ApplySpellHitChanceAura(AuraEffect* auraEffect, AuraApplication* app)\
      \ {\n    auraEffect->HandleModSpellHitChance(app, 0, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Spell Hit Chance Modifier
    code: "void RemoveSpellHitChanceAura(AuraEffect* auraEffect, AuraApplication*\
      \ app) {\n    auraEffect->HandleModSpellHitChance(app, 0, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core aura handling system in TrinityCore and interacts
    with the spell hit chance calculation engine. It should only be called from within
    the aura application context to ensure proper state management.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method may lead to incorrect combat calculations
    or unexpected behavior in spell accuracy. Ensure that the aura application object
    is valid before calling this method.
