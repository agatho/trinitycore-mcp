  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: RecordFlight
  signature: void FlightMasterManager::RecordFlight(uint32 cost, bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records flight data including cost and success status for the player's current
    flight.
  description: The RecordFlight method is used to log flight-related information for
    a player's journey. It stores the monetary cost of the flight and whether the
    flight was successful or not. This method likely updates internal tracking systems
    within the FlightMasterManager to maintain records of player travel behavior,
    which may be used for achievements, statistics, or future flight route optimization.
    The method is typically called after a player has completed a flight path, ensuring
    that all relevant data is properly recorded in the game's backend systems.
  parameters:
  - name: cost
    description: The monetary cost of the flight in copper coins. This value represents
      the amount deducted from the player's inventory upon completing the flight.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the flight was successful (true)
      or failed (false). A failed flight might occur due to various reasons such as
      insufficient funds, invalid destination, or server issues.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flight Recording
    code: 'FlightMasterManager* fm = sObjectAccessor->GetFlightMasterManager();

      fm->RecordFlight(15000, true); // Records a successful flight costing 150 silver'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Failed Flight
    code: 'FlightMasterManager* fm = sObjectAccessor->GetFlightMasterManager();

      fm->RecordFlight(0, false); // Records a failed flight with no cost'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's flight log database entries
    and may trigger additional events or updates in the game state. It should only
    be called after verifying that the flight has been processed and completed.
  warnings: Ensure that the cost parameter is properly validated before calling this
    method to prevent incorrect data from being recorded. Calling this method without
    proper context might lead to inconsistent player flight statistics.
