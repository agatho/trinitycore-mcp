  class: GroupEventBus
  method: operator=
  signature: GroupEventBus & GroupEventBus::operator=(const GroupEventBus & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one GroupEventBus object to another, performing a
    deep copy of its event handlers and associated data.
  description: The operator= method implements the assignment operator for the GroupEventBus
    class. It performs a deep copy of all event handlers and internal data from the
    source GroupEventBus object to the target object. This ensures that after assignment,
    both objects maintain independent copies of their event subscriptions and state
    information. In the context of TrinityCore's group management system, this operation
    is crucial when transferring group event subscriptions between different group
    instances or when duplicating group event handling configurations. The method
    properly handles memory management to prevent resource leaks and ensures thread
    safety during the copy process.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source GroupEventBus object whose contents will be copied to
      this object. This parameter must not be null or an invalid object reference.
  returns: A reference to the current GroupEventBus object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'GroupEventBus sourceBus;

      GroupEventBus targetBus = sourceBus; // Uses operator=

      // Or alternatively:

      targetBus = sourceBus;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'GroupEventBus bus1, bus2, bus3;

      bus1 = bus2 = bus3; // Chained assignment using operator=

      // This assigns bus3''s contents to bus2, then bus2''s contents to bus1'
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely includes reference counting or smart pointer management
    for event handlers to prevent memory leaks. The method should be used carefully
    in multithreaded environments where group events may be active. Performance considerations
    include the overhead of copying potentially large collections of event handlers.
  warnings: Assigning a GroupEventBus object that is currently processing events may
    lead to inconsistent state or race conditions. Ensure no active event processing
    occurs during assignment operations. Avoid self-assignment without proper safeguards.
