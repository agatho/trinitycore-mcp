documentation:
  brief: Executes the basic paladin spell rotation logic for the AI-controlled paladin.
  description: The ExecuteBasicPaladinRotation method implements the core spell casting
    logic for AI-controlled paladins in TrinityCore. This method determines which
    spells to cast based on the current combat state, available mana, and target conditions.
    It handles the execution of primary offensive abilities such as Judgement, Holy
    Shock, and Seal-based attacks while managing cooldowns and resource allocation.
    The method is typically called during the AI's update cycle to make tactical decisions
    for optimal damage output or healing effectiveness.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void PaladinAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    ExecuteBasicPaladinRotation(nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has a valid target and that combat state
    is properly maintained. The rotation logic may vary based on the paladin's current
    specialization (Holy, Protection, or Retribution) though this specific implementation
    likely focuses on a general rotation pattern. Performance considerations include
    avoiding unnecessary spell checks when the paladin is not in combat.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the AI has an active target and
    is in combat state. Calling it outside of combat may result in invalid spell casting
    or undefined behavior. The method does not handle all edge cases such as specific
    talent configurations or raid buffs that might alter rotation priorities.
