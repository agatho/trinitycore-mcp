documentation:
  brief: Signals formation movement for a creature, initiating coordinated movement
    behavior.
  description: This method triggers the creature's formation movement, enabling it
    to participate in coordinated group movement patterns. It typically occurs when
    a creature needs to move as part of a larger formation, such as during scripted
    events or when following a leader. The method ensures that the creature's movement
    is synchronized with its formation members, maintaining proper positioning and
    avoiding collision with other creatures. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    game mechanics related to group-based creature behavior and movement coordination.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SignalFormationMovement();'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include ensuring that the creature's movement is properly
    synchronized with its formation members. This method likely involves setting up
    movement flags or states to indicate that coordinated movement should be initiated.
    Performance considerations are minimal, but may involve coordination with other
    creatures in the same formation.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the creature is part of a formation;
    calling it outside of formation context may lead to unexpected behavior or movement
    issues. Care must be taken to ensure that the creature's movement state is properly
    managed after calling this method.
