documentation:
  brief: Handles game event start and stop notifications for smart game objects
  description: The OnGameEvent method is invoked when a game event begins or ends,
    allowing SmartGameObjectAI instances to respond dynamically to event state changes.
    This method enables game objects to trigger specific behaviors, such as activating
    or deactivating interactions, changing visual states, or modifying their AI logic
    based on active game events. The method receives two parameters indicating whether
    the event is starting or stopping, and which event ID is involved. It's typically
    used in conjunction with the SmartAI system to provide conditional behavior for
    game objects that should respond to dynamic world events.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the game event is starting (true) or stopping
      (false)
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the game event being triggered, used to
      determine which event-specific logic should be executed
  returns: null

      \  if (eventId == 1234) // Example event ID\n    {\n        if (start)\n   \
      \         SetGoState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n        else\n            SetGoState(GO_STATE_READY);\n\

  - title: Advanced event handling with multiple events
    code: "void SmartGameObjectAI::OnGameEvent(bool start, uint16 eventId)\n{\n  \
      \  switch (eventId)\n    {\n        case 500:\n            if (start) \n   \
      \             SetGoState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n            else \n            \

      \          if (start)\n                SummonCreature(12345, GetPositionX(),\
      \ GetPositionY(), GetPositionZ(), 0, TEMPSUMMON_MANUAL_DESPAWN);\n         \
      \   else\n                DespawnCreatures(12345);\n            break;\n   \
      \ }\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI framework and integrates with TrinityCore's
    game event system. The implementation should be lightweight as it may be called
    frequently during event transitions. Consider using cached event data or precomputed
    states for performance optimization when handling complex logic.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations within this method as it can block the
    game loop. Do not call methods that modify the AI state in ways that could cause
    recursion or infinite loops. Ensure thread safety if the method is accessed from
    multiple threads.
