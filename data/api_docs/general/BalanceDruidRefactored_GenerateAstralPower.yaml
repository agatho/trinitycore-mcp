documentation:
  brief: Generates astral power for the balance druid character
  description: The GenerateAstralPower method is responsible for increasing the astral
    power resource of a balance druid character by a specified amount. This method
    typically gets invoked during gameplay events such as spell casting, damage dealing,
    or periodic effects that grant astral power. The implementation ensures that the
    power increase adheres to game mechanics and resource limits defined for balance
    druids. It may also trigger visual feedback or update UI elements to reflect the
    new power level.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of astral power to be added to the druid's current resource
      pool. Valid values are positive integers representing the amount of power to
      generate.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: druid->GenerateAstralPower(10);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Value
    code: 'uint32 powerGain = spell->GetSpellBonusDamage() / 5;

      druid->GenerateAstralPower(powerGain);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the character is a balance druid and
    has the appropriate class specialization. The implementation may include checks
    to prevent exceeding maximum astral power limits.
  warnings: Calling this method with negative values or zero may result in unintended
    behavior or no effect. Ensure that the amount parameter is always a positive integer
    to maintain game balance.
