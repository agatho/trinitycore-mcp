documentation:
  brief: Updates the formation of combat units based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateFormation method is responsible for managing and updating
    the tactical positioning of units within a combat group. It processes the current
    formation state, adjusts unit positions according to predefined formation rules,
    and ensures that all members maintain their proper relative distances and angles
    during combat engagement. This method typically runs in the game loop and uses
    the provided time delta (diff) to interpolate movement and update positioning
    smoothly. The method may also handle formation transitions, such as switching
    between defensive and offensive stances, or repositioning units when targets change.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void CombatAIIntegrator::UpdateFormation(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update\
      \ formation logic here\n    // Apply movement adjustments based on time delta\n\
      }\n\n// Called from main AI update loop\nvoid CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n\
      {\n    m_combatAIIntegrator->UpdateFormation(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game's update loop to ensure
    smooth formation behavior. It is recommended to pass the exact time delta (diff)
    from the main game tick to maintain consistent timing across different server
    loads.
