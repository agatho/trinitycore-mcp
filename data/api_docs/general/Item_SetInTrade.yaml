  class: Item
  method: SetInTrade
  signature: void Item::SetInTrade(bool b)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the item's in-trade status to indicate whether it is currently being
    traded.
  description: The SetInTrade method controls the in-trade state of an item, determining
    whether it is marked as being in a trade transaction. This method is crucial for
    managing item states during trading operations within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework. When set to true, the item is considered to be in trade; when set to
    false, it is removed from the trade state. The method affects the item's internal
    state and influences how the game handles item transactions, particularly in relation
    to auction house mechanics and player trading.
  parameters:
  - name: b
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the item should be marked as being
      in trade. True sets the item in trade, false removes it from trade state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetInTrade(true);

      // Item is now marked as being in trade'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the item's internal state flags and should
    be used carefully during trading operations. It does not affect the item's physical
    appearance or properties, but rather its status within the game mechanics. The
    method is typically called during trade transactions to ensure proper handling
    of items.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to items remaining in an incorrect
    trade state, potentially causing issues with item transactions and auction house
    operations. It should only be used when the item is actually being traded or when
    the trade transaction is concluded.
