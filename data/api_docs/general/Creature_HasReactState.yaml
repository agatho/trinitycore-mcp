documentation:
  brief: Checks if the creature has a specific react state.
  description: This method determines whether a creature possesses a particular react
    state, which is used in the context of AI behavior and combat mechanics. The react
    state represents the creature's current reaction status towards its target, such
    as being neutral, hostile, or friendly. This function is essential for understanding
    creature AI states and their interaction with players or other creatures during
    combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature has the specified react state, false otherwise.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating the presence or absence of the given
    react state in the creature's current state configuration.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->HasReactState(REACT_HOSTILE)) {\n    // Creature is hostile\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves checking against internal state flags or enums
    that define creature react states. It may be used in AI decision-making processes
    where creatures need to know their current reaction status to determine appropriate
    actions.
