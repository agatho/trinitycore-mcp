  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: GroupCombatTrigger
  signature: void GroupCombatTrigger::GroupCombatTrigger(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a group combat trigger with the specified name.
  description: The GroupCombatTrigger constructor initializes a new instance of the
    GroupCombatTrigger class, associating it with a specific name. This method sets
    up the internal state required for managing group-based combat triggers within
    the TrinityCore framework. The name parameter serves as an identifier for the
    trigger and is used to distinguish between different combat scenarios or group
    configurations. The method does not perform any immediate combat actions but prepares
    the object for subsequent operations such as enabling/disabling triggers or checking
    combat status.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A string identifier for the group combat trigger. This name is used
      to uniquely identify and reference the trigger within the system. Valid values
      are any non-empty string that conforms to the naming conventions of the TrinityCore
      framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: GroupCombatTrigger trigger("MyGroupCombatTrigger");
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Group Management
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger* trigger = new GroupCombatTrigger("ArenaCombatTrigger");

      // Later in code, use the trigger to manage group combat events

      trigger->Enable();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating combat trigger objects. Developers should ensure that the name provided
    is unique within their application context to avoid conflicts. The object created
    will not automatically activate any combat behavior; additional methods must be
    called to enable or configure the trigger.
  warnings: The GroupCombatTrigger class may require proper initialization of related
    systems before being used effectively. Ensure that all required dependencies are
    initialized prior to calling this constructor, especially if the trigger is intended
    to integrate with existing group management systems.
