documentation:
  brief: Drops account enhancements for player bots in the TrinityCore migration system
  description: The DropAccountEnhancements method removes all account-specific enhancements
    and configurations associated with player bot accounts during the migration process.
    This method is typically invoked when transitioning player bot data between different
    versions or systems within TrinityCore. It ensures that any legacy enhancements,
    custom settings, or version-specific configurations are properly cleaned up from
    the account records. The operation may involve database cleanup, cache invalidation,
    and state reset for affected accounts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the account enhancements were successfully dropped, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates a failure during the cleanup
    process or that no enhancements existed to be dropped.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in migration context
    code: "if (PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->DropAccountEnhancements()) {\n \
      \   // Account enhancements successfully removed\n    sLog->outString(\"Account\
      \ enhancements dropped successfully\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to drop account enhancements\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database operations and should be called during
    maintenance windows or system upgrades. It may have performance implications on
    systems with many player bot accounts. The method is part of the playerbot migration
    framework and should only be used when appropriate migration procedures are in
    place.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper migration context may result in data
    loss or inconsistent states. Ensure that all active player bot sessions are properly
    terminated before invoking this method. This operation cannot be undone without
    a backup.
