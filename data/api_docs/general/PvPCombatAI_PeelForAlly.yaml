  brief: Attempts to find and peel an ally from combat for PvP engagement
  description: The PeelForAlly method is designed to identify a suitable ally within
    the player's vicinity who is currently engaged in PvP combat, and then remove
    them from their current target to focus on the enemy. This behavior is typically
    used in PvP AI logic to coordinate group tactics or to reposition allies for optimal
    combat effectiveness. The method evaluates nearby players based on their PvP status,
    combat state, and proximity to determine if an ally can be successfully 'peeled'
    away from their current target. It returns true if a valid ally was found and
    peeled, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if an ally was successfully peeled from their current target
    and moved into PvP combat with the player; returns false if no suitable ally could
    be found or if the operation failed for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in PvP AI logic
    code: "if (pvpAI->PeelForAlly(&playerGUID, &allyGUID)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ peeled an ally from combat\n    // Perform additional actions like positioning\
      \ or casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's PvP combat system and
    may rely on internal AI state tracking. It should be used within appropriate PvP
    contexts where such tactical repositioning is valid.
  warnings: The method assumes that the player and ally are in a PvP-enabled environment.
    Using this outside of PvP zones or during non-combat situations may produce undefined
    behavior or return false without effect.
