  class: SceneObject
  method: BuildValuesUpdate
  signature: void SceneObject::BuildValuesUpdate(int * data, int flags, const int
    * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates the provided data buffer with update values for the scene object
    based on specified flags and target.
  description: The BuildValuesUpdate method is responsible for constructing an update
    packet that contains the current state of a SceneObject. It fills the provided
    integer array with relevant data fields depending on the specified flags, which
    determine what aspects of the object should be included in the update. The target
    parameter likely indicates the specific player or group receiving the update.
    This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore server to synchronize
    scene object states with clients, ensuring that players see accurate representations
    of dynamic world elements such as quest objectives, environmental effects, or
    interactive objects.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array where the update values will be written.
      The size and layout of this buffer must match what the client expects based
      on the flags provided.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer bitmask specifying which fields of the scene object should
      be included in the update. Different flag values correspond to different data
      categories such as position, orientation, or custom fields.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the target player or group
      for whom this update is intended. This may influence how the data is formatted
      or filtered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of BuildValuesUpdate
    code: 'int updateData[100];

      int flags = UPDATEFLAG_POSITION | UPDATEFLAG_ROTATION;

      const int* targetPlayer = nullptr; // Assuming global scope or valid pointer

      sceneObject->BuildValuesUpdate(updateData, flags, targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal update system and should not be called
    directly by external code. It's typically invoked during packet building operations
    when sending updates to players. The exact layout and interpretation of data in
    the buffer depends on the client protocol version and the specific flags used.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the flags can lead to incomplete or malformed updates,
    potentially causing visual glitches or synchronization issues for players. Ensure
    that the data buffer is properly sized to accommodate all fields selected by the
    flags.
