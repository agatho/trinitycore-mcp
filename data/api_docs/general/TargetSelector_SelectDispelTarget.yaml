  method: SelectDispelTarget
  signature: Unit * TargetSelector::SelectDispelTarget(bool hostileDispel)
documentation:
  brief: Selects a target unit suitable for dispelling buffs or debuffs based on hostility
    criteria.
  description: The SelectDispelTarget method identifies and returns a valid Unit pointer
    that can be targeted for dispel effects. It evaluates potential targets within
    the AI's current context, considering whether to prioritize hostile units (if
    hostileDispel is true) or friendly units (if false). This method is typically
    used by AI-controlled creatures or players to determine which unit should receive
    a dispel spell. The selection process may involve checking for active buffs or
    debuffs on potential targets and ensuring the target is within valid range and
    visibility.
  parameters:
  - name: hostileDispel
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to select hostile units (true) or
      friendly units (false) for dispel targeting. When true, the method prioritizes
      enemies with harmful effects; when false, it considers allies with beneficial
      effects.
  returns: A pointer to a Unit object that is suitable for dispelling. Returns nullptr
    if no valid target is found within the AI's scope or criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in an AI context
    code: "Unit* target = ai->SelectDispelTarget(true);\nif (target && target->HasAuraType(SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_DAMAGE))\n\
      {\n    // Cast dispel on hostile target with harmful aura\n    ai->CastSpell(target,\
      \ DISPEL_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Selecting friendly target for beneficial dispel
    code: "Unit* target = ai->SelectDispelTarget(false);\nif (target && target->HasAuraType(SPELL_AURA_MOD_INVISIBILITY))\n\
      {\n    // Cast dispel on friendly unit with invisibility aura\n    ai->CastSpell(target,\
      \ DISPEL_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI targeting system and relies on internal target
    selection logic. It may use various factors such as threat level, distance, visibility,
    and aura presence to make decisions. The method does not perform any spell casting
    itself but returns a valid target for further processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned Unit pointer is checked for null before using
    it in spell casting or other operations. Failure to check for null may result
    in runtime errors if no suitable target exists.
