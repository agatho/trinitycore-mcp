documentation:
  brief: Processes the completion of an active mover initialization packet from the
    client.
  description: The HandleMoveInitActiveMoverComplete method is invoked when a client
    sends a confirmation packet indicating that it has successfully initialized an
    active mover object. This typically occurs during movement synchronization or
    when a player's character state transitions to an active movement phase. The method
    handles the server-side logic for processing this client-initiated event, ensuring
    proper synchronization of movement states between the client and server. It plays
    a crucial role in maintaining consistent game state during complex movement scenarios
    such as vehicle boarding, mount activation, or other dynamic movement transitions.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMoveInitActiveMoverComplete(const WorldPackets::Movement::MoveInitActiveMoverComplete&\
      \ moveInitActiveMoverComplete)\n{\n    // Process the completion of active mover\
      \ initialization\n    // This method is automatically called by the packet handler\n\
      \    // No explicit return value required\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement synchronization system and should be
    invoked only through the standard packet handling mechanism. It's typically called
    during movement state transitions and requires proper client-server synchronization
    to maintain game consistency.
