  method: SetDisplayFromModel
  signature: void Creature::SetDisplayFromModel(uint32 modelIdx)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the creature's display ID from a specified model index.
  description: This method updates the creature's visual appearance by setting its
    display ID based on the provided model index. It allows for changing the creature's
    model without requiring a full respawn, making it useful for dynamic visual changes
    during gameplay. The method operates on the creature's current display information
    and can be used to switch between different models for the same creature type.
  parameters:
  - name: modelIdx
    description: The model index to set as the creature's display ID. This value corresponds
      to a specific model in the game's database, typically representing a creature's
      visual appearance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetDisplayFromModel(12345);

      // Sets the creature''s display to model 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may not immediately update the visual appearance if the creature
    is already spawned in the world. The display ID must correspond to a valid model
    in the game database, otherwise it will result in an invalid display. This method
    should be used carefully during gameplay to avoid visual inconsistencies.
  warnings: Using this method on creatures that are already spawned may cause visual
    artifacts or inconsistencies if not handled properly. Avoid setting invalid model
    indices which could lead to missing or incorrect visuals.
