  class: LFGQueue
  method: RemoveQueueData
  signature: void LFGQueue::RemoveQueueData(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes LFG queue data for the specified player GUID
  description: The RemoveQueueData method removes all LFG (Looking For Group) queue
    information associated with a specific player identified by their GUID. This method
    is typically called when a player leaves the LFG system, either manually or automatically
    due to timeout or group formation. The method ensures that any queued data, including
    role preferences, dungeon selections, and wait times, are cleared from memory.
    It's an essential part of maintaining clean state in the LFG queue system and
    preventing stale data from affecting future matchmaking operations.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG queue data should
      be removed. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the player's database
      ID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to remove player from LFG queue
    code: "void RemovePlayerFromLFGQueue(uint32 playerGuid) {\n    sLFGQueue->RemoveQueueData(playerGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing multiple players from LFG queue in bulk
    code: "void ClearMultiplePlayersFromLFGQueue(const std::vector<uint32>& playerGuids)\
      \ {\n    for (uint32 guid : playerGuids) {\n        sLFGQueue->RemoveQueueData(guid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and operates on the LFG queue data structure.
    It's typically invoked from player logout or group disbanding logic to ensure
    clean state management. The implementation likely involves removing entries from
    internal hash maps or lists that track queued players.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure the GUID corresponds to an actual
    player currently in the LFG queue before calling this method.
