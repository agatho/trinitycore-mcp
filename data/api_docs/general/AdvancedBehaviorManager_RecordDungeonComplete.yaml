documentation:
  brief: Records the completion of a dungeon for the player in the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    system.
  description: The RecordDungeonComplete method is used to log and track the successful
    completion of a dungeon instance by a player within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method likely updates internal tracking mechanisms, achievements, or quest
    progress related to dungeon runs. It serves as part of the advanced behavior management
    system that handles complex player interactions and progression events in World
    of Warcraft content. The method does not require any parameters and performs its
    operation based on the current player context and active dungeon session.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = player->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager();

      behaviorMgr->RecordDungeonComplete();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player successfully exits a dungeon
    instance, either through completing all objectives or defeating the final boss.
    It may trigger additional events such as updating achievement progress, unlocking
    rewards, or modifying player behavior states. The method assumes that the player
    is currently in a valid dungeon context and has completed the necessary requirements
    for the dungeon to be marked as complete.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method outside of a valid dungeon completion scenario
    may result in incorrect tracking of player progression or cause inconsistencies
    in achievement systems. Ensure that the dungeon completion logic properly validates
    that all objectives have been met before calling this method.
