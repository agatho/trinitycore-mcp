  class: Transport
  method: EnableMovement
  signature: void Transport::EnableMovement(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables movement for a transport object.
  description: The EnableMovement method controls whether a transport vehicle (such
    as a boat, zeppelin, or elevator) can move within the game world. When enabled,
    the transport follows its predefined path and moves passengers accordingly. When
    disabled, the transport stops moving but remains in place. This method is typically
    used during transport initialization, player boarding/landing events, or when
    handling special game mechanics that require stopping or resuming transport movement.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      transport movement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable transport movement
    code: 'Transport* transport = ...;

      transport->EnableMovement(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable transport movement during boarding
    code: "Transport* transport = player->GetTransport();\nif (transport)\n{\n   \
      \ transport->EnableMovement(false);\n    // Perform boarding logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the transport's movement state and is often
    called in conjunction with other transport-related methods like AddPassenger()
    or RemovePassenger(). The change takes effect immediately, but the actual movement
    behavior depends on the transport's path definition and movement handlers.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are actively boarding or disembarking
    from the transport may cause unexpected behavior. It is recommended to ensure
    all passengers have been properly handled before disabling movement.
