  class: QuestCompletion
  method: UpdateBotQuestCompletion
  signature: void QuestCompletion::UpdateBotQuestCompletion(Player * bot, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest completion status for a bot player based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateBotQuestCompletion method is responsible for processing and
    updating the quest completion state of a bot player within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically handles the logic required to progress or finalize quests
    that are assigned to bots, ensuring their quest data remains synchronized with
    game progression. It operates on a per-tick basis using a time delta parameter,
    allowing for real-time updates of quest-related information such as objective
    fulfillment, reward collection, or quest state transitions. The method is commonly
    invoked during the game loop to maintain accurate quest tracking for automated
    players.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest completion
      status needs to be updated.
  - name: diff
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since the last update, used to determine
      how much time has passed for quest progression calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void Update() {\n    for (auto& bot : botPlayers) {\n        QuestCompletion::UpdateBotQuestCompletion(bot,\
      \ diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Bot AI
    code: "class MyBotAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateQuestStatus(uint32 diff) {\n \
      \       QuestCompletion::UpdateBotQuestCompletion(player, diff);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core quest management system and should be called
    regularly in the game loop to ensure accurate quest state updates. It may involve
    database operations or internal caching mechanisms depending on the implementation
    details. The diff parameter must be accurately calculated to reflect real-time
    progression.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff value can lead to incorrect quest progression
    or timing issues. Ensure that bot players are valid and active before calling
    this method, as passing null pointers may cause crashes or undefined behavior.
