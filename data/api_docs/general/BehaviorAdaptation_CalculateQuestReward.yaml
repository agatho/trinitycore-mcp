    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the reward value for a quest based on bot behavior adaptation
    settings.
  description: The CalculateQuestReward method computes the monetary or experience
    reward value that a bot should receive for completing a quest, taking into account
    various behavioral adaptations and configuration settings. This method is typically
    used within the context of AI-driven bot behavior in TrinityCore-based World of
    Warcraft servers to dynamically adjust quest rewards based on the bot's current
    state, difficulty settings, and adaptation parameters. The calculation considers
    factors such as player level, quest difficulty, and adaptive reward scaling to
    ensure appropriate reward distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the quest
      reward is being calculated. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid bot instance.
  - name: questProgress
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the quest progress should be considered
      in the calculation. When true, the method may adjust rewards based on partial
      quest completion or progress milestones.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated quest reward. The value
    typically represents gold amount or experience points depending on the quest type
    and configuration settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Calculation
    code: 'float reward = behaviorAdaptation.CalculateQuestReward(botPlayer, false);

      // Calculates base reward for completed quest without progress consideration'
    language: cpp
  - title: Progress-Based Quest Reward Calculation
    code: 'bool isProgress = true;

      float progressReward = behaviorAdaptation.CalculateQuestReward(botPlayer, isProgress);

      // Calculates reward considering partial quest completion or progress milestones'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal adaptation parameters and configuration values
    that may vary between different TrinityCore server configurations. The reward
    calculation logic may be influenced by bot-specific settings such as difficulty
    level, experience multiplier, and reward scaling factors.
  warnings: Ensure the bot parameter is valid and not null before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The method may return zero or negative values if
    the bot's adaptation settings result in minimal reward calculations.
