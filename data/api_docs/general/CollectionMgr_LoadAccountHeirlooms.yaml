  brief: Loads account heirloom data for all players from the database
  description: The LoadAccountHeirlooms method retrieves and initializes heirloom
    data associated with each account in the database. This method is typically called
    during server startup or when loading player collections to ensure that all heirloom
    information is properly synchronized with the client. It processes the database
    results to populate internal collections and ensures that players can access their
    heirloom items according to game mechanics and account ownership rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldSession::HandlePlayerLogin()\n{\n    // ...\n    sCollectionMgr->LoadAccountHeirlooms(0);\n\
      \    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and when the CollectionMgr instance is fully initialized. It may involve significant
    database I/O operations depending on the number of accounts with heirlooms.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within a database transaction as it might
    cause deadlocks or inconsistent data states. Ensure that all related database
    queries are properly handled to avoid performance bottlenecks during server startup.
