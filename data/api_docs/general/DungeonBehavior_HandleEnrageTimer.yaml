    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the enrage timer logic for a dungeon encounter within a group.
  description: The HandleEnrageTimer method is responsible for managing the enrage
    mechanic in dungeon encounters. It evaluates the current state of the group and
    the encounter to determine if the enrage timer should be triggered, updated, or
    reset. This method typically checks whether the group has exceeded the allowed
    time limit for completing an encounter, and if so, applies the appropriate enrage
    effects such as increased damage or health reduction. The method is part of the
    DungeonBehavior class which manages various dungeon-specific behaviors and timers
    during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the players currently engaged
      in the dungeon encounter. This parameter is essential for determining group
      status, member count, and managing shared timers.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object that defines the current
      encounter state, including timer information, progress, and enrage conditions.
      This parameter provides context about which specific encounter is being handled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter handler
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.HandleEnrageTimer(group, encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom enrage timer logic
    code: "void DungeonBehavior::HandleEnrageTimer(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    if (!group || !encounter.IsInProgress())\n        return;\n\
      \n    uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\n    uint32 enrageTime = encounter.GetEnrageTime();\n\
      \    \n    if (currentTime > enrageTime)\n    {\n        // Apply enrage effects\
      \ to all group members\n        for (auto& member : group->GetMembers())\n \
      \       {\n            if (Player* player = member->GetPlayer())\n         \
      \   {\n                player->ApplyEnrageEffect();\n            }\n       \
      \ }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during dungeon encounter updates and should
    be invoked regularly to maintain accurate timer states. The implementation may
    vary depending on the specific dungeon type and encounter mechanics. Ensure that
    group and encounter parameters are valid before calling this method to prevent
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers for group or encounter parameters
    can lead to crashes. Always validate input parameters before invoking HandleEnrageTimer.
    This method modifies player states and should be used carefully in multi-threaded
    environments where group state changes might occur concurrently.
