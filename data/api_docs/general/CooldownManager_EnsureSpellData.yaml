  signature: void CooldownManager::EnsureSpellData(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes or retrieves spell data for a given spell ID within the cooldown
    manager.
  description: The EnsureSpellData method ensures that spell data is properly initialized
    and available for the specified spell ID within the CooldownManager. This method
    is typically used to prepare internal structures or caches for spells that may
    be subject to cooldowns, ensuring that subsequent operations involving the spell
    can proceed without missing data. It is commonly invoked when a spell is first
    encountered or when cooldown information needs to be accessed for gameplay mechanics
    such as spell restrictions, cooldown timers, or UI updates. The method does not
    return any value but modifies internal state to guarantee spell data availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CooldownManager* cm = player->GetCooldownManager();

      cm->EnsureSpellData(12345); // Ensures spell data for spell ID 12345 is initialized'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs lazy initialization of spell-related cooldown
    data structures. It should be called before accessing cooldown information for
    a spell to prevent potential runtime errors or undefined behavior.
