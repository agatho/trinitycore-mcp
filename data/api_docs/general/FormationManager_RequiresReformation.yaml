  method: RequiresReformation
  signature: bool FormationManager::RequiresReformation()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the formation requires reformation based on current conditions.
  description: The RequiresReformation method evaluates the current state of a formation
    to determine if it needs to be reorganized or recalculated. This typically occurs
    when unit positions, leadership changes, or environmental factors affect the optimal
    formation layout. The method checks various internal flags and conditions that
    indicate whether the existing formation is still valid or if a new formation calculation
    is required. It serves as a decision point in the AI behavior system for managing
    group positioning during combat or movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the formation requires reformation due to changed conditions,
    false otherwise. The return value indicates whether the current formation layout
    should be recalculated based on updated criteria such as unit positions, target
    changes, or tactical requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (formationManager.RequiresReformation()) {\n    formationManager.RecalculateFormation();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateFormation() {\n    if (formationManager.RequiresReformation())\
      \ {\n        // Trigger formation recalculation\n        formationManager.RecalculateFormation();\n\
      \        // Update unit positions based on new formation\n        formationManager.ApplyFormation();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to ensure formations
    remain optimal. It may involve performance considerations when checking multiple
    conditions, so caching of results might be beneficial in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Do not call this method excessively without proper caching or throttling,
    as it may trigger expensive recalculations if frequently invoked. The method assumes
    that formation state is properly initialized before being called.
