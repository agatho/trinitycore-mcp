  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: DetermineFormationRole
  signature: int LeaderFollowBehavior::DetermineFormationRole(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the appropriate formation role for a bot player based on its current
    state and group configuration.
  description: The DetermineFormationRole method evaluates the given bot player's
    attributes, such as class, level, and current group dynamics, to assign an appropriate
    formation role within the leader-follow behavior system. This role typically dictates
    how the bot should position itself relative to the leader during group activities
    like dungeons or raids. The method considers factors such as the bot's combat
    capabilities, available roles in the group (tank, healer, damage dealer), and
    its own class-specific abilities. It returns an integer representing the assigned
    formation role which is used by the AI system to guide the bot's positioning and
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose formation
      role needs to be determined. Must not be null.
  returns: An integer value indicating the formation role assigned to the bot. Possible
    values may include constants like ROLE_TANK, ROLE_HEALER, ROLE_DPS, or ROLE_NONE
    depending on implementation details and group requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player\nint role = leaderFollowBehavior->DetermineFormationRole(myBot);\n\
      switch (role)\n{\n    case ROLE_TANK:\n        // Handle tank role logic\n \
      \       break;\n    case ROLE_HEALER:\n        // Handle healer role logic\n\
      \        break;\n    case ROLE_DPS:\n        // Handle DPS role logic\n    \
      \    break;\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making process for group formations
    in TrinityCore. It may be called frequently during combat or movement scenarios,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account when implementing custom
    logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior or crashes.
