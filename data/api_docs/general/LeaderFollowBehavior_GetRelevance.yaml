  signature: float LeaderFollowBehavior::GetRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the relevance score of this leader follow behavior
    for the given bot AI context.
  description: The GetRelevance method evaluates how relevant or important it is for
    a bot to follow a leader based on the current AI state. This score is used by
    the bot's decision-making system to determine whether to engage in leader-following
    behavior. The relevance is typically computed based on factors such as distance
    to the leader, threat level, group composition, and other contextual conditions
    that affect the bot's tactical decisions. A higher return value indicates a stronger
    preference for following the leader, while a lower or zero value suggests that
    following is not currently beneficial.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the relevance score of this behavior. Values
    typically range from 0.0 (not relevant) to 1.0 (highly relevant), though exact
    ranges may vary based on implementation details and contextual factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "float relevance = behavior.GetRelevance(ai);\nif (relevance > 0.5f)\n{\n\
      \    // Bot should consider following the leader\n    ai->SetBehavior(BotBehavior::FOLLOW_LEADER);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using relevance to compare multiple behaviors
    code: "LeaderFollowBehavior followBehavior;\nAggroBehavior aggroBehavior;\nfloat\
      \ followRelevance = followBehavior.GetRelevance(ai);\nfloat aggroRelevance =\
      \ aggroBehavior.GetRelevance(ai);\n\nif (followRelevance > aggroRelevance)\n\
      {\n    // Choose leader-following over aggressive behavior\n    ai->SetBehavior(BotBehavior::FOLLOW_LEADER);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's decision-making cycle, often
    in conjunction with other behavior relevance calculations. It's important to note
    that the relevance score may change dynamically as the AI state evolves, such
    as when the leader moves or when combat conditions shift.
  warnings: Do not assume a fixed relevance value; the score can vary significantly
    based on dynamic game conditions. Calling this method outside of an appropriate
    AI context may lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior.
