  class: PathOptimizer
  method: AdjustForObstacles
  signature: bool PathOptimizer::AdjustForObstacles(MovementPath & path, const int
    & obstacles, float avoidanceRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts a movement path to avoid obstacles within the specified radius.
  description: The AdjustForObstacles method modifies a given movement path to prevent
    collisions with nearby obstacles by adjusting waypoints. It evaluates the current
    path and introduces detours or adjustments when obstacles are detected within
    the avoidance radius. This method is typically used during AI pathfinding to ensure
    units navigate safely around environmental hazards, static objects, or other entities
    that could block their movement. The function returns true if adjustments were
    successfully made to the path, or false if no changes were necessary or if the
    adjustment process failed.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: Reference to the MovementPath object containing the waypoints to
      be adjusted for obstacle avoidance.
  - name: obstacles
    description: Integer value indicating the number of obstacles detected in the
      path. This parameter may influence how aggressively adjustments are made.
  - name: avoidanceRadius
    description: Float value defining the radius around each waypoint within which
      obstacles are considered for avoidance. Larger values result in more pronounced
      detours.
  returns: Returns true if the path was successfully modified to avoid obstacles,
    false otherwise. A return of false may indicate no adjustments were needed or
    that the adjustment process failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Adjustment Example
    code: "MovementPath myPath;\n// Assume myPath is populated with waypoints\nint\
      \ obstacleCount = 3;\nfloat radius = 2.0f;\nbool adjusted = pathOptimizer.AdjustForObstacles(myPath,\
      \ obstacleCount, radius);\nif (adjusted) {\n    // Path has been modified to\
      \ avoid obstacles\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Path Adjustment with Dynamic Obstacle Count
    code: "MovementPath myPath;\nint obstacleCount = GetNearbyObstacles();\nfloat\
      \ avoidanceRadius = GetUnitSize() * 1.5f;\nbool adjusted = pathOptimizer.AdjustForObstacles(myPath,\
      \ obstacleCount, avoidanceRadius);\nif (!adjusted) {\n    // No adjustments\
      \ made; proceed with original path\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's movement and pathfinding system.
    It may be called iteratively during path generation to refine paths dynamically
    based on real-time obstacle data. Performance can degrade if large avoidance radii
    or many obstacles are present, as more complex calculations are required to compute
    detours.
  warnings: Ensure that the input MovementPath is valid before calling this method;
    otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The method assumes that all waypoints
    in the path are in world coordinates and that obstacle detection has already occurred
    prior to calling this function.
