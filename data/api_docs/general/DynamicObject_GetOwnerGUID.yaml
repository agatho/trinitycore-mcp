  method: GetOwnerGUID
  signature: int DynamicObject::GetOwnerGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the object's owner.
  description: The GetOwnerGUID method returns the globally unique identifier of the
    entity that owns this dynamic object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    dynamic objects are temporary game entities such as area effects, traps, or spell
    visualizations that are associated with a specific caster or owner. This GUID
    is used to track ownership for various gameplay mechanics including spell effects,
    targeting restrictions, and object cleanup. The method does not perform any validation
    on the returned GUID and assumes the object has been properly initialized with
    an owner.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the dynamic object's owner. This
    is typically a 32-bit or 64-bit identifier depending on the internal implementation,
    but is returned as an int for compatibility. Returns 0 if no owner has been set
    or if the owner is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check ownership
    code: "DynamicObject* dynObj = ...; // Assume this is a valid dynamic object\n\
      uint32 ownerGuid = dynObj->GetOwnerGUID();\nif (ownerGuid != 0)\n{\n    // Object\
      \ has an owner, proceed with logic\n    Player* owner = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ ownerGuid));\n    if (owner)\n    {\n        // Use the owner player object\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using owner GUID in spell effect handling
    code: "void HandleAreaEffectSpell(Spell* spell)\n{\n    DynamicObject* dynObj\
      \ = spell->GetCaster()->GetDynObj();\n    if (dynObj)\n    {\n        uint32\
      \ ownerGuid = dynObj->GetOwnerGUID();\n        // Prevent effects from targeting\
      \ the owner or their pets\n        if (ownerGuid == target->GetGUID().GetCounter())\n\
      \        {\n            // Skip processing for owner\n            return;\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID may be zero if the dynamic object was not properly initialized
    with an owner. This method is commonly used in spell effect handling and area
    of effect logic where the caster needs to be identified or excluded from certain
    interactions. The method is thread-safe as it only reads from a stored member
    variable.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without proper validation. If
    the owner has been destroyed or despawned, the GUID may no longer refer to a valid
    object. Always verify that the GUID corresponds to an active entity before attempting
    to access it.
