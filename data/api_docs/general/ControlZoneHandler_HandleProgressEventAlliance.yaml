  method: HandleProgressEventAlliance
  signature: void ControlZoneHandler::HandleProgressEventAlliance(GameObject * controlZone)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a progress event for the Alliance faction within a control zone.
  description: The HandleProgressEventAlliance method is responsible for managing
    and executing game logic associated with progress events triggered by Alliance
    players within a specific control zone. This method typically handles updates
    to faction standings, quest progression, or other alliance-specific mechanics
    when an Alliance player interacts with or enters the control zone. It may also
    update the control zone's state or trigger related events based on the current
    game context and faction dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: controlZone
    description: A pointer to the GameObject representing the control zone that triggered
      the event. This parameter must be a valid GameObject instance of type control
      zone, otherwise undefined behavior may occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterControlZone(Player* player, GameObject* controlZone)\n\
      {\n    if (player->GetTeam() == ALLIANCE)\n    {\n        ControlZoneHandler\
      \ handler;\n        handler.HandleProgressEventAlliance(controlZone);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player interaction or entry into
    a control zone. It assumes that the controlZone parameter is valid and properly
    initialized. The implementation may involve faction-specific state updates, quest
    tracking, or other game logic dependent on the Alliance's presence in the zone.
  warnings: Ensure that the controlZone GameObject passed to this method is valid
    and represents an actual control zone type. Passing a null pointer or incorrect
    GameObject type could lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
