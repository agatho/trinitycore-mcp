  class: Unit
  method: AddChannelObject
  signature: void Unit::AddChannelObject(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a channel object to the unit's channel list.
  description: This method adds a channel object to the unit's channel list, allowing
    the unit to maintain references to channelled objects. It is typically used in
    conjunction with channeling spells or effects that require tracking of channelled
    targets. The method ensures proper handling of channelled objects within the game
    mechanics context, particularly for units that are actively channeling spells
    or abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the channel object to be added. This
      represents the object being channelled and should be a valid GUID from the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Channel Object Addition
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->AddChannelObject(12345);

      // Adds channel object with GUID 12345 to the unit''s channel list'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be called only when the unit is actively channeling an
    object. Implementation details include ensuring that the GUID corresponds to a
    valid channelled target within the game world. Performance considerations include
    avoiding frequent calls during channeling operations, as this may impact memory
    usage and processing time.
  warnings: This method should not be used with invalid or non-existent GUIDs, as
    it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Care must be taken when using this
    method in conjunction with other channel-related methods to avoid conflicts or
    improper handling of channelled objects.
