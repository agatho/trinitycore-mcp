documentation:
  brief: Sets the character bank tab count for the player.
  description: This method configures the number of bank tabs available to the player.
    The character bank tab count determines how many additional bank slots can be
    accessed beyond the default 12 tabs. This method is typically used during character
    creation or when modifying player bank tab access, and affects the player's ability
    to store items in their bank. It directly influences the game mechanics related
    to bank storage and inventory management.
  parameters:
  - name: count
    description: The number of bank tabs to set for the player. Valid values range
      from 0 to 127, where 0 means no additional tabs beyond the default 12, and higher
      values increase the total number of available tabs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting bank tab count to 10
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetCharacterBankTabCount(10);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before the player is fully initialized or during
    character creation. The actual bank tab count may be limited by game mechanics
    and server settings, and changes to this value do not automatically update the
    player's bank UI.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect bank tab counts, potentially
    causing issues with bank storage or inventory management. Care should be taken
    when setting values above 127 as it may exceed game limits.
