  class: BehaviorManager
  method: GetUpdateInterval
  signature: uint32 BehaviorManager::GetUpdateInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update interval in milliseconds used by the behavior manager
    for AI processing.
  description: The GetUpdateInterval method retrieves the time interval, measured
    in milliseconds, that determines how frequently the BehaviorManager updates its
    AI behaviors. This value is crucial for controlling the frequency of AI decision-making
    and action execution within the game world. The returned interval is typically
    configured based on the specific behavior type or NPC type and ensures consistent
    timing across different AI components. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the update interval in milliseconds. This indicates
    how often the behavior manager should process AI updates for the associated NPC
    or object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 interval = behaviorManager->GetUpdateInterval();

      TC_LOG_INFO("ai", "Behavior update interval is %u ms", interval);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Interval in AI Loop
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_updateTimer <= diff)\n \
      \   {\n        uint32 interval = m_behaviorManager->GetUpdateInterval();\n \
      \       // Perform AI logic here\n        m_updateTimer = interval;\n    }\n\
      \    else\n    {\n        m_updateTimer -= diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The update interval returned by this method directly affects performance
    and responsiveness of NPC behaviors. Lower intervals provide more responsive AI
    but increase CPU usage. This value is typically set during initialization or configuration
    of the behavior manager and should remain consistent throughout the object's lifetime.
