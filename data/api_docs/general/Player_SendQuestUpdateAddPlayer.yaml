  class: Player
  method: SendQuestUpdateAddPlayer
  signature: void Player::SendQuestUpdateAddPlayer(const Quest * quest, uint16 newCount)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a quest update packet to the player indicating that a quest has been
    added or updated with a new count.
  description: The SendQuestUpdateAddPlayer method is used in TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft server implementation to notify a player's client about an update
    to a quest they are tracking. This typically occurs when a player's progress on
    a quest changes, such as when they collect items or defeat enemies required for
    the quest. The method sends a specific packet to the player's client that updates
    the quest status in their quest log. It is part of the core quest system and ensures
    that players receive real-time feedback about their quest progress. This method
    is usually called internally by the server when quest objectives are modified,
    rather than being invoked directly by scripts or other systems.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: A pointer to the Quest object that has been updated. This parameter
      must not be null and should point to a valid quest that the player is tracking.
  - name: newCount
    description: The new count value for the quest objective. This represents how
      many of the required items or kills have been collected/achieved by the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when updating quest progress
    code: "void UpdatePlayerQuestProgress(Player* player, const Quest* quest, uint16\
      \ count)\n{\n    if (player && quest)\n    {\n        player->SendQuestUpdateAddPlayer(quest,\
      \ count);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server's quest management
    system when quest progress changes. It directly sends a network packet to the
    player's client, so it should only be used when the player is connected and the
    quest is actively being tracked. The method does not validate whether the player
    actually has the quest in their log - that check should be handled by calling
    code.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is connected to ensure
    the packet is sent properly. Calling this method on a disconnected player will
    result in no action. Additionally, passing null pointers for the quest parameter
    can cause crashes or undefined behavior.
