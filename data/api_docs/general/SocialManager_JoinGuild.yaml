  class: SocialManager
  method: JoinGuild
  signature: bool SocialManager::JoinGuild(Guild * guild)
documentation:
  brief: Joins the specified guild for the player associated with this social manager
    instance.
  description: The JoinGuild method attempts to add the player represented by the
    SocialManager instance to the specified guild. This method typically handles the
    necessary game logic such as checking guild membership limits, verifying player
    eligibility, and updating internal player and guild data structures. It is commonly
    used when a player accepts an invitation to join a guild or when a guild leader
    invites a player. The method returns true upon successful guild enrollment, and
    false if the operation fails due to various conditions like guild limits, player
    already being in a guild, or invalid guild state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully added to the guild, false otherwise.
    Failure can occur due to reasons such as the player already being in a guild,
    guild capacity limits reached, or invalid guild object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Join Usage
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildById(12345);\nif (myGuild)\n{\n   \
      \ bool success = socialManager->JoinGuild(myGuild);\n    if (success)\n    \
      \    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"Successfully joined\
      \ the guild.\");\n    else\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Failed to join the guild.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already been validated for joining
    the guild (e.g., accepted an invitation). It does not perform any validation on
    the Guild pointer itself, so it's expected that the caller ensures the guild is
    valid and active. The actual guild join process may also trigger additional events
    or updates in the game state.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the player can legally join
    the guild (e.g., checking for existing guild membership) may result in unexpected
    behavior or client-side errors. Also, ensure that the Guild pointer passed is
    valid and not null to avoid undefined behavior.
