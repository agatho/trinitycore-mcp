documentation:
  brief: Resets all formation metrics to their default values
  description: The Reset method clears and reinitializes all internal counters, timers,
    and statistical data within the FormationMetrics class. This method is typically
    invoked when a new formation needs to be established or when existing formation
    data should be discarded to start fresh. The reset operation ensures that all
    metrics are returned to their initial state, effectively clearing any accumulated
    data from previous formations. This is commonly used during mob AI behavior transitions,
    formation reassignment, or when cleaning up after combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'FormationMetrics metrics;

      metrics.Reset(); // Clears all formation statistics'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before New Formation Setup
    code: 'FormationMetrics* formationMetrics = GetFormationMetrics();

      formationMetrics->Reset();

      // Set up new formation parameters after reset

      SetupNewFormation(formationMetrics);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete reset of all internal metrics and should
    not be called during active formation processing as it may invalidate ongoing
    calculations. The reset operation is lightweight and does not involve memory allocation
    or deallocation.
  warnings: Calling Reset() while another thread is actively using the FormationMetrics
    object may result in inconsistent data states. Ensure proper synchronization when
    using this method in multi-threaded contexts.
