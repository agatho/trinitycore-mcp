  method: AI_Destroy
  signature: void Conversation::AI_Destroy()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the conversation AI instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The AI_Destroy method is responsible for properly cleaning up and destroying
    the AI component of a conversation object within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method ensures that all dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the
    conversation's AI behavior are released, preventing memory leaks and ensuring
    proper object lifecycle management. The method is typically invoked when a conversation
    needs to be terminated or removed from the game world, such as when a player exits
    a dialogue or when the conversation has completed its intended sequence. It performs
    necessary cleanup operations including but not limited to releasing references
    to associated NPCs, clearing internal AI state variables, and notifying any subscribed
    systems about the destruction event.

  returns: void

  - title: Basic Usage in Conversation Cleanup
    code: "void HandleConversationEnd(Conversation* conv)\n{\n    if (conv)\n    {\n\
      \        conv->AI_Destroy();\n        delete conv;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid conversation objects that have
    been properly initialized. It is recommended to check for null pointers before
    calling AI_Destroy to avoid undefined behavior. The destruction process may involve
    multiple internal steps including state cleanup, reference invalidation, and event
    notifications.
  warnings: Calling AI_Destroy on an already destroyed or uninitialized conversation
    object may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure the conversation
    object is in a valid state before invoking this method. Avoid calling AI_Destroy
    from within other AI callbacks as it might cause recursive destruction scenarios.
