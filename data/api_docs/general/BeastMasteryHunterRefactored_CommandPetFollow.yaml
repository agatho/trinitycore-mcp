documentation:
  brief: Commands the hunter's pet to begin following the hunter.
  description: The CommandPetFollow method initiates the pet following behavior for
    a Beast Mastery hunter. When invoked, it instructs the hunter's pet to move to
    and remain near the hunter's position. This method is typically called when the
    player issues a 'follow' command through the UI or game mechanics, and it affects
    the pet's movement state and AI behavior. The method does not return any value
    and operates directly on the pet's current state within the game world.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BeastMasteryHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.CommandPetFollow();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's AI state machine to transition
    it into a 'follow' mode. It may also update the pet's movement flags and target
    tracking behavior.
