documentation:
  brief: Removes all registered interaction handlers from the manager.
  description: The CleanupHandlers method is responsible for cleaning up and removing
    all currently registered interaction handlers from the InteractionManager. This
    method ensures that no stale or invalid handlers remain in the system, which helps
    prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior during interaction processing. It
    typically gets invoked during object destruction or cleanup phases to properly
    dispose of all associated handler resources. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs its operation on the internal collection of registered handlers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cleanup Usage
    code: 'InteractionManager manager;

      // ... register some handlers ...

      manager.CleanupHandlers(); // Remove all handlers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying an InteractionManager instance
    to ensure proper resource cleanup. It's typically not called manually in normal
    gameplay flow but rather as part of the manager's lifecycle management.
