  class: InstanceScript
  method: LoadDoorData
  signature: void InstanceScript::LoadDoorData(const DoorData * data)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes door data for an instance script, setting up door states and
    associated GUIDs.
  description: The LoadDoorData method is used to initialize and configure door-related
    data within an InstanceScript. This method typically takes a pointer to a DoorData
    array which contains information about doors in the instance, such as their GUIDs,
    states, and associated triggers. It's commonly called during the initialization
    phase of an instance to ensure that all doors are properly registered with the
    script and can be managed correctly throughout the instance lifecycle. The method
    does not return any value but modifies internal state of the InstanceScript to
    track door information.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an array of DoorData structures that define the doors
      in the instance, including their GUIDs and initial states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic door data initialization
    code: "class ExampleInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    ExampleInstanceScript(Map*\
      \ map) : InstanceScript(map) {}\n\n    void Initialize() override\n    {\n \
      \       static const DoorData doors[] =\n        {\n            {12345, 12346,\
      \ DOOR_TYPE_ROOM, 0},\n            {12347, 12348, DOOR_TYPE_ROOM, 0},\n    \
      \        {0, 0, DOOR_TYPE_ROOM, 0}\n        };\n        LoadDoorData(doors);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the instance initialization
    phase. Door data is usually defined in a static array that's passed to this function.
    The DoorData structure contains GUIDs for both door and gothic door objects, as
    well as type information.
  warnings: Ensure that all door GUIDs referenced in the DoorData array are valid
    and exist in the database. Incorrect or missing GUIDs can lead to doors not functioning
    properly or causing runtime errors.
