  class: LootCoordination
  method: SetLootCoordinationTimeout
  signature: void LootCoordination::SetLootCoordinationTimeout(uint32 groupId, uint32
    timeoutMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the timeout duration for a specific loot coordination group.
  description: This method configures the timeout period in milliseconds for a given
    loot coordination group. When a loot item is being coordinated among group members,
    this timeout determines how long the system will wait before automatically resolving
    the loot assignment if no explicit decision is made by the participants. The timeout
    applies to the specified group ID and affects all loot coordination activities
    within that group context. This mechanism ensures that loot distribution does
    not stall indefinitely in cases where players fail to make a decision or are unresponsive.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the loot coordination group for which the
      timeout is being set. This ID typically corresponds to a specific group or raid
      instance within the game world.
  - name: timeoutMs
    description: The timeout duration in milliseconds for the loot coordination group.
      Values should be positive integers representing time intervals; typical values
      may range from several seconds to minutes depending on game design requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Timeout for Group ID 12345
    code: LootCoordination::SetLootCoordinationTimeout(12345, 30000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Timeout Based on Raid Difficulty
    code: 'uint32 timeout = IsRaidDifficulty() ? 60000 : 30000;

      LootCoordination::SetLootCoordinationTimeout(GetCurrentGroupId(), timeout);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during group loot setup or configuration phases.
    The timeout value should be carefully chosen to balance between responsiveness
    and allowing sufficient time for player interaction, especially in high-stakes
    raid scenarios where quick loot decisions are critical.
  warnings: Setting very short timeouts may result in premature loot resolution, potentially
    causing disputes or unintended loot distribution. Ensure that the timeout values
    align with expected player response times and game flow mechanics.
