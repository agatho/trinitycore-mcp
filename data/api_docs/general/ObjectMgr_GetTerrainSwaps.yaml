  signature: const int & ObjectMgr::GetTerrainSwaps() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the terrain swaps configuration data used by the game
    world.
  description: The GetTerrainSwaps method retrieves a constant reference to an integer
    value that represents terrain swap configurations within the TrinityCore instance.
    This configuration typically controls how terrain data is handled or swapped during
    world loading and gameplay, particularly relevant for custom maps or terrain modifications.
    The returned reference allows access to the current terrain swap settings without
    copying the underlying data. This method is generally used internally by the core
    systems to manage terrain-related operations and should not be modified directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the terrain swaps configuration
    value. The actual meaning of this integer depends on the internal implementation
    and may represent a bitmask, index, or flag set related to terrain swapping behavior
    in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Terrain Swaps Configuration
    code: "const int& terrainSwaps = sObjectMgr->GetTerrainSwaps();\n// Use terrainSwaps\
      \ for further processing\nif (terrainSwaps > 0)\n{\n    // Perform actions based\
      \ on terrain swap configuration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal data member, so modifications
    to the returned value will not affect the actual terrain swaps configuration.
    The value is typically initialized during server startup or map loading and remains
    constant throughout runtime unless explicitly changed by administrative commands
    or code.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned reference directly as it may lead to undefined
    behavior. This method should only be used for reading the current terrain swap
    settings, not for altering them.
