  class: TargetSelectionUtils
  method: IsGoodInterruptTarget
  signature: bool TargetSelectionUtils::IsGoodInterruptTarget(Unit * target, Player
    * interrupter)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit is a valid candidate for interruption of
    spell casting by a player.
  description: The IsGoodInterruptTarget method evaluates whether a given Unit target
    is suitable for being interrupted by a Player's interrupt ability. This function
    checks various conditions such as the target's current spell state, faction relationship,
    and whether the target is currently casting a spell that can be interrupted. It
    ensures that only appropriate targets are considered for interruption mechanics
    within the game's combat system. The method respects game rules around friendly
    fire, non-interruptible spells, and valid targeting criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being evaluated as a potential
      interrupt target. Must not be null.
  - name: interrupter
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is attempting to interrupt the target.
      Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is a valid interrupt candidate, false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that the target is currently casting an interruptible
    spell and meets all necessary conditions for interruption by the given player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a target can be interrupted
    code: "if (TargetSelectionUtils::IsGoodInterruptTarget(targetUnit, player)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with interrupting the target's spell\n    player->InterruptSpell(PROJECTILE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a spell interruption logic flow
    code: "void Player::HandleInterruptSpell(Unit* target) {\n    if (IsGoodInterruptTarget(target,\
      \ this)) {\n        if (target->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING)) {\n      \
      \      target->InterruptNonMeleeSpells(true);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the core spell interruption system.
    It performs checks on the target's current spell state, faction status, and whether
    it's a valid combat target. The function assumes that both parameters are non-null
    and properly initialized before being passed to it.
  warnings: Ensure that both the target and interrupter parameters are valid pointers
    before calling this method. Passing null pointers may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Additionally, this function does not validate if the player actually
    has an interrupt ability available; it only determines if the target is a suitable
    candidate.
