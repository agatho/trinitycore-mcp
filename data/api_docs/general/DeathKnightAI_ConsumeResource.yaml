  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void DeathKnightAI::ConsumeResource(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified resource for a Death Knight AI spell.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is used within the DeathKnightAI class to
    deduct the required resources (such as runes, energy, or other spell-specific
    requirements) from a Death Knight's available resource pool when a spell is cast.
    This method ensures proper resource management in accordance with World of Warcraft's
    Death Knight class mechanics, particularly for abilities that consume specific
    resources like Blood, Frost, or Unholy Runes. The method typically handles internal
    state updates and may trigger additional effects based on the consumed resource
    type and the spell ID provided.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast. This determines which
      resources are consumed and how the resource consumption is handled within the
      Death Knight's resource system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "void MyDeathKnightAI::CastFrostStrike()\n{\n    // Cast a frost strike\
      \ which consumes frost runes\n    ConsumeResource(49143); // Frost Strike spell\
      \ ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming Multiple Resources
    code: "void MyDeathKnightAI::CastBloodBoil()\n{\n    // Blood Boil consumes both\
      \ blood and unholy runes\n    ConsumeResource(49184); // Blood Boil spell ID\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a Death
    Knight casts a spell. It assumes that the spell ID corresponds to a valid Death
    Knight ability that consumes resources, and it updates the internal resource counters
    accordingly. The method may also trigger visual or auditory feedback in the client
    depending on how the resource consumption is implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId passed to this method is valid for a Death Knight
    class spell, otherwise unexpected behavior or errors may occur. This method should
    not be called outside of proper AI logic as it modifies internal state without
    validation.
