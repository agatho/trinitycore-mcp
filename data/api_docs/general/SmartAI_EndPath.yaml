  class: SmartAI
  method: EndPath
  signature: void SmartAI::EndPath(bool fail)
documentation:
  brief: Completes the current path execution and triggers associated AI events.
  description: The EndPath method terminates the active path movement for a SmartAI-controlled
    creature, signaling the end of path-based behavior. It can optionally mark the
    path as failed, which may trigger specific failure handling routines within the
    AI system. This method is typically invoked when a creature has reached its destination
    or when path execution needs to be explicitly terminated. The method ensures proper
    cleanup of path-related data and can initiate subsequent AI actions based on the
    fail parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: fail
    description: When true, indicates that the path execution failed and triggers
      failure-specific AI behaviors. When false, signifies successful completion of
      the path.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Completion
    code: "void OnMovementInform(uint32 type, uint32 id) override\n{\n    if (type\
      \ == POINT_MOTION_TYPE && id == 1)\n    {\n        // Path to point 1 completed\
      \ successfully\n        me->GetAI()->EndPath(false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Failed Path Execution
    code: "void MovementInform(uint32 type, uint32 id) override\n{\n    if (type ==\
      \ POINT_MOTION_TYPE && id == 2)\n    {\n        // Path to point 2 failed\n\
      \        me->GetAI()->EndPath(true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the SmartAI context and during
    active path execution. It's designed to work in conjunction with other AI methods
    like StartPath, and improper usage may lead to inconsistent AI behavior or memory
    leaks.
  warnings: Calling EndPath without a matching StartPath invocation can cause undefined
    behavior. The fail parameter should be used carefully as it affects subsequent
    AI decision-making logic.
