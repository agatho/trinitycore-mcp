documentation:
  brief: Completes a loot session by processing and distributing loot to players in
    the coordination.
  description: The CompleteLootSession method finalizes a loot session identified
    by the provided lootSessionId. It handles the distribution of items to players
    who participated in the loot roll, updates player inventory, and cleans up internal
    session data structures. This method is typically invoked when all loot rolls
    have been completed and the final loot distribution needs to be finalized. The
    method ensures that each player receives their appropriate loot based on the loot
    rules and rolling decisions made during the session.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot Session Completion
    code: 'LootCoordination lootCoord;

      uint32 sessionId = 12345;

      lootCoord.CompleteLootSession(sessionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after all loot rolls have been processed
    and the session is ready to be finalized. It assumes that the loot session data
    is valid and properly initialized. The method may perform database operations
    to update player inventories and session state.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that all loot rolls are complete
    may result in incomplete or incorrect loot distribution. This method should not
    be called concurrently with other methods modifying the same loot session data.
