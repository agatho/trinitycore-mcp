  brief: Determines whether a Creature is a quest giver.
  description: The IsQuestGiver method checks if the specified Creature object is
    capable of offering quests to players. This determination is based on the creature's
    flags, entries, and other internal properties that define its role in the game's
    quest system. The method returns true if the NPC can initiate or provide quests,
    and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for proper quest interaction
    handling within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Creature is a valid quest giver; otherwise returns
    false.

      \ npc->GetGUID());\n}"

  notes: This method relies on internal NPC flags and database entries to determine
