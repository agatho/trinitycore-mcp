  signature: void QuestPickup::UpdateQuestGiverAvailability()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the availability status of quest givers for the player.
  description: The UpdateQuestGiverAvailability method refreshes the quest giver status
    for all active quests in the player's quest log. It evaluates whether each quest
    giver is currently available to provide quest updates or completions based on
    the player's current location, quest progress, and game state. This method ensures
    that quest givers properly reflect their availability in the user interface and
    that players can interact with them appropriately. The update typically occurs
    when a player enters a new zone, completes a quest, or when the game state changes
    in a way that might affect quest giver availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest handling
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest)\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    _questPickup->UpdateQuestGiverAvailability();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage after zone change
    code: "void Player::OnMapChanged()\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n    _questPickup->UpdateQuestGiverAvailability();\n\
      \    // This ensures quest givers in the new zone are properly updated\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop and should
    not usually be invoked directly by custom modules. It may trigger UI updates for
    quest givers, so performance considerations should be taken into account if called
    frequently. The method does not return any value but modifies internal state related
    to quest giver availability.
  warnings: Calling this method manually outside of the expected game flow may cause
    unexpected behavior in quest giver availability or UI updates. It's recommended
    to only call this method when necessary, such as after significant player state
    changes.
