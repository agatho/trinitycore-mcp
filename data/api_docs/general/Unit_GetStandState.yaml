  method: GetStandState
  signature: UnitStandStateType Unit::GetStandState() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current stand state of the unit, indicating whether it is standing,
    sitting, or in a different position.
  description: The GetStandState method retrieves the current stand state of a Unit
    object, which represents the physical position of the unit in the game world.
    This method is commonly used to determine if a unit is standing, sitting, or in
    other states such as kneeling or lying down. The returned value corresponds to
    specific UnitStandStateType enums that define the unit's posture. Understanding
    this state is crucial for various game mechanics including combat, movement, and
    interaction with objects. The method can be called on any Unit instance, including
    players, NPCs, or pets, and returns a consistent stand state value based on the
    unit's current physical condition.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a UnitStandStateType enum value that represents the current standing
    state of the unit. Possible values include Standing, Sitting, kneeling, lying
    down, or other states depending on the unit's posture. The return value is always
    valid and never null, as it directly corresponds to the unit's physical state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "UnitStandStateType state = unit->GetStandState();\nif (state == UNIT_STAND_STATE_STANDING)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is standing\n}\nelse if (state == UNIT_ST stand_STATE_SITTING)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is sitting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and does not require any special conditions to
    execute. It simply returns the current state of the unit without modifying anything,
    making it safe for use in both player and NPC contexts. Performance-wise, this
    method has minimal overhead as it directly accesses a stored value.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a unit is currently standing
    or sitting in combat situations, as other factors like movement or animation may
    override the stand state. Also, be cautious when using this method for non-player
    units, as some NPCs might have different stand states based on their behavior
    or AI.
