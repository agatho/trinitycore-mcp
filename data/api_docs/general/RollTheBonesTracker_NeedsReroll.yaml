  class: RollTheBonesTracker
  method: NeedsReroll
  signature: bool RollTheBonesTracker::NeedsReroll() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a RollTheBonesTracker instance requires a reroll operation.
  description: The NeedsReroll method evaluates the current state of the RollTheBonesTracker
    to determine if a reroll is necessary. This typically occurs in the context of
    World of Warcraft's Roll the Bones legendary ability, where certain conditions
    must be met before allowing another roll. The method checks internal flags or
    counters that track the state of the tracker and returns true if a reroll operation
    should be performed, otherwise false. It is commonly used within game logic to
    enforce cooldowns or progression requirements for the Roll the Bones mechanic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the tracker requires a reroll operation based on its internal
    state; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Logic
    code: "if (tracker.NeedsReroll()) {\n    // Perform reroll logic here\n    tracker.PerformReroll();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Action Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerRollAction(Player* player) {\n    RollTheBonesTracker&\
      \ tracker = player->GetRollTheBonesTracker();\n    if (tracker.NeedsReroll())\
      \ {\n        // Validate and execute reroll\n        if (CanPerformReroll(player))\
      \ {\n            tracker.PerformReroll();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during gameplay, so performance
    should be considered. The implementation likely involves checking internal state
    flags rather than complex calculations. It may be used in conjunction with other
    methods like GetRollCount() or IsOnCooldown().
  warnings: Ensure that the tracker object is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. This method does not modify the tracker's
    state; it only reads it.
