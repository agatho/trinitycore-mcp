    playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the farming statistics for a specified player by their GUID.
  description: The GetPlayerStatistics method retrieves the complete farming statistics
    record associated with a given player's unique identifier (GUID). This method
    is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's farming mechanics,
    where players can accumulate various statistics related to their agricultural
    activities such as crops planted, harvested, and other farming-related achievements.
    The returned reference points to an immutable FarmingStatistics object that contains
    all relevant data for the specified player. The method assumes that the player
    GUID is valid and corresponds to an existing player in the database. If no statistics
    exist for the given player, the behavior may vary depending on implementation,
    but typically it would return a default or empty statistics object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a FarmingStatistics object containing all farming-related
    data for the specified player. The returned object is immutable and should not
    be modified directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      const FarmingStatistics& stats = coordinator.GetPlayerStatistics(playerId);

      uint32 totalCropsPlanted = stats.GetTotalCropsPlanted();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Player Statistics
    code: "uint32 playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nconst FarmingStatistics&\
      \ stats = coordinator.GetPlayerStatistics(playerId);\nif (stats.GetTotalCropsHarvested()\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    // Award farming achievement\n    player->RewardAchievement(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal caching or database lookups
    to efficiently retrieve player statistics. It's important to note that the returned
    reference is const, ensuring data integrity and preventing unintended modifications.
    The method should be thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded environment like
    TrinityCore's server architecture.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided player GUID is valid and corresponds to an actual
    player in the database; otherwise, behavior may be undefined or result in errors.
    Since this returns a const reference, modifying the returned object directly will
    cause compilation errors, which is intentional for data safety.
