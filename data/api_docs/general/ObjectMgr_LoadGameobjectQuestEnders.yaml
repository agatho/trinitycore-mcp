  brief: Loads and initializes game object quest ender data from the database.
  description: The LoadGameobjectQuestEnders method is responsible for loading all
    game object entries that are associated with quest enders from the database into
    memory. This method ensures that the game world knows which game objects can complete
    quests, typically by linking them to specific quest requirements or objectives.
    It is part of the ObjectMgr class's initialization process and is called during
    server startup or reload operations. The method populates internal data structures
    used by the quest system to determine when a quest has been completed via interaction
    with a game object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadGameobjectQuestEnders();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reloads,
    and it's crucial for proper quest functionality. It relies on the database tables
    containing quest-related game object associations. The method does not return
    any value but modifies internal state of the ObjectMgr singleton.
