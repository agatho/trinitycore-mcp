documentation:
  brief: Updates object visibility when a temporary summon is destroyed.
  description: The UpdateObjectVisibilityOnDestroy method is responsible for managing
    the visibility state of objects associated with a temporary summon when that summon
    is being destroyed. This method ensures that any creatures, game objects, or other
    entities linked to the summon are properly notified and updated in terms of their
    visibility status within the game world. It typically handles cleanup operations
    related to object visibility, such as removing the summon from player views, updating
    AI states, or triggering relevant events that depend on the summon's destruction.
    This method is automatically invoked during the destruction process of temporary
    summons, particularly when they expire or are explicitly removed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in summon destruction
    code: "void MySummon::OnDespawn()\n{\n    // This method is called internally\
      \ when the summon is destroyed\n    UpdateObjectVisibilityOnDestroy();\n}\n\n\
      // The above example shows how this method would be invoked during a custom\
      \ summon's destruction logic."
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal lifecycle management for temporary summons
    in TrinityCore. It should not typically be called manually unless implementing
    custom summon behavior. The method may interact with visibility systems, AI, and
    object linking mechanisms within the core game engine.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand its internal dependencies
    and implications. Incorrect usage can lead to visibility glitches or memory leaks
    in the game world.
