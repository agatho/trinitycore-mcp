documentation:
  brief: Moves an AchievementGlobalMgr object, transferring ownership of its resources
    to the target object.
  description: The move assignment operator for AchievementGlobalMgr transfers all
    managed resources from the source object to the target object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where an existing AchievementGlobalMgr instance
    needs to be replaced with another instance's data without performing deep copies.
    The method ensures efficient resource management by moving internal data structures
    rather than copying them, which is particularly beneficial for performance-critical
    systems like World of Warcraft's achievement tracking system. After the move,
    the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target AchievementGlobalMgr object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'AchievementGlobalMgr mgr1;

      AchievementGlobalMgr mgr2 = std::move(mgr1); // Move-assign mgr1 to mgr2

      // mgr1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<AchievementGlobalMgr> managers;

      managers.emplace_back();

      AchievementGlobalMgr newMgr;

      managers[0] = std::move(newMgr); // Move-assign newMgr to first element

      // newMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics standard and should be used
    when transferring ownership of resources. The moved-from object remains valid
    but its contents are unspecified, so any further operations on it should be avoided
    unless explicitly documented otherwise. In TrinityCore's context, this method
    likely manages achievement data structures efficiently during server operations.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source object should not be used for
    any operations that depend on its previous state. The moved-from object is left
    in a valid but unspecified state and may contain garbage data or invalid references.
