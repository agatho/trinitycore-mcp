documentation:
  brief: Checks if a message is classified as spam in the social system
  description: The IsSpam method determines whether a given message should be treated
    as spam based on predefined criteria within the TrinityCore social manager. This
    functionality helps prevent abuse and maintain chat quality by filtering out unwanted
    or repetitive messages. The method evaluates the content of the message against
    internal spam detection rules, which may include pattern matching, frequency analysis,
    and other heuristic checks. It is typically used in conjunction with chat handling
    systems to automatically block or flag potentially harmful messages before they
    are displayed to other players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the message is classified as spam according to the social
    manager's rules; otherwise returns false if the message passes spam detection
    checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spam Check
    code: "if (socialManager.IsSpam(\"Buy cheap pills now!\")) {\n    // Message flagged\
      \ as spam\n    player->SendNotification(\"Your message was blocked as spam.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Message allowed through\n    SendChatMessage(player, \"\
      Buy cheap pills now!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a combination of blacklisted words,
    message frequency thresholds, and pattern recognition algorithms. It's important
    to note that the spam detection rules may be configurable via game configuration
    files or database entries in a live TrinityCore environment.
  warnings: The spam detection algorithm might not be perfect and could potentially
    flag legitimate messages as spam, especially if they contain common words or phrases
    used in normal gameplay. Developers should consider implementing user feedback
    mechanisms to adjust spam filters based on actual player behavior.
