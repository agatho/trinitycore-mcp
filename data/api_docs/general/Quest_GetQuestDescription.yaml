  class: Quest
  method: GetQuestDescription
  signature: const std::string & Quest::GetQuestDescription() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the quest description text for the current quest object
  description: The GetQuestDescription method retrieves the textual description associated
    with a quest in the TrinityCore database. This description is typically used to
    display quest information to players and represents the main narrative content
    of the quest. The method returns a const reference to a std::string, ensuring
    that the returned text cannot be modified while maintaining thread safety. It's
    commonly used in conjunction with other quest-related methods to provide comprehensive
    quest information to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to a std::string containing the quest description
    text. This string may be empty if no description exists for the quest, or may
    contain the full descriptive text that defines the quest's purpose and content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Quest* quest = player->GetQuestTemplate();

      std::string description = quest->GetQuestDescription();

      // Use description in quest display logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used within the context
    of a valid quest object. The returned string is read-only and cannot be modified
    directly. Performance considerations are minimal as this method simply returns
    a reference to existing data.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned string may be empty if no description exists
    for the quest, which could lead to display issues if not handled properly in UI
    code. Also note that this method should only be called on valid quest objects,
    otherwise it may cause undefined behavior.
