  method: Unload
  signature: void InstanceLockMgr::Unload()
documentation:
  brief: Unloads all instance lock data from memory, clearing active locks and releasing
    associated resources.
  description: The Unload method in InstanceLockMgr is responsible for gracefully
    shutting down and cleaning up all active instance locks within the TrinityCore
    server. This method ensures that any pending or active instance lock information
    is properly cleared from memory, preventing potential memory leaks or stale data
    references. It typically gets invoked during server shutdown or when resetting
    instance lock states. The method does not take any parameters and performs no
    return operations, making it a simple cleanup utility. During execution, the method
    likely iterates through all registered instance locks and removes them from internal
    tracking structures, ensuring that no locks persist beyond their intended lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Shutdown
    code: "void WorldServer::OnShutdown()\n{\n    sInstanceLockMgr->Unload();\n  \
      \  // Proceed with other shutdown procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a state where no
    active instance locks are being processed. Calling Unload while instance lock
    operations are ongoing may lead to inconsistent states or data corruption.
  warnings: Improper use of this method during active gameplay sessions can result
    in players being unable to enter instances correctly, as all lock information
    will be cleared without proper cleanup of player state.
