  class: BalanceDruidRefactored
  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void BalanceDruidRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buffs and debuffs for the Balance Druid character.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing the
    state of all buffs and debuffs currently affecting the Balance Druid class. This
    includes checking buff expiration times, applying new buff effects, removing expired
    or invalid buffs, and ensuring that the druid's aura state remains consistent
    with game mechanics. The method typically runs during each update cycle to maintain
    accurate status effects on the player character. It may also handle interactions
    between different buffs, such as stacking rules or conflicting effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void GameUpdate()\n{\n    // Other update logic...\n    balanceDruid.UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat System
    code: "void BalanceDruidRefactored::OnCombatUpdate()\n{\n    // Handle combat-specific\
      \ buff logic\n    UpdateBuffs();\n    // Apply damage calculations based on\
      \ current buffs\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to ensure accurate
    buff states. It may internally iterate through a list of active auras and perform
    state checks for each one. The implementation likely uses TrinityCore's aura system
    to manage buff durations and effects.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method could lead to incorrect buff states,
    which might affect gameplay balance or cause unexpected behavior in combat scenarios.
    Ensure that all buff-related logic is properly synchronized with the game's time-based
    systems.
