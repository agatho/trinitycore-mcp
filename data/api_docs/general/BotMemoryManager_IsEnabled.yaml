  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool BotMemoryManager::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot memory manager is enabled and active in the current
    session.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the BotMemoryManager subsystem is
    currently active and functional within the TrinityCore instance. This check is
    typically used to verify that memory management for AI bots has been properly
    initialized and is ready to handle bot-specific data structures and caching operations.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating the operational state of the memory
    manager, which can be crucial for conditional logic in bot behavior scripts or
    system initialization routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotMemoryManager is enabled and operational; otherwise,
    returns false when the manager is disabled or not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (BotMemoryManager::Instance()->IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with bot\
      \ memory operations\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Bot memory manager is enabled\"\
      );\n} else {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Bot memory manager is disabled\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and should not introduce significant
    performance overhead. It's recommended to cache the result of this call if it's
    used frequently within tight loops or high-frequency operations.
