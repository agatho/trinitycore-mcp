documentation:
  brief: Resets all threat metrics to their initial state, clearing accumulated threat
    data for NPCs and players.
  description: The ThreatMetrics::Reset method clears all stored threat values and
    associated data within the threat system. This function is typically invoked when
    resetting a creature's threat table or during combat initialization to ensure
    clean threat tracking. It resets internal counters, clears threat lists, and prepares
    the metrics for new threat calculations. The method does not affect the underlying
    creature or player objects but solely resets their threat-related statistics.

  - title: Reset Threat Metrics for a Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      ThreatMetrics& metrics = creature->GetThreatManager().GetThreatMetrics();

      metrics.Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully during active combat as it may disrupt
    ongoing threat calculations. It is recommended to call this only when a new combat
    phase begins or when resetting creature behavior.
