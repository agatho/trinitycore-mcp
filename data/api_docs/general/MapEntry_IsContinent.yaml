  signature: bool MapEntry::IsContinent() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map represented by this entry is a continent.
  description: The IsContinent method checks if the current MapEntry represents a
    continent within the World of Warcraft world. In TrinityCore, maps are categorized
    into different types including continents, instances, battlegrounds, and others.
    This method returns true if the map's type indicates it is a continent, which
    typically means it serves as a primary geographical area where players can explore
    and interact with the game world. The check is based on internal map type flags
    or configuration data stored in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is a continent; otherwise returns false. A continent
    map usually corresponds to major regions like Azeroth, Kalimdor, or other primary
    world areas.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a MapEntry represents a continent
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(0); // Map ID 0 is Eastern Kingdoms\n\
      if (entry->IsContinent()) {\n    printf(\"This map is a continent.\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"This map is not a continent.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal map type definitions and may vary depending
    on the game version or custom configurations. It's commonly used in zone-based
    logic, player movement restrictions, and area trigger systems.
