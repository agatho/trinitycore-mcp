documentation:
  brief: Optimizes bot performance by managing resource allocation and lifecycle events.
  description: The OptimizePerformance method in BotLifecycleMgr is responsible for
    maintaining efficient operation of AI-controlled bots within the TrinityCore environment.
    It performs internal optimizations such as adjusting bot behavior based on server
    load, managing memory usage, and coordinating lifecycle events to prevent performance
    degradation. This method typically runs periodically or in response to system
    events to ensure that bot operations remain within acceptable resource thresholds
    without compromising gameplay experience.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::instance()->OptimizePerformance();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the core system at regular
    intervals. Developers should not call this directly unless implementing custom
    bot lifecycle management logic.
