  class: IBotSessionManager
  method: GetSession
  signature: std::shared_ptr<IBotSession> IBotSessionManager::GetSession(uint32 accountId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a bot session associated with the specified account ID.
  description: The GetSession method retrieves a shared pointer to an IBotSession
    object that corresponds to the given account ID. This method is typically used
    within the TrinityCore framework to manage and access bot sessions for automated
    player behaviors. The returned session may be null if no active session exists
    for the specified account. Sessions are managed internally by the bot system and
    are usually created when a bot logs in or is initialized. This method does not
    modify any state but provides read-only access to existing bot sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account for which to retrieve the bot
      session. Must be a valid, non-zero account ID that has been registered with
      the bot system.
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<IBotSession> pointing to the bot session associated with
    the specified account ID. Returns nullptr if no session exists for the given account
    ID or if the account ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nstd::shared_ptr<IBotSession> session = sessionManager->GetSession(accountId);\n\
      if (session)\n{\n    // Use the session\n    session->DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "uint32 accountId = 0;\nstd::shared_ptr<IBotSession> session = sessionManager->GetSession(accountId);\n\
      if (!session)\n{\n    // Handle case where no session exists\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      No bot session found for account %u\", accountId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads concurrently.
    The returned shared_ptr should not be stored long-term unless proper reference
    counting is maintained to prevent dangling pointers. Internally, this method likely
    uses a map or similar data structure for O(1) lookup of sessions by account ID.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or zero account ID may return a null
    pointer, which must be checked before dereferencing. Improper handling of returned
    session pointers can lead to memory leaks or access violations if not properly
    managed with shared_ptr semantics.
