api:
  class: InstanceEvent
  method: RaidInfoReceived
  signature: InstanceEvent InstanceEvent::RaidInfoReceived(int playerGuid, uint32
    mapId, uint32 instanceId, int bossStates)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new InstanceEvent object when raid information is received
    for a player.
  description: The RaidInfoReceived method is used to generate an InstanceEvent instance
    that represents the receipt of raid-related information for a specific player
    within a World of Warcraft instance. This method typically gets invoked when a
    player's raid data, such as boss encounter states or instance progress, is updated
    or synchronized with the server. It encapsulates the event data including the
    player's unique identifier (GUID), the map ID of the instance, the instance ID,
    and the current boss states. The returned InstanceEvent object can then be used
    by the game's event handling system to process updates, trigger quests, or update
    UI elements related to raid progress.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player receiving the raid information.
      This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the player's database ID.
  - name: mapId
    description: The map ID of the instance where the raid information pertains. This
      identifies which specific dungeon or raid zone the data relates to.
  - name: instanceId
    description: The unique identifier for the specific instance. This allows differentiation
      between multiple instances of the same map (e.g., different raid encounters).
  - name: bossStates
    description: An integer representing the current state of bosses in the raid.
      The value typically encodes information about which bosses have been defeated
      or are active, often using bit flags or a bitmask.
  returns: Returns an InstanceEvent object that encapsulates the event data for raid
    information received. This object can be used by the game's event system to process
    further actions based on the received raid data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: InstanceEvent event = InstanceEvent::RaidInfoReceived(12345, 1098, 67890,
      0x0F);
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Raid Info Event
    code: "InstanceEvent event = InstanceEvent::RaidInfoReceived(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ player->GetMapId(), player->GetInstanceId(), GetBossStates());\n// Process\
      \ the event\nif (event.IsValid()) {\n    // Handle raid progress update\n  \
      \  HandleRaidProgressUpdate(event);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger system that manages instance events
    and player progress in World of Warcraft instances. The bossStates parameter may
    use specific bitmasks or encoding schemes depending on the implementation, so
    developers should verify the expected format when working with this API. The returned
    InstanceEvent object should be handled carefully to avoid memory leaks or invalid
    access patterns.
  warnings: 'The method signature shows four parameters but the documentation states
    ''Parameters: None''. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the documentation
    or that the parameters are not explicitly shown in the method signature. Ensure
    that all parameters are correctly accounted for when using this method. Also,
    be cautious with bossStates encoding as incorrect values may lead to unexpected
    behavior in raid progression tracking.'
