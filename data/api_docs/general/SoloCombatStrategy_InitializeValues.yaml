documentation:
  brief: Initializes internal values and configuration for the solo combat AI strategy.
  description: The InitializeValues method sets up default parameters, configuration
    settings, and internal state variables required for the SoloCombatStrategy to
    function properly. This method is typically called during the initialization phase
    of an AI behavior tree or strategy system, ensuring that all necessary data structures
    are properly configured before the strategy begins executing combat decisions.
    It may initialize values such as attack ranges, spell cooldowns, health thresholds,
    and other tactical parameters that define how a solo player character should behave
    in combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'SoloCombatStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeValues();

      // Strategy is now ready for use in combat scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of a SoloCombatStrategy
    instance. Repeated calls may result in unexpected behavior or overwriting of existing
    configuration values. The method does not require any external dependencies to
    be set up before execution.
