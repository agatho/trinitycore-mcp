  class: ControlZoneHandler
  method: HandleContestedEventHorde
  signature: void ControlZoneHandler::HandleContestedEventHorde(GameObject * controlZone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the contested event for the Horde faction when a control zone object
    is interacted with.
  description: The HandleContestedEventHorde method is responsible for processing
    the logic associated with a contested territory event specifically for the Horde
    faction in World of Warcraft. This method is typically invoked when a player interacts
    with a control zone GameObject, such as a capture point or contested area. It
    evaluates the current state of the zone, determines if the Horde faction can claim
    or maintain control, and triggers appropriate game events or updates to the zone's
    ownership status. The method may also update player objectives, send notifications
    to players, and potentially trigger rewards or penalties based on the outcome
    of the contested event. This function is part of the broader control zone management
    system in TrinityCore that governs faction-based territorial control mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: controlZone
    description: A pointer to the GameObject representing the control zone that triggered
      this event. This object typically represents a capture point or contested area
      in the game world where factions compete for control.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within a GameObject AI handler
    code: "void GameObjectAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_uiContestedEventTimer\
      \ <= diff)\n    {\n        if (GameObject* controlZone = GetGameObjectByEntry(CONTROL_ZONE_ENTRY))\n\
      \        {\n            sControlZoneHandler->HandleContestedEventHorde(controlZone);\n\
      \        }\n        m_uiContestedEventTimer = 1000;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n\
      \        m_uiContestedEventTimer -= diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger control zone system that manages faction-based
    territorial control. It should be invoked only when a valid control zone GameObject
    is present and the game state allows for contested events to occur. The method
    may rely on internal state tracking of faction dominance, player presence, and
    other game mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the controlZone parameter is not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method should only be called in appropriate contexts where contested events
    are valid for the Horde faction.
