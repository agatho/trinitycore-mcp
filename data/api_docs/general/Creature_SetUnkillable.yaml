  class: Creature
  method: SetUnkillable
  signature: void Creature::SetUnkillable(bool unkillable)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature can be killed or not, making it unkillable.
  description: The SetUnkillable method allows developers to control whether a creature
    can be killed by players or not. When set to true, the creature becomes unkillable
    and cannot be killed by any means, including player attacks or spells. This is
    commonly used for boss creatures or NPCs that should remain alive during certain
    events or phases. The method affects the creature's behavior in combat and its
    interaction with player characters.
  parameters:
  - name: unkillable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the creature should be unkillable
      (true) or killable (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetUnkillable(true);

      // Creature is now unkillable'
    language: cpp
  - title: Boss Creature Example
    code: 'Creature* boss = GetCreature();

      boss->SetUnkillable(true);

      // Boss remains alive during event

      // Player cannot kill it'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the creature's combat behavior and can be used
    to prevent creatures from being killed during specific game events. It should
    be used carefully as it may affect gameplay balance.
  warnings: Setting a creature unkillable might cause issues if the creature is expected
    to die during normal gameplay, potentially leading to stuck or infinite loop scenarios.
