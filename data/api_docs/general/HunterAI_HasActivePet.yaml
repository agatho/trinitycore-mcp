  brief: Checks whether the hunter has an active pet in the game world
  description: The HasActivePet method determines if the hunter character currently
    controls a living, active pet. This check is essential for AI behavior logic,
    as many hunter abilities and actions are only valid when a pet is present and
    active. The method evaluates the pet's existence, status, and whether it's currently
    under the hunter's control. It does not distinguish between different types of
    pets, but rather confirms that at least one pet exists in an active state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter has an active pet present in the game world;
    returns false if no active pet is found or if the pet is inactive/dead.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (player->GetPlayerAI()->HasActivePet()) {\n    // Execute pet-related\
      \ actions\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_AIMED_SHOT, true);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Fallback behavior when no pet is active\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SHOOT, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the hunter's pet within
    the TrinityCore framework. It may return false if a pet exists but is not currently
    active (e.g., dead or dismissed), even if it has been summoned before.
