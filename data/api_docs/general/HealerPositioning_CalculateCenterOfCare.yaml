  signature: int HealerPositioning::CalculateCenterOfCare(const int & allies)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal center position for healing allies in
    a group.
  description: The CalculateCenterOfCare method determines the central location that
    best serves all allied units within a specified range, typically used by healers
    to position themselves for maximum effectiveness. This method evaluates the spatial
    distribution of nearby friendly targets and computes a coordinate that minimizes
    the average distance to all allies. The calculation considers the positioning
    logic common in World of Warcraft's AI systems where healers aim to maintain optimal
    range while covering as many units as possible. The result is an integer representation
    of the calculated center point, often used for movement or targeting decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the calculated center position for healing
    care. This value typically corresponds to a coordinate or identifier that can
    be used by the AI system to determine where to position the healer for optimal
    coverage of allies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int center = healerPositioning.CalculateCenterOfCare(allies);\n// Use center\
      \ value to move healer to optimal position\nif (center != 0) {\n    // Move\
      \ healer to calculated center\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI positioning system and may depend
    on internal state tracking of ally positions. The return value should be interpreted
    in the context of the specific coordinate system used by the TrinityCore AI framework.
