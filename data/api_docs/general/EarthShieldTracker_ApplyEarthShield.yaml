  class: EarthShieldTracker
  method: ApplyEarthShield
  signature: void EarthShieldTracker::ApplyEarthShield(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies an Earth Shield effect to a player with the specified GUID for the
    given duration.
  description: The ApplyEarthShield method is used to activate or apply the Earth
    Shield spell effect to a player character identified by their GUID. This method
    sets up the necessary tracking and application of the shield, which typically
    provides damage absorption or healing protection. The duration parameter controls
    how long the shield will remain active before expiring. This functionality is
    commonly used in Shaman class abilities within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    emulation environment. The method does not return any value but modifies internal
    state to track the shield application.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player character who will receive
      the Earth Shield effect. This should be a valid player GUID from the game world.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Earth Shield effect will
      remain active. This determines how long the shield protection lasts before expiring.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Earth Shield Application
    code: 'EarthShieldTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyEarthShield(12345, 10000); // Apply Earth Shield to player with
      GUID 12345 for 10 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Duration Application
    code: 'uint32 shieldDuration = 5000 + (player->GetLevel() * 100);

      tracker.ApplyEarthShield(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), shieldDuration); //
      Apply based on player level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal tracking systems to maintain shield
    state. It may be called from spell effect handlers or aura application logic.
    The GUID parameter should refer to a valid player object in the current game world
    context.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an active player character,
    as applying a shield to a non-existent or inactive target could cause undefined
    behavior. The duration value should be validated to prevent extremely long or
    negative durations that might break gameplay mechanics.
