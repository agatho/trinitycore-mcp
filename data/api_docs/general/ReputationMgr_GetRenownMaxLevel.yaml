  class: ReputationMgr
  method: GetRenownMaxLevel
  signature: int32 ReputationMgr::GetRenownMaxLevel(const FactionEntry * renownFactionEntry)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum renown level for a specified renown faction.
  description: The GetRenownMaxLevel method returns the highest possible renown level
    that can be achieved for a given renown faction. This value is typically used
    to determine the upper bound of reputation progression within a specific faction's
    renown system. The method takes a FactionEntry pointer representing the renown
    faction and returns an integer indicating the maximum level attainable. This functionality
    is essential for handling renown progression mechanics in World of Warcraft's
    reputation system, particularly for factions that utilize the renown tracking
    feature introduced in later expansions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the maximum renown level for the specified
    faction. Returns 0 if the faction entry is invalid or does not support renown
    progression.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nint32 maxLevel\
      \ = reputationMgr->GetRenownMaxLevel(faction);\nif (maxLevel > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use maxLevel for renown progression logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on faction data from the game's internal databases. The
    returned value is typically derived from faction-specific configuration settings
    that define the maximum renown level. Developers should ensure that the provided
    FactionEntry pointer is valid and corresponds to a faction with renown capabilities.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid FactionEntry pointer may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. Always validate the faction entry before calling this method,
    especially when dealing with dynamic faction data.
