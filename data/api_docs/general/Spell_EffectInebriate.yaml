documentation:
  brief: Inebriates the target player by consuming alcohol and increasing their drunken
    state.
  description: The EffectInebriate method handles the process of increasing a player's
    drunken state when they consume alcohol. This method is typically invoked during
    spell effects that involve alcohol consumption, such as brewing or drinking spells.
    It manages the player's drunken state by incrementing the drunkenness value and
    potentially triggering related game mechanics like reducing player stats or causing
    temporary debuffs. The method ensures proper handling of the player's intoxication
    level without causing immediate damage to the character.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::EffectInebriate()\n{\n    // Implementation for increasing\
      \ player's drunken state\n    // This method is called when a player consumes\
      \ alcohol\n    // It updates the player's drunkenness level\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be implemented with care as it directly affects player
    behavior and game balance. The implementation must ensure that the drunken state
    increment is consistent with game mechanics and does not cause unintended side
    effects.
  warnings: This method may have performance implications when used frequently, as
    it involves updating player state values. Care should be taken to avoid excessive
    calls during spell processing.
