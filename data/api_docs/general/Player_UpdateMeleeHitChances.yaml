documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's melee hit chance calculations based on current stats
    and combat state.
  description: The UpdateMeleeHitChances method recalculates and applies the player's
    melee hit probability, taking into account various factors such as attack power,
    weapon speed, target level, and player attributes. This method is typically invoked
    during combat events or when stat modifications occur to ensure accurate hit chance
    calculations for melee attacks. The updated hit chance affects the likelihood
    of successful melee hits against targets and influences overall combat effectiveness.
    It's an internal method that automatically adjusts based on player state changes
    and does not require manual invocation in most cases.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal combat system and typically called by
    the game engine during combat events. It directly affects the player's attack
    success rate in melee combat. The calculation considers base stats, weapon characteristics,
    target defense, and player level differences.
