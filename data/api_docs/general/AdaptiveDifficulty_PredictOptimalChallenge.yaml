documentation:
  brief: Predicts the optimal challenge level for a player based on their skill profile.
  description: The PredictOptimalChallenge method calculates and returns a float value
    representing the recommended difficulty level or challenge rating that would be
    most appropriate for the given player's skill profile. This method is typically
    used in adaptive difficulty systems to dynamically adjust game content, such as
    enemy levels, quest difficulties, or loot quality, based on player performance
    and progression. The calculation likely takes into account various metrics from
    the PlayerSkillProfile, including but not limited to player level, experience
    points, completion rates of previous challenges, and overall gameplay statistics.
    This ensures that players are consistently challenged without being overwhelmed
    or under-stimulated.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value indicating the predicted optimal challenge level. The exact
    range and interpretation depend on the internal scaling used by the AdaptiveDifficulty
    system, but it generally represents a normalized difficulty score between 0.0
    (easiest) and 1.0 (hardest), or a specific numerical scale relevant to the game's
    difficulty mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty adaptiveDiff;

      PlayerSkillProfile profile;

      // Assume profile is populated with player data

      float optimalChallenge = adaptiveDiff.PredictOptimalChallenge(&profile);

      // Use optimalChallenge to adjust game difficulty dynamically'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a core part of TrinityCore's adaptive difficulty system
    and may be called frequently during gameplay. It is recommended that PlayerSkillProfile
    data be up-to-date before calling this method for accurate results. The internal
    algorithm might involve machine learning or statistical models to determine the
    optimal challenge.
  warnings: Ensure that the PlayerSkillProfile passed to this method contains valid
    and current player data; otherwise, the prediction may be inaccurate. This method
    should not be called in performance-critical sections without considering its
    computational overhead.
