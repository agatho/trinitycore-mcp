documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is repeatable.
  description: The IsRepeatable method checks if a quest can be repeated by the player,
    returning true if the quest has repeatable properties and false otherwise. This
    method is essential for determining quest behavior in World of Warcraft's quest
    system, particularly when assessing whether a quest can be completed multiple
    times or if it has specific repeatable requirements such as quest flags or conditions.
    The method evaluates the quest's repeatable status based on internal quest data
    and player-specific conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is repeatable, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the quest can be completed multiple times or has repeatable characteristics
    that allow for reattempts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (quest->IsRepeatable()) {\n    // Quest can be repeated\n    // Do something\
      \ with repeatable quest logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Quest cannot be repeated\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Quest* quest = player->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nif (quest && quest->IsRepeatable())\
      \ {\n    // Handle repeatable quest logic\n    // This could be used in quest\
      \ completion checks\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest data structures and may not reflect
    all possible repeatable conditions. Performance considerations are minimal as
    this is a simple boolean check. Thread safety is ensured since the method is const
    and does not modify any state.
  warnings: Be aware that some quests may appear repeatable but have specific conditions
    or requirements that prevent actual repetition. The method does not account for
    quest-specific restrictions like level requirements or prerequisite quests.
