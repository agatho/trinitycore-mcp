  class: PointMovementGenerator
  method: Reset
  signature: void PointMovementGenerator::Reset(int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the movement generator's internal state and clears any active movement
    commands for the associated owner.
  description: The Reset method is used to clear the current movement state of a PointMovementGenerator
    instance. It ensures that any ongoing or pending movement commands are cancelled,
    and resets the generator to its initial idle state. This method is typically invoked
    when a creature or unit needs to interrupt its current movement path, such as
    during combat engagement, target switching, or when a new movement command is
    issued. The method accepts an integer pointer to the owner entity, which allows
    it to properly manage the movement context and ensure that all related resources
    are correctly reset.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the entity (creature
      or unit) associated with this movement generator. This is used to validate ownership
      and reset the correct movement state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'PointMovementGenerator movementGen;

      int ownerGuid = 12345;

      movementGen.Reset(&ownerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset During Combat Transition
    code: "void OnCombatEnter(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (me->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == POINT_MOTION_TYPE)\n    {\n        PointMovementGenerator* gen = static_cast<PointMovementGenerator*>(me->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n\
      \        gen->Reset(&me->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully to avoid unintended movement interruptions.
    It is recommended that the owner parameter points to a valid entity identifier
    to ensure proper cleanup of movement-related resources.
  warnings: Calling Reset without a valid owner pointer may lead to undefined behavior
    or resource leaks. Ensure that the provided integer pointer references an active
    and valid entity before invoking this method.
