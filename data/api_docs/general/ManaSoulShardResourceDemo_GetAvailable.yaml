  class: ManaSoulShardResourceDemo
  method: GetAvailable
  signature: uint32 ManaSoulShardResourceDemo::GetAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current number of available mana soul shards for the player.
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the count of mana soul shards that
    are currently available to the player. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    mana soul shards are a resource used by certain classes, particularly warlocks,
    to fuel their abilities and spells. This method provides access to the current
    value of this resource without modifying it. The returned value represents how
    many shards can be consumed in the next ability usage or spell cast that requires
    them.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of mana soul shards currently available
    to the player. This value is typically between 0 and 5, as players usually have
    a maximum of 5 mana soul shards at any given time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 shards = player->GetManaSoulShardResourceDemo()->GetAvailable();\n\
      if (shards > 0)\n{\n    // Player has available mana soul shards\n    // Proceed\
      \ with shard-consuming ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Availability Before Casting
    code: "ManaSoulShardResourceDemo* resource = player->GetManaSoulShardResourceDemo();\n\
      uint32 available = resource->GetAvailable();\nif (available >= 2)\n{\n    //\
      \ Cast a spell that costs 2 mana soul shards\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_CONSUME_SHARDS, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Not enough shards, handle\
      \ accordingly\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough mana soul shards.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is read-only and does not modify the internal state of the mana
    soul shard resource. It's commonly used in conjunction with methods that consume
    or modify the shard count, such as ConsumeShards() or SetAvailable(). The value
    returned may change dynamically based on game events like spell casting, item
    usage, or class-specific abilities.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns only the current available count and
    does not account for pending consumptions. If a player is about to cast a spell
    that will consume shards, ensure you check GetAvailable() immediately before the
    cast to avoid over-consumption errors.
