    & cond) const
documentation:
  brief: Adds a condition to the spell implicit target conditions collection.
  description: The addToSpellImplicitTargetConditions method is responsible for adding
    a given Condition object to the internal collection of conditions that are associated
    with spell implicit target rules. This functionality is crucial in TrinityCore's
    condition system, where various game mechanics rely on evaluating conditions before
    applying effects or targeting spells. The method ensures that the provided condition
    is properly registered within the global condition manager, allowing it to be
    evaluated during spell target validation processes. This method is typically invoked
    during server initialization or when loading spell data from database entries.
  parameters:
  - name: cond
    description: A const reference to a Condition object that represents the condition
      to be added to the spell implicit target conditions collection. The condition
      must be properly initialized with valid type, source types, and other required
      parameters before being passed to this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Spell Target Condition
    code: 'Condition cond;

      cond.mSourceType = CONDITION_SPELL_TARGET;

      cond.mSourceGroup = 0;

      cond.mSourceEntry = 12345;

      cond.mElseGroup = 0;

      cond.mConditionType = CONDITION_AURA;

      cond.mConditionValue1 = 100;

      cond.mConditionValue2 = 0;

      cond.mConditionValue3 = 0;

      conditionMgr->addToSpellImplicitTargetConditions(cond);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global static collection within the ConditionMgr class.
    It should only be called during server startup or initialization phases to avoid
    potential race conditions in multi-threaded environments. The condition added
    must have valid source and target information to ensure proper evaluation during
    spell targeting.
  warnings: Calling this method with an improperly initialized Condition object may
    lead to undefined behavior or runtime errors during condition evaluation. Ensure
    that all required fields of the Condition struct are properly set before calling
    this method.
