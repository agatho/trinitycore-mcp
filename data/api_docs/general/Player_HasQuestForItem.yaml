  brief: Checks whether the player has a quest associated with the specified item.
  description: This method determines if a player has an active quest that requires
    the given item for completion. It is commonly used in quest system logic to verify
    item requirements or to check if a player can turn in items for quest credit.
    The method returns true if the player has a quest associated with the specified
    item, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for handling quest completion
    mechanics and ensuring proper game progression.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->HasQuestForItem(12345)) {\n    // Player has a quest for item\
      \ 12345\n    // Proceed with quest completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to validate item requirements. Performance-wise, it may involve database queries
    or cached checks depending on how the system handles quest tracking.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks for quests associated with the item,
    not necessarily whether the player has the item in their inventory. The method
    does not verify if the player has enough quantity of the item required by the
    quest.
