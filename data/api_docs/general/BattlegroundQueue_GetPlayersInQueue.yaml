  class: BattlegroundQueue
  method: GetPlayersInQueue
  signature: uint32 BattlegroundQueue::GetPlayersInQueue(int id)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of players currently queued for a specific battleground
    type.
  description: The GetPlayersInQueue method returns the count of players who are currently
    waiting in the queue for a particular battleground type identified by the provided
    ID. This method is used internally by the battleground system to manage player
    queues and determine when a battleground can be started based on minimum player
    requirements. The method operates on the battleground queue system which tracks
    players across different battleground types, ensuring proper matchmaking and queue
    management. It does not modify any state but simply retrieves current queue statistics
    for reporting or decision-making purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The identifier of the battleground type to query. This corresponds
      to the battleground template ID used internally by TrinityCore's battleground
      system.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of players currently queued
    for the specified battleground type. A return value of 0 indicates no players
    are waiting in queue for that specific battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Check queue size for Alterac Valley
    code: "uint32 playersInQueue = bgQueue.GetPlayersInQueue(BATTLEGROUND_AV);\nif\
      \ (playersInQueue > 0)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Alterac Valley has %u players\
      \ queued.\", playersInQueue);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine if battleground can start
    code: "uint32 playerCount = bgQueue.GetPlayersInQueue(BATTLEGROUND_WS);\nif (playerCount\
      \ >= 10)\n{\n    // Start battleground\n    sBattlegroundMgr->CreateBattleground(BATTLEGROUND_WS);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    queue management system maintains separate counts for each battleground type,
    allowing accurate tracking of players per battleground. The returned value reflects
    the current state at the time of the call and may change immediately after the
    method returns.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned player count includes all players in the queue
    regardless of their group status or whether they are eligible to join. This count
    does not account for players who might be removed from the queue due to timeout
    or other conditions.
