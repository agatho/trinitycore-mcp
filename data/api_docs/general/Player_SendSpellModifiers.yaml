  brief: Send spell modifiers to the player's client
  description: This method sends spell modifier information to the player's client,
    allowing the player to receive updates on spell modifications such as critical
    chance, damage bonuses, or other stat changes. It is typically used during spell
    activation or when modifying spell properties in response to game mechanics. The
    method ensures that the player's client receives accurate information about spell
    modifications without requiring manual updates of the client-side data.

  notes: This method is part of the player's internal communication system and should
    be called when spell modifications need to be updated. It may involve sending
    data packets to the client, and performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary
    calls during combat or when spell modifiers are not actively changing.
