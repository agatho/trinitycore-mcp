  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: BeginTick
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::BeginTick(uint32 currentTime)
documentation:
  brief: Records the start time of a performance monitoring tick for bot behavior
    analysis.
  description: The BeginTick method initializes a performance measurement cycle by
    recording the current timestamp. This method is typically called at the beginning
    of each game tick or update cycle to track how long various bot operations take.
    It allows the BotPerformanceMonitor to calculate execution times and detect potential
    performance bottlenecks in AI behavior. The method does not perform any direct
    actions but sets up timing data necessary for subsequent monitoring operations.
  parameters:
  - name: currentTime
    description: The current system time in milliseconds since epoch, used as a reference
      point for measuring performance duration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateBots(uint32 diff)\n{\n    botPerformanceMonitor.BeginTick(getMSTime());\n\
      \    // Bot AI update logic here\n    botPerformanceMonitor.EndTick();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Integration
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    static uint32 lastTick = 0;\n    uint32 now\
      \ = getMSTime();\n    \n    if (now - lastTick >= BOT_TICK_INTERVAL)\n    {\n\
      \        botPerformanceMonitor.BeginTick(now);\n        // Execute bot AI logic\n\
      \        botPerformanceMonitor.EndTick();\n        lastTick = now;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called at the beginning of each monitored tick cycle.
    It's designed to work in conjunction with EndTick() to provide complete timing
    measurements. The performance monitor uses this timestamp to compute execution
    durations for profiling bot behavior.
  warnings: Ensure BeginTick is always paired with EndTick to maintain accurate timing
    data. Failure to call EndTick after BeginTick will result in incomplete or incorrect
    performance metrics.
