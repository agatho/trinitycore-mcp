documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PlayerbotGroupManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerbotGroupManager class is responsible for
    cleaning up all internal data structures, releasing memory allocated for player
    bot groups, and ensuring proper shutdown of any active bot group operations. This
    method is automatically invoked when a PlayerbotGroupManager object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no dangling pointers or memory
    leaks occur during the destruction of the manager instance. In the context of
    TrinityCore's player bot system, this destructor plays a critical role in maintaining
    stable server performance by properly disposing of bot group-related resources.

  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerbotGroupManager
    code: "void Cleanup() {\n    PlayerbotGroupManager* manager = new PlayerbotGroupManager();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete manager; // Destructor is automatically\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for preventing
    memory leaks in the player bot system. It should not be called manually unless
    explicitly deleting an object, as it's automatically invoked during object destruction.
    The implementation likely handles removal of all active bot groups and ensures
    proper synchronization if multiple threads are involved.
