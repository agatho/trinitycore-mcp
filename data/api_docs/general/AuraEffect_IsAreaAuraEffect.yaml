  signature: bool AuraEffect::IsAreaAuraEffect() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the aura effect is an area aura effect.
  description: The IsAreaAuraEffect method checks if the current AuraEffect instance
    represents an area aura effect. Area auras are special types of auras that affect
    multiple targets within a specified radius, such as healing aoes or damage zones.
    This method returns true if the aura effect is classified as an area aura, and
    false otherwise. The determination is based on the aura's type and flags set during
    its creation. This functionality is crucial for game mechanics involving area-of-effect
    spells and abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura effect is an area aura effect; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Aura Effect is Area Aura
    code: "if (auraEffect->IsAreaAuraEffect()) {\n    // Handle area aura specific\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"This is an area aura effect\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ regular aura logic\n    printf(\"This is not an area aura effect\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal aura type flags and should only be called
    on valid AuraEffect instances. The implementation may vary depending on how the
    aura was originally created and configured in the spell system.
