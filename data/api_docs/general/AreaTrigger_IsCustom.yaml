  class: AreaTrigger
  method: IsCustom
  signature: bool AreaTrigger::IsCustom() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the area trigger is a custom-defined trigger rather than
    a default game trigger.
  description: The IsCustom method checks if the current AreaTrigger instance was
    defined through custom scripts or database entries rather than being a built-in
    game mechanic. This flag is typically set during the creation of area triggers
    that are not part of the standard World of Warcraft trigger system, such as those
    created by custom spells, quests, or scripted events. The method returns true
    if the trigger has been marked as custom and false otherwise. This functionality
    allows the core game engine to differentiate between standard and custom-defined
    area triggers for proper handling during event processing and cleanup.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger is a custom-defined trigger, false if
    it is a default game trigger.
  examples:
  - title: Check if AreaTrigger is Custom
    code: "if (areaTrigger->IsCustom()) {\n    // Handle custom area trigger logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Custom area trigger detected\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ standard area trigger logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Standard area trigger detected\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on an internal flag that is set during the AreaTrigger's
    initialization process. The flag is typically managed by the TrinityCore server
    when loading triggers from the database or creating them through scripting interfaces.
