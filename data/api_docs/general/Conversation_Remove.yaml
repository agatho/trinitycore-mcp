documentation:
  brief: Removes the conversation from the active state, typically clearing it from
    the player's interface and marking it for potential cleanup.
  description: The Conversation::Remove method is used to remove a conversation from
    the active state within the game world. This action typically results in the conversation
    being cleared from the player's user interface, and may also mark the conversation
    object for garbage collection or reuse. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations. It is generally called when a conversation
    has been completed, interrupted, or needs to be explicitly removed from active
    memory. This method is part of the core conversation management system in TrinityCore,
    which handles dialogue sequences, quest interactions, and NPC conversations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Conversation Removal
    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectMgr->GetConversation(12345);\nif (conv)\n{\n\
      \    conv->Remove();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on conversations that are currently active
    and managed by the game engine. Calling Remove() on a conversation that has already
    been removed or is not properly initialized may lead to undefined behavior. The
    actual removal process might involve multiple internal steps including UI updates,
    memory cleanup, and state transitions.
  warnings: Calling Remove() on a conversation that is already in the process of being
    destroyed can cause double-free errors or access violations. Always ensure proper
    reference counting and lifecycle management when working with conversation objects.
