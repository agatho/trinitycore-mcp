  class: EntityFragmentsHolder
  method: Remove
  signature: void EntityFragmentsHolder::Remove(EntityFragment fragment)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified entity fragment from the holder.
  description: The Remove method is used to delete or unregister a specific EntityFragment
    from the EntityFragmentsHolder. This operation typically invalidates the fragment
    reference and may trigger cleanup processes within the holder's internal data
    structures. The method ensures that the removed fragment is no longer accessible
    through the holder and updates any associated tracking mechanisms. It is commonly
    used in scenarios where entity components need to be dynamically modified or destroyed
    during gameplay, such as when an object is despawned or its properties are changed.
  parameters:
  - name: fragment
    description: The EntityFragment instance to be removed from the holder. This parameter
      must represent a valid fragment that was previously added to the holder; otherwise,
      behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fragment Removal
    code: 'EntityFragmentsHolder holder;

      EntityFragment frag = holder.Add(...);

      holder.Remove(frag); // Removes the fragment from the holder'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Multiple Fragments
    code: "EntityFragmentsHolder holder;\nstd::vector<EntityFragment> fragments =\
      \ {frag1, frag2, frag3};\nfor (const auto& f : fragments) {\n    holder.Remove(f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the fragment has been properly initialized and added
    to the holder before calling Remove. Failure to do so may lead to undefined behavior
    or memory corruption. The implementation likely involves internal bookkeeping
    such as reference counting or hash table lookups for efficient removal.
  warnings: Calling Remove with an invalid or unregistered fragment can cause crashes
    or data inconsistency issues. Always ensure that the fragment was previously added
    to the holder before attempting removal.
