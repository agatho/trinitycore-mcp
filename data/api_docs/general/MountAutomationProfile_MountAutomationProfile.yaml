  brief: Initializes a new MountAutomationProfile instance with default settings.
  description: The MountAutomationProfile constructor initializes a new instance of
    the MountAutomationProfile class. This method sets up the internal state of the
    profile with default values, preparing it for use in mount automation logic within
    the TrinityCore framework. The constructor ensures that all necessary data members
    are properly initialized before the profile can be used to manage player mount
    behaviors or automation rules.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MountAutomationProfile instance
    code: 'MountAutomationProfile profile;

      // The profile is now initialized with default settings and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called when creating a new mount automation
    profile object. It's important to note that this method does not perform any validation
    or loading of existing profile data; it simply initializes the object with default
    values.
