  brief: Moves the contents of another SpellHistory object to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator for SpellHistory transfers all managed
    resources from the source SpellHistory object to this object. This operation is
    typically used when reassigning a SpellHistory instance with an rvalue reference,
    allowing efficient resource transfer without deep copying. The source object is
    left in a valid but unspecified state after the move operation. In the context
    of TrinityCore's spell system, this method supports efficient management of spell
    cooldowns and history tracking during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current SpellHistory object (this) after the move assignment
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'SpellHistory history1;

      SpellHistory history2 = std::move(history1); // Uses move assignment

      // history1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Spell Cooldown Management
    code: "void UpdateSpellCooldown(SpellInfo* spellInfo) {\n    SpellHistory newHistory;\n\
      \    // ... populate newHistory with cooldown data ...\n    \n    // Move the\
      \ new history to existing history\n    this->spellHistory = std::move(newHistory);\n\
      \    // newHistory is now empty, but valid\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation which is more efficient than copy
    assignment. The source SpellHistory object should not be used after the move operation
    as its state becomes undefined. This implementation follows standard C++ move
    semantics for resource management.
  warnings: After calling this move assignment operator, the source object should
    not be accessed or used in any way, as it will be left in a valid but unspecified
    state. Improper usage can lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks.
