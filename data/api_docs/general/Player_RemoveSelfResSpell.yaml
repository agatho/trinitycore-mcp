documentation:
  brief: Removes a self-resurrection spell from the player's spell list.
  description: This method removes a specific self-resurrection spell from the player's
    spell list, effectively preventing the player from being able to resurrect themselves
    using that particular spell. The method is typically used in scenarios where a
    player's self-resurrection ability needs to be disabled or removed, such as during
    certain quest events or when implementing game mechanics that prevent self-resurrection.
    It operates on the principle of removing a specific spell ID from the player's
    known spells, which can affect their ability to resurrect themselves in case of
    death.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID of the self-resurrection spell to be removed from the
      player's spell list. This parameter specifies which spell should be removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveSelfResSpell(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nint32 spellId = 12345;\nif (player->HasSpell(spellId))\n\
      {\n    player->RemoveSelfResSpell(spellId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error\
      \ case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies the player's spell list internally, and may involve
    checking if the spell exists before attempting removal. The implementation may
    involve removing a specific spell ID from the player's known spells list, which
    could affect their ability to resurrect themselves in case of death.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect the player's ability
    to resurrect themselves. If used incorrectly, it might prevent players from using
    self-resurrection abilities at critical moments during gameplay.
