  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::OnCombatStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat behavior when an AI entity enters combat mode
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a CombatAIIntegrator instance
    begins combat, typically triggered by an enemy detection or attack event. This
    method sets up the initial state for combat-related AI behaviors, including target
    selection, stance adjustment, and activation of combat-specific abilities. It
    serves as the entry point for initiating all combat-related logic within the AI
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the combat target's identifier.
      This parameter is used to establish the initial combat target for the AI entity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Start Initialization
    code: "void MyCombatAI::OnCombatStart(int* target)\n{\n    // Set the target for\
      \ combat\n    m_target = *target;\n    \n    // Initialize combat stance\n \
      \   SetStance(STANCE_COMBAT);\n    \n    // Begin combat abilities\n    StartCombatAbilities();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore AI framework
    when an NPC enters combat state. Developers should ensure proper initialization
    of target tracking and combat state variables within this method.
  warnings: The target parameter may be null or invalid if the AI does not have a
    valid combat target at the time of invocation. Always validate the target pointer
    before dereferencing it.
