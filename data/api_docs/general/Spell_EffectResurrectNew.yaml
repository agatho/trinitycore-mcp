  brief: Resurrects the target player using the new resurrection system
  description: The EffectResurrectNew method handles the resurrection of a player
    character using the modern resurrection mechanics in TrinityCore. This method
    is typically invoked during spell effects that trigger resurrection, such as the
    'Resurrection' spell or similar. It ensures the player's health and mana are restored,
    and the player is returned to life with appropriate benefits. The method operates
    within the context of the spell's effect handling system and requires proper target
    validation before execution.

      }"

  notes: This method is part of the spell effect system and must be called within
    proper spell execution contexts. It requires valid target player objects to function
    correctly.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to game crashes or incorrect resurrection
    behavior. Ensure that the target is actually dead before calling this method.
