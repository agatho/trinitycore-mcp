  method: GetRecentInstanceOwner
  signature: int Group::GetRecentInstanceOwner(int mapId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the most recent instance owner ID for a specified map within the
    group.
  description: The GetRecentInstanceOwner method returns the GUID of the player who
    last owned an instance on the specified map. This is used primarily in group-based
    instance management to track which player has control over a particular instance.
    The method does not validate whether the player is still online or in the group,
    and it only considers the most recent owner recorded for the given map ID. It's
    commonly used in conjunction with instance reset mechanics and group loot distribution
    systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the most recent instance owner
    for the specified map. If no owner has been recorded for the map, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Instance Owner for a Specific Map
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int instanceOwnerGUID\
      \ = group->GetRecentInstanceOwner(1234); // For map ID 1234\n    if (instanceOwnerGUID\
      \ != 0)\n    {\n        // Process the instance owner GUID\n        Player*\
      \ owner = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(instanceOwnerGUID));\n\
      \        if (owner)\n        {\n            // Owner found in the world\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of instance ownership within the
    group. The implementation may not persist across server restarts or reloads unless
    explicitly saved to database. It's intended for internal TrinityCore systems and
    should be used carefully in custom modules.
  warnings: The returned GUID does not guarantee that the player is currently online
    or even in the same map. This method should not be used as a direct replacement
    for checking group membership or current instance status.
