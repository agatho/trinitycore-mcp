  class: Player
  method: SatisfyQuestMonth
  signature: bool Player::SatisfyQuestMonth(const Quest * qInfo, bool msg) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player satisfies the monthly quest requirements for a given
    quest.
  description: The SatisfyQuestMonth method determines whether a player has met all
    the necessary conditions to be eligible for a monthly quest. This includes checking
    if the player has not already completed the quest this month, verifying that the
    quest is a valid monthly quest, and ensuring that any prerequisite quests or requirements
    are satisfied. The method returns true if the player can proceed with the quest,
    false otherwise. If the 'msg' parameter is set to true, appropriate system messages
    may be sent to the player regarding quest eligibility.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that represents the quest being checked
      for monthly requirements.
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether system messages should be displayed
      to the player if eligibility conditions are not met.
  returns: Returns true if the player satisfies all monthly quest requirements and
    can proceed with the quest; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check Monthly Quest Eligibility
    code: "if (player->SatisfyQuestMonth(quest, true)) {\n    // Player can accept\
      \ or complete the quest\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ cannot proceed with the quest\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have already\
      \ completed this monthly quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    processing quest acceptance or completion logic. It's important to note that the
    method may modify internal quest tracking state for the player, particularly regarding
    monthly quest completion counts.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the underlying
    quest system mechanics. Incorrect usage can lead to inconsistent quest state tracking
    and unexpected behavior in the player's quest log.
