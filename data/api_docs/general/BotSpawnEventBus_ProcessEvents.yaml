  method: ProcessEvents
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::ProcessEvents()
documentation:
  brief: Processes all pending bot spawn events in the event bus.
  description: The ProcessEvents method iterates through all queued bot spawn events
    and executes their associated handlers. This method is typically called during
    the game loop to ensure that bot spawning operations are handled in a timely manner.
    It manages the lifecycle of bot creation requests, including validating spawn
    conditions, allocating resources, and invoking appropriate callbacks. The method
    ensures that events are processed in the order they were added to the queue, maintaining
    consistency in bot deployment across the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Process all pending bot spawn events\n\
      \    sBotSpawnEventBus->ProcessEvents();\n    \n    // Continue with other game\
      \ updates\n    UpdateWorldStates();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the main game loop to prevent event
    queue buildup. The processing is synchronous and may block execution until all
    events are handled, so it's recommended to keep event handlers lightweight. Events
    are processed in FIFO order.
  warnings: Calling this method from multiple threads simultaneously can cause race
    conditions and unpredictable behavior. Ensure that event queuing and processing
    happen on the same thread or use proper synchronization mechanisms.
