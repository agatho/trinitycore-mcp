  class: IBotSessionManager
  method: CleanupInactiveSessions
  signature: uint32 IBotSessionManager::CleanupInactiveSessions()
documentation:
  brief: Removes and cleans up all inactive bot sessions from the session manager.
  description: The CleanupInactiveSessions method iterates through all registered
    bot sessions managed by the IBotSessionManager and removes those that are no longer
    active. This process typically involves identifying sessions that have timed out,
    been disconnected, or otherwise become inactive according to configured thresholds.
    The method ensures that system resources are freed up by destroying stale session
    data and updating internal tracking structures. It is commonly invoked periodically
    by the server's maintenance routines or triggered manually during system cleanup
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of inactive sessions that
    were successfully removed and cleaned up from the manager.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 cleanedCount = botSessionManager->CleanupInactiveSessions();

      LOG_INFO("misc", "Cleaned up {} inactive bot sessions", cleanedCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications if a large number of sessions
    exist, as it performs iteration and cleanup operations on each inactive session.
    It is recommended to call this method during low-traffic periods or as part of
    scheduled maintenance tasks.
