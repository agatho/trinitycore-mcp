documentation:
  brief: Updates the orbital position of an area trigger based on its current orbit
    parameters.
  description: The UpdateOrbitPosition method calculates and applies the new positional
    coordinates for an AreaTrigger that is following an orbital path. This method
    is typically invoked during each update cycle to maintain the smooth motion of
    area triggers that are rotating around a central point or target. It handles the
    mathematical computation of angular displacement, radius changes, and updates
    the trigger's world position accordingly. The method ensures that the area trigger
    remains in sync with its defined orbit parameters such as speed, radius, and center
    point.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    _areaTrigger->UpdateOrbitPosition();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core update system. Developers
    should not typically call it directly unless implementing custom orbital behavior.
    The method assumes that orbit parameters have already been initialized and are
    valid.
