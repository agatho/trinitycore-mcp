  signature: void EconomyManager::SetAutoPostAuctions(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the automatic posting of auctions by the EconomyManager.
  description: The SetAutoPostAuctions method controls whether the EconomyManager
    automatically posts auctions for items in the player's inventory. When enabled,
    the system will periodically check for eligible items and post them on the auction
    house according to configured rules. When disabled, no automatic auction posting
    occurs. This functionality is typically used by automated systems or bots to manage
    auction house activity without manual intervention.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag that determines whether automatic auction posting is
      enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Automatic Auction Posting
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = player->GetEconomyManager();

      economyMgr->SetAutoPostAuctions(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Automatic Auction Posting
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = player->GetEconomyManager();

      economyMgr->SetAutoPostAuctions(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately post auctions; it only sets the internal
    flag that controls whether future auction posting operations are performed. The
    actual auction posting behavior depends on other system settings and timers.
