  method: GetEstimatedResponseTimeMs
  signature: uint32 LLMProvider::GetEstimatedResponseTimeMs() const
documentation:
  brief: Estimates and returns the expected response time in milliseconds for the
    LLM provider.
  description: The GetEstimatedResponseTimeMs method provides an estimate of how long
    it will take for the LLM provider to generate a response. This value is typically
    calculated based on factors such as network latency, server load, and the complexity
    of the request. The returned value is expressed in milliseconds and can be used
    by calling code to manage user expectations or implement timeout mechanisms. This
    method does not perform any actual computation or communication with the LLM;
    it simply returns a pre-calculated or cached estimate.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the estimated response time in milliseconds.
    The value is typically non-zero and reflects the expected delay before a response
    becomes available from the LLM provider.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LLMProvider* provider = GetLLMProvider();

      uint32 estimatedTime = provider->GetEstimatedResponseTimeMs();

      printf("Estimated response time: %u ms\n", estimatedTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Timeout Logic
    code: 'LLMProvider* provider = GetLLMProvider();

      uint32 estimatedTime = provider->GetEstimatedResponseTimeMs();

      // Set a timeout slightly longer than the estimated time

      uint32 timeout = estimatedTime * 1.5f;

      // Use timeout in async request handling'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or computed periodically to avoid expensive
    recalculations on every call. The estimation may vary based on current system
    conditions, but the value returned is consistent for a given instance during its
    lifetime unless updated by internal logic.
  warnings: The returned value is an estimate and not a guaranteed response time.
    Actual response times may differ due to network variability, server load, or processing
    delays. Do not rely solely on this value for critical timing-sensitive operations
    without additional fallbacks.
