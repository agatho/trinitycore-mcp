documentation:
  brief: Retrieves spawn group data for a specified spawn type and ID
  description: The GetSpawnGroupData method retrieves the spawn group data associated
    with a given spawn type and spawn ID. This method is used in TrinityCore's object
    management system to fetch configuration data related to how game objects or creatures
    should be spawned within specific groups. The returned data typically includes
    information such as spawn timing, conditions, or grouping rules that determine
    when and how entities appear in the world. The method operates on internal spawn
    group tables and returns a pointer to an array of integers representing the data
    structure for the requested spawn group.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type identifier of the spawn group, which categorizes the kind
      of entities or objects being managed (e.g., creature, gameobject)
  - name: spawnId
    description: The unique identifier for a specific spawn within the given type,
      used to distinguish between different spawn configurations
  returns: A pointer to an array of integers containing the spawn group data. Returns
    NULL if no spawn group data is found for the specified type and ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spawn Group Data for a Creature
    code: "const int* data = sObjectMgr->GetSpawnGroupData(SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE, 12345);\n\
      if (data != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the spawn group data\n    printf(\"\
      Spawn group data retrieved: %d, %d, %d\\n\", data[0], data[1], data[2]);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for Valid Spawn Group Data
    code: "const int* spawnData = sObjectMgr->GetSpawnGroupData(SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT,\
      \ 67890);\nif (spawnData == nullptr)\n{\n    // Handle case where no data exists\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"No spawn group data found for gameobject ID 67890\");\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Use the data to determine spawn behavior\n    int conditionId\
      \ = spawnData[0];\n    int respawnTime = spawnData[1];\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that are typically populated
    during server startup or database loading. The returned integer array should be
    treated as read-only and must not be modified directly. Performance is optimized
    through internal caching mechanisms, but repeated calls with the same parameters
    may still incur overhead.
  warnings: The returned pointer is only valid for the lifetime of the ObjectMgr instance
    and should not be stored or used after the object manager has been destroyed.
    Accessing memory beyond the bounds of the returned array can lead to undefined
    behavior.
