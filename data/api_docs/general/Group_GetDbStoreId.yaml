  class: Group
  method: GetDbStoreId
  signature: int Group::GetDbStoreId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the database store identifier associated with this group.
  description: The GetDbStoreId method retrieves the unique database identifier that
    is used to reference this group in the TrinityCore database. This ID is typically
    assigned when the group is created and stored in the 'groups' table of the database.
    The returned value serves as a persistent identifier for the group across server
    sessions and is essential for maintaining group state, member tracking, and synchronization
    with the database. This method does not perform any database queries; it simply
    returns the cached or previously assigned ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique database store identifier (ID) of this
    group. A value of 0 typically indicates that the group has not yet been saved
    to the database or is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log group database ID
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int dbId = group->GetDbStoreId();\n\
      \    TC_LOG_INFO(\"group\", \"Group DB ID: %d\", dbId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with group management operations,
    such as saving or loading groups from the database. The returned ID is typically
    set during group creation and remains constant throughout the group's lifetime
    unless explicitly reset.
