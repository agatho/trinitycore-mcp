  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: GetStats
  signature: const EventStats & BotSpawnEventBus::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the statistical data of bot spawn events.
  description: The GetStats method returns a constant reference to an EventStats object
    that contains detailed statistics about bot spawn events handled by the BotSpawnEventBus.
    This includes information such as total spawns, successful spawns, failed spawns,
    and other relevant metrics. The returned statistics are updated in real-time as
    events occur, providing up-to-date insights into the performance and behavior
    of the bot spawning system within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an EventStats object containing cumulative statistics
    for all bot spawn events processed by this event bus instance. The stats include
    counts of various event outcomes and timing information.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Bot Spawn Statistics
    code: 'const EventStats& stats = botSpawnEventBus.GetStats();

      uint32 totalSpawns = stats.totalEvents;

      uint32 successfulSpawns = stats.successfulEvents;

      uint32 failedSpawns = stats.failedEvents;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Bot Spawn Performance
    code: "void LogBotSpawnStats(BotSpawnEventBus& eventBus) {\n    const EventStats&\
      \ stats = eventBus.GetStats();\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot Spawning Stats - Total:\
      \ %u, Success: %u, Failed: %u\",\n                    stats.totalEvents, stats.successfulEvents,\
      \ stats.failedEvents);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned EventStats reference is valid only as long as the BotSpawnEventBus
    instance exists. The statistics are thread-safe and can be accessed concurrently
    from multiple threads without explicit locking. This method does not modify any
    internal state of the event bus.
  warnings: Do not store the returned reference beyond the lifetime of the BotSpawnEventBus
    instance, as it may lead to dangling references. The EventStats object should
    not be modified directly through this reference as it is meant to be read-only.
