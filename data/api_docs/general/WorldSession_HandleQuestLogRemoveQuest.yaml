documentation:
  brief: Removes a quest from the player's quest log upon receiving a client packet
    request.
  description: The HandleQuestLogRemoveQuest method processes incoming packets from
    the client to remove a specific quest from the player's active quest log. This
    function is typically invoked when a player clicks the 'Abandon Quest' button
    in the quest log interface. The method validates that the quest exists in the
    player's log and removes it from both the player's active quests and the database,
    ensuring consistency between client and server state. It also handles sending
    appropriate responses back to the client to update the UI accordingly.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQuestLogRemoveQuest(WorldPackets::Quest::QuestLogRemoveQuest&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        uint32 questId\
      \ = packet.QuestID;\n        player->RemoveQuest(questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the client has already validated the quest ID and
    that the player has permission to abandon the quest. The actual removal of the
    quest from the database is handled by the Player::RemoveQuest method, which ensures
    proper cleanup of quest-related data such as objective progress and rewards.
