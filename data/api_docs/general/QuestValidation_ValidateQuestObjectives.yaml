api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateQuestObjectives
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateQuestObjectives(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets all objectives for a specified quest.
  description: The ValidateQuestObjectives method checks if the provided player character
    has completed all required objectives associated with the given quest ID. This
    includes verifying kill counts, item collection, and other quest-specific conditions.
    The method is typically used in automated quest validation systems or AI-driven
    quest completion logic within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. It
    ensures that quest progress is accurately tracked and prevents invalid quest rewards
    from being granted.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate. Must correspond to
      a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      progress is being validated. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if all quest objectives are completed and met by the player,
    false otherwise. If the quest does not exist or the player has no progress recorded
    for it, the method returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateQuestObjectives(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player has completed all objectives\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Player still needs to complete objectives\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Quest objectives not yet completed.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Quest Validation
    code: "class QuestBot {\npublic:\n    bool ValidateAndCompleteQuest(uint32 questId,\
      \ Player* bot) {\n        if (QuestValidation::ValidateQuestObjectives(questId,\
      \ bot)) {\n            bot->CompleteQuest(questId);\n            return true;\n\
      \        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current quest state stored in the database.
    It does not perform real-time checks against game events but validates against
    existing progress records. The method may be called frequently during bot operations
    or automated quest systems, so performance should be considered for high-volume
    usage.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter corresponds to an actual quest in the
    database; otherwise, behavior is undefined. Also, always verify that the player
    pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent null pointer dereferences.
