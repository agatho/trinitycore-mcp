  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: ApplyCharacterDistribution
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ApplyCharacterDistribution()
documentation:
  brief: Applies the character distribution configuration to all player bots in the
    migration manager.
  description: The ApplyCharacterDistribution method is responsible for executing
    the configured character distribution logic across all managed player bots within
    the PlayerbotMigrationMgr. This method typically handles the assignment or redistribution
    of character attributes, skills, or other game-related properties according to
    predefined rules or configurations stored in the migration manager. It ensures
    that each bot's characteristics are properly aligned with the specified distribution
    strategy. The method may perform validation checks on the configuration before
    applying changes and returns a boolean result indicating success or failure of
    the operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the character distribution was successfully applied to
    all player bots, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate configuration
    errors, invalid bot states, or failures during the application process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr* migrationMgr = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance();\n\
      bool success = migrationMgr->ApplyCharacterDistribution();\nif (success)\n{\n\
      \    // Distribution applied successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Character distribution\
      \ applied successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle failure case\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to apply character distribution.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the migration manager has been properly
    initialized with a valid configuration. It is typically invoked during server
    startup or when applying new distribution rules. The method may block execution
    until all bots have been processed, depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are actively engaged in gameplay or combat
    may result in unexpected behavior or data corruption. Always ensure that player
    bots are in a safe state before invoking this method. Additionally, repeated calls
    without proper configuration updates may lead to inconsistent bot states.
