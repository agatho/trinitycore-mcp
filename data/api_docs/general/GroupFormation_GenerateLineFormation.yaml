documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the formation index for a group arranged in a line
    formation based on member count and spacing.
  description: The GenerateLineFormation method computes a unique formation identifier
    for a group of players arranged in a linear formation. It takes into account the
    number of members in the group and the spacing between them to determine an appropriate
    formation index. This method is typically used within the context of group management
    and positioning systems in TrinityCore, particularly when handling player formations
    during group activities such as raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds. The formation
    index returned can be used to apply specific positioning logic or visual effects
    related to line-based group arrangements.
  parameters:
  - name: memberCount
    description: The number of group members to calculate the formation for. Must
      be a positive integer representing the total count of players in the group.
  - name: spacing
    description: The spacing distance between group members in the line formation.
      Should be a positive floating-point value representing the distance units between
      players.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated formation index for
    the line formation. A negative return value may indicate an error condition such
    as invalid parameters or insufficient data to compute a valid formation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Line Formation Generation
    code: 'GroupFormation formation;

      int result = formation.GenerateLineFormation(5, 2.5f);

      // Returns a formation index for a group of 5 players with 2.5 unit spacing'
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling in Line Formation
    code: "GroupFormation formation;\nint result = formation.GenerateLineFormation(0,\
      \ 1.0f);\nif (result < 0) {\n    // Handle invalid member count\n    printf(\"\
      Invalid group size for line formation\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger group positioning system and may interact
    with other formation-related methods. The exact algorithm used to calculate the
    formation index is not specified, but it's expected to consider both member count
    and spacing to produce consistent results for similar configurations.
  warnings: Ensure that both memberCount and spacing parameters are valid (positive
    values) before calling this method to avoid unexpected return values or errors.
    This method may not be thread-safe if used concurrently with other formation methods.
