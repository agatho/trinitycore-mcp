  brief: Processes and iterates through all creatures in the grid map.
  description: The Visit method of ObjectGridStoper is responsible for iterating through
    all CreatureMapType entries within the grid, performing necessary operations on
    each creature. This method is typically used during grid loading or unloading
    processes to ensure proper handling of creature objects within the game world.
    It allows for traversal and manipulation of creatures in a specific grid area,
    enabling efficient management of NPC and mob entities in the TrinityCore framework.

    code: 'ObjectGridStoper stoper;

      creatureMapType m;

      stoper.Visit(m);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the grid management system and should only be called
    during appropriate grid loading/unloading phases to avoid concurrency issues.
    The implementation assumes that the CreatureMapType container is properly initialized
    before calling this method.
