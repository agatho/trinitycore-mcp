documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ChiSystem instance with default values and internal state
    setup.
  description: The ChiSystem constructor initializes a new instance of the ChiSystem
    class, setting up internal data structures and default configurations required
    for chi-based mechanics within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically
    invoked when creating a new ChiSystem object, such as during player initialization
    or when a new chi-based ability is activated. The constructor ensures that all
    member variables are properly initialized to their default states, preparing the
    system for subsequent operations involving chi management, energy tracking, and
    related gameplay mechanics. It does not accept any parameters and performs no
    external dependencies or side effects beyond internal object setup.

  - title: Creating a new ChiSystem instance
    code: 'ChiSystem chiSystem;

      // Initializes a new ChiSystem with default settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when declaring a ChiSystem variable.
    Developers should not manually invoke this method unless creating dynamic instances.
    The initialization process includes setting up internal counters, flags, and state
    variables necessary for chi-based abilities.
