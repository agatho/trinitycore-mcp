  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: GetNearbyEnemyCount
  signature: int DemonHunterAI::GetNearbyEnemyCount(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of nearby enemy units within a specified range.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemyCount method calculates and returns the total number
    of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within the defined range around
    the DemonHunterAI's unit. This method is typically used for decision-making in
    AI behavior, such as determining when to use area-of-effect abilities or whether
    to engage in melee combat. The range parameter defines the maximum distance from
    the AI's current position to consider enemies. Enemies are counted based on their
    visibility and hostility status relative to the AI's unit.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) from the AI's current position to
      search for nearby enemies. Must be a positive value; negative or zero values
      may produce unexpected results.
  returns: An integer representing the number of enemy units found within the specified
    range. Returns 0 if no enemies are detected within range, or if the range is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int enemiesInRange = ai->GetNearbyEnemyCount(10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Enemy Count
    code: "if (ai->GetNearbyEnemyCount(8.0f) >= 3)\n{\n    // Use AoE ability\n  \
      \  ai->DoCast(SPELL_VENGEFUL_STRIKE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial search using the AI's current position and
    checks for units that are hostile, visible, and within the specified range. It
    may not account for line-of-sight or other complex detection mechanics beyond
    basic proximity.
  warnings: Ensure that the range parameter is positive to avoid undefined behavior.
    The method does not filter by unit type or health; all valid enemies within range
    are counted regardless of their specific characteristics.
