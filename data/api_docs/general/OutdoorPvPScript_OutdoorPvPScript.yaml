  class: OutdoorPvPScript
  method: OutdoorPvPScript
  signature: void OutdoorPvPScript::OutdoorPvPScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an OutdoorPvPScript with a specified name for use in World of
    Warcraft's outdoor player versus player systems.
  description: The OutdoorPvPScript constructor initializes a new instance of the
    OutdoorPvPScript class, associating it with a unique name identifier. This name
    is used internally by TrinityCore to register and manage the script within the
    outdoor PvP system. The script serves as a base class for implementing custom
    outdoor PvP behaviors, such as capturing territories, managing player interactions,
    or handling event triggers in specific zones. It must be properly registered with
    the game's outdoor PvP framework to become active. This constructor does not perform
    any complex operations but sets up the foundational structure required for the
    script to function within the game's PvP subsystem.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that uniquely identifies this OutdoorPvPScript
      instance. The name is used by the game engine to register and retrieve the script
      during outdoor PvP zone initialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic OutdoorPvPScript Initialization
    code: "class MyOutdoorPvpScript : public OutdoorPvPScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyOutdoorPvpScript()\
      \ : OutdoorPvPScript(\"MyCustomOutdoorPvp\")\n    {\n        // Constructor\
      \ body\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The name parameter should be unique across all registered OutdoorPvPScripts
    to prevent conflicts. This constructor is typically called from a derived class's
    initializer list, and the script instance must be properly registered with the
    game engine using the appropriate registration mechanism (e.g., through a global
    registry or module system).
