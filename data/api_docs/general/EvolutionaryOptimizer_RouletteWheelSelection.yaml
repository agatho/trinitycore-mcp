  brief: Selects a chromosome from the population using roulette wheel selection based
    on fitness probabilities.
  description: The RouletteWheelSelection method implements a stochastic selection
    mechanism commonly used in evolutionary algorithms. It evaluates each chromosome's
    fitness within the current population and assigns selection probability proportional
    to fitness values. Chromosomes with higher fitness have a greater chance of being
    selected, simulating natural selection pressure. This method is typically called
    during the reproduction phase of an evolutionary algorithm to determine which
    individuals will contribute genetic material to the next generation. The selection
    process ensures that better-performing strategies are more likely to be preserved
    while maintaining some diversity through probabilistic sampling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a StrategyChromosome object representing the selected individual
    from the population based on roulette wheel probability distribution. The returned
    chromosome is guaranteed to be a valid member of the current population and reflects
    the weighted selection based on fitness values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in evolutionary algorithm
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      // Assume population is initialized with fitness values

      StrategyChromosome selected = optimizer.RouletteWheelSelection();

      // Use selected chromosome for crossover/mutation operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the population has been properly initialized with
    valid fitness values before calling. The selection process is non-deterministic
    and may return different results on subsequent calls with the same population.
    Implementation typically requires that all fitness values are non-negative, as
    negative fitness values can lead to undefined behavior in probability calculations.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that fitness values have been
    computed for all chromosomes in the population. If all fitness values are zero
    or negative, the selection probabilities may become invalid or uniformly distributed,
    potentially leading to poor evolutionary convergence. The method does not validate
    input parameters beyond basic assumptions about population state.
