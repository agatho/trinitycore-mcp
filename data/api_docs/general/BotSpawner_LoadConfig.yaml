documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes bot spawning configuration settings from the database
    or configuration files.
  description: The LoadConfig method is responsible for retrieving and applying all
    relevant configuration parameters related to bot spawning within the TrinityCore
    environment. This includes loading settings such as spawn rates, bot behavior
    flags, account restrictions, and other runtime parameters that govern how and
    when bots are created and managed by the BotSpawner system. The method typically
    executes during server startup or when configuration changes are detected, ensuring
    that the bot spawning functionality operates according to defined rules and constraints.
    It may also validate loaded configurations and handle fallback defaults if required
    settings are missing.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner;

      spawner.LoadConfig();

      // Configuration is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during initialization to avoid overwriting
    previously loaded settings. It may perform database queries or file I/O operations,
    so calling it frequently could impact performance.
