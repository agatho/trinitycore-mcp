  signature: bool Unit::HasPvpFlag(UnitPVPStateFlags flags) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has PvP flag set.
  description: This method determines whether a unit (player or creature) has the
    PvP flag active, which indicates that the unit is in a PvP state and can be attacked
    by other players. The method returns true when the unit's PvP flag is set, and
    false otherwise. This functionality is essential for determining combat readiness
    and player interaction in World of Warcraft's PvP mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has PvP flag set, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->HasPvpFlag()) {\n    // Unit is in PvP state\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the unit's internal PvP state flags and may be affected
    by various game mechanics including player level differences, faction status,
    and other PvP-related conditions. Performance considerations are minimal as this
    is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a unit can attack another
    unit, as it only checks for the presence of PvP flags. Other factors such as faction
    status or level difference must also be considered for full combat readiness.
