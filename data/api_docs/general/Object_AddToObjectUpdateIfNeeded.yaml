  brief: Adds object to update list if needed for World of Warcraft server
  description: This method determines whether an object should be added to the update
    list for the current tick, typically used in the context of World of Warcraft
    server-side updates. It checks various conditions such as object visibility, movement
    status, and other relevant factors to decide if the object needs to be included
    in the update queue. The method is crucial for maintaining efficient server performance
    by avoiding unnecessary updates when objects are not actively changing or visible.

  notes: This method is typically called during server tick processing and involves
    checking visibility, movement status, and other conditions. It's important for
    performance optimization as it prevents unnecessary updates when objects are not
