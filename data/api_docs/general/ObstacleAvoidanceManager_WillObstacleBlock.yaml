  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: WillObstacleBlock
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::WillObstacleBlock(const ObstacleInfo &
    obstacle, const int & from, const int & to, float timeOffset)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an obstacle will block a path between two points at a
    given time offset.
  description: The WillObstacleBlock method evaluates if a specified obstacle will
    interfere with movement from a starting point to an ending point, taking into
    account a time offset. This is used in pathfinding and avoidance logic to determine
    if an entity's trajectory would be obstructed by the obstacle. The method considers
    the spatial relationship between the obstacle and the path, as well as temporal
    factors through the timeOffset parameter. It is typically invoked during AI behavior
    calculations or movement validation within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: obstacle
    description: Reference to an ObstacleInfo object that contains spatial data about
      the obstacle, including position, dimensions, and type.
  - name: from
    description: Integer identifier representing the starting point of the path or
      movement trajectory.
  - name: to
    description: Integer identifier representing the destination point of the path
      or movement trajectory.
  - name: timeOffset
    description: Floating-point value indicating the time offset in seconds from current
      time, used to predict future positions of moving obstacles or entities.
  returns: Returns true if the obstacle will block the path between 'from' and 'to'
    at the specified time offset; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for checking obstacle blocking
    code: "ObstacleInfo obs;\n// ... populate obs with obstacle data\nint start =\
      \ 100;\nint end = 200;\nfloat offset = 2.5f;\nbool isBlocked = obstacleManager.WillObstacleBlock(obs,\
      \ start, end, offset);\nif (isBlocked)\n{\n    // Handle path avoidance logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI movement decision making
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    ObstacleInfo currentObstacle;\n    // ... obtain\
      \ obstacle from environment\n    if (obstacleManager.WillObstacleBlock(currentObstacle,\
      \ GetPosition(), GetTargetPosition(), 1.0f))\n    {\n        SetMovementState(MOVE_STATE_AVOIDING);\n\
      \        // Adjust path or seek alternative route\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the obstacle avoidance system and relies on accurate
    spatial data for obstacles. It may be called frequently during AI updates, so
    performance optimization is important. The 'from' and 'to' parameters should represent
    valid node identifiers or positions in the navigation mesh.
  warnings: Ensure that the ObstacleInfo object passed contains valid spatial data;
    invalid or uninitialized obstacle data can lead to incorrect results. The timeOffset
    parameter must be non-negative for meaningful predictions.
