  signature: void AchievementGlobalMgr::LoadAchievementScripts()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all achievement-related scripts from the database into
    memory for processing during runtime.
  description: The LoadAchievementScripts method is responsible for retrieving all
    defined achievement scripts from the database and preparing them for execution
    when players meet specific criteria. This method typically runs during server
    startup or reload operations to ensure that all scripted achievements are properly
    registered and active. It handles parsing of script data, validation of conditions,
    and setup of internal structures needed for real-time achievement evaluation.
    The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the AchievementGlobalMgr
    singleton instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    AchievementGlobalMgr::instance()->LoadAchievementScripts();\n\
      \    // Continue with other startup procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading achievement data. It's typically invoked by the core server loading
    sequence and shouldn't be manually triggered in normal gameplay scenarios. The
    method may block briefly while reading from the database depending on the number
    of achievements defined.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    duplicate script registrations and unexpected behavior. Avoid invoking this during
    high-traffic periods as it may cause temporary performance degradation due to
    database queries and memory allocations.
