  signature: void GuardianDruid::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the guardian druid's buffs and aura states based on current combat
    conditions and spell effects.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs and auras that are currently affecting the Guardian Druid. This includes
    checking for expired buffs, applying new ones based on the druid's current state
    (such as form changes or spell casts), and ensuring proper stacking and duration
    calculations for applicable effects. The method typically runs during each AI
    update cycle to maintain accurate buff status. It interacts with the core TrinityCore
    aura system to ensure that all relevant buffs are properly applied, removed, or
    refreshed according to game mechanics and spell interactions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void GuardianDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    m_guardian->UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system during regular
    update cycles. Developers should be aware that buff updates may trigger additional
    callbacks or event handlers within the aura system, potentially affecting performance
    if many buffs are active. The method does not directly modify spell casting or
    combat state but ensures proper aura management.
