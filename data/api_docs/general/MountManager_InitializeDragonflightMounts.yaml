  class: MountManager
  method: InitializeDragonflightMounts
  signature: void MountManager::InitializeDragonflightMounts()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes Dragonflight-specific mount data and configurations for the MountManager.
  description: The InitializeDragonflightMounts method sets up all mount-related data
    specific to the Dragonflight expansion within the TrinityCore framework. This
    includes loading mount IDs, unlock requirements, and associated flags that are
    unique to Dragonflight content. The method ensures that player characters can
    properly access and utilize mounts introduced in the Dragonflight expansion upon
    login or when the game initializes. It typically runs during server startup or
    mount system initialization to populate internal data structures with Dragonflight-specific
    mount information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'MountManager* mountMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetMountManager();

      mountMgr->InitializeDragonflightMounts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when the
    mount system is first loaded. It may perform database queries to fetch Dragonflight
    mount data and populate internal lookup tables for fast access. The method should
    only be invoked once during the lifetime of the MountManager instance.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate entries or
    unexpected behavior. Ensure that it's only called after all necessary systems
    are initialized and before any player interactions with mounts occur.
