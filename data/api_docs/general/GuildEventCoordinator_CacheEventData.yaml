documentation:
  brief: Caches guild event data for the specified guild ID.
  description: The CacheEventData method retrieves and stores relevant guild event
    information for a given guild identifier. This method is typically used to preload
    or refresh cached data related to guild events, ensuring that subsequent accesses
    to guild event information are efficient and up-to-date. The caching mechanism
    helps reduce database queries and improves performance when handling frequent
    guild event lookups. It is commonly invoked during guild initialization, event
    creation, or when event data needs to be synchronized with the current state of
    the game world.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database operations to fetch event data, so frequent
    calls may impact performance. It should be used judiciously during initialization
    or when explicit cache refresh is required.
