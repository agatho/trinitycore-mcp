  class: BotAI
  method: SelectBestStrategy
  signature: Strategy * BotAI::SelectBestStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the most appropriate combat or behavior strategy for
    the bot based on current game state and conditions.
  description: The SelectBestStrategy method evaluates the current state of the bot,
    including its health, mana, target status, available spells, and other relevant
    factors to determine and return the optimal Strategy object that should be executed.
    This method is typically called during the AI update cycle to dynamically adjust
    the bot's behavior in response to changing battlefield conditions. It considers
    various strategic layers such as threat management, spell selection, positioning,
    and resource conservation. The returned strategy object contains a set of actions
    and decisions that the bot will execute next.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Strategy object representing the best available strategy
    for the current situation, or NULL if no suitable strategy can be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    Strategy* bestStrategy = SelectBestStrategy();\n\
      \    if (bestStrategy)\n    {\n        bestStrategy->Execute(this);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy selection with fallback handling
    code: "Strategy* BotAI::SelectBestStrategy()\n{\n    Strategy* strategy = SelectBestStrategy();\n\
      \    if (!strategy)\n    {\n        // Fallback to default idle behavior\n \
      \       return &defaultIdleStrategy;\n    }\n    return strategy;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making loop and should be called
    frequently during bot updates. The selection process may involve complex calculations
    including threat assessment, spell cooldowns, and target prioritization. Performance
    is critical since this method can be invoked multiple times per second.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the AI update context as it relies
    on current state variables that are only valid during active AI processing. The
    returned Strategy pointer must be checked for NULL before use to avoid potential
    crashes.
