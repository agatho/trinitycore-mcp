documentation:
  brief: Returns the motion master instance controlling unit movement behavior
  description: The GetMotionMaster method retrieves the MotionMaster object that manages
    all movement-related behaviors for a Unit. This includes pathfinding, movement
    types, and movement state handling. The returned pointer is const, meaning it
    cannot be modified directly but can be used to access movement information. In
    World of Warcraft context, this is essential for managing NPC movement patterns,
    player movement states, and various AI-driven motion behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const pointer to the MotionMaster object associated with the
    Unit, which handles all movement-related operations including pathfinding, movement
    types, and state management. The pointer may be null if no motion master has been
    initialized for the unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = ...;\nconst MotionMaster* mm = target->GetMotionMaster();\n\
      if (mm)\n{\n    // Use motion master to access movement information\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned MotionMaster pointer is typically initialized during unit creation
    or when movement is required. This method is commonly used in AI scripts and movement-related
    code where the unit's movement behavior needs to be accessed for various operations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return nullptr if
    the unit has not been properly initialized with motion master information. Also,
    accessing the MotionMaster directly without proper checks can lead to memory access
    violations.
