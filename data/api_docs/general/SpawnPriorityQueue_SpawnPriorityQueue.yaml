documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the SpawnPriorityQueue class for managing object
    spawning priorities.
  description: The SpawnPriorityQueue constructor initializes a new instance of the
    SpawnPriorityQueue class, which is used to manage and prioritize the spawning
    of game objects such as creatures, game objects, and other entities within the
    TrinityCore world. This queue ensures that objects are spawned in an ordered manner
    based on priority levels, which can be crucial for maintaining proper game state
    and avoiding conflicts during world initialization or dynamic object creation.
    The constructor sets up internal data structures required for priority-based spawning
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new SpawnPriorityQueue instance
    code: 'SpawnPriorityQueue spawnQueue;

      // The spawnQueue is now initialized and ready to use for managing object spawns'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any spawning operations itself; it only
    initializes the queue structure. Actual spawning must be performed through other
    methods of the class such as AddSpawn or ProcessSpawns.
