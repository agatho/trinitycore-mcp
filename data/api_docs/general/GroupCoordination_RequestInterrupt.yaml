  class: GroupCoordination
  method: RequestInterrupt
  signature: void GroupCoordination::RequestInterrupt(int targetGuid, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an interrupt request for a specified spell on a target player within
    the group coordination system.
  description: The RequestInterrupt method is used to signal that a spell cast by
    a group member should be interrupted. This typically occurs when another group
    member attempts to disrupt or cancel an ongoing spell cast, such as during PvP
    encounters or specific group mechanics. The method takes a target GUID and a spell
    ID to identify which spell on which player should be interrupted. It is part of
    the group coordination system that manages interactions between group members
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose spell cast is to
      be interrupted. This must correspond to a valid player within the group.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell that should be interrupted. This identifies the
      specific spell being targeted for interruption, such as a harmful spell or buff.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Interrupting a Target's Spell Cast
    code: 'GroupCoordination* gc = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordination();

      gc->RequestInterrupt(targetPlayer->GetGUID().GetCounter(), 12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during group-based spell interruption mechanics,
    such as when a player uses an ability like 'Spell Interrupt' or similar mechanics.
    It does not directly interrupt the spell but sends a request to the group coordination
    system which may then propagate this information to other players in the group.
  warnings: Ensure that the targetGuid corresponds to a valid player within the current
    group context, otherwise behavior is undefined. Also, calling this method with
    an invalid spellId may result in no action being taken or unexpected behavior.
