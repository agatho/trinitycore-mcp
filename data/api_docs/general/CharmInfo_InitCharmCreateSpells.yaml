documentation:
  brief: Initializes charm spells for a creature's charm information.
  description: The InitCharmCreateSpells method sets up the initial spell list for
    a charmable creature, typically called during the creation or initialization of
    a charm effect. This method configures which spells the creature will have available
    while under the influence of a charm effect, including any innate or learned spells
    that should be accessible to the player controlling the creature. The method is
    part of the CharmInfo class and is essential for proper charm behavior in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore emulation.

  - title: Basic Usage During Creature Initialization
    code: "void InitializeCharmSpells(Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature->HasUnitTypeMask(UnitTypeMask::UNIT_MASK_UNIT))\n\
      \    {\n        CharmInfo* charmInfo = creature->GetCharmInfo();\n        if\
      \ (charmInfo)\n        {\n            charmInfo->InitCharmCreateSpells();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a creature is charmed, and should not usually be called manually unless implementing
    custom charm mechanics. The method likely populates internal spell lists used
    for spell availability checks during charm gameplay.
