  class: LFGMgr
  method: GetQueueJoinTime
  signature: time_t LFGMgr::GetQueueJoinTime(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the timestamp when a player joined the LFG queue.
  description: The GetQueueJoinTime method returns the time_t value representing when
    a specific player joined the Looking For Group (LFG) queue. This function is typically
    used to track how long a player has been waiting in the queue, which can be useful
    for various game mechanics such as queue time limits, reward calculations, or
    debugging queue behavior. The method takes a GUID (Global Unique Identifier) of
    the player as input and returns the Unix timestamp of when that player entered
    the LFG queue. If the player is not currently in any LFG queue, the method may
    return 0 or an invalid timestamp depending on implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The Global Unique Identifier (GUID) of the player whose queue join
      time is to be retrieved. This should correspond to a valid player in the game
      world.
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the player joined the
    LFG queue. Returns 0 if the player is not found in any active LFG queue or if
    an error occurs during lookup.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a player's queue join time
    code: "time_t joinTime = sLFGMgr->GetQueueJoinTime(playerGuid);\nif (joinTime\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player joined the queue at: \" << ctime(&joinTime)\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player is not in any LFG queue.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal LFG manager state tracking. It assumes that
    the provided GUID corresponds to a valid player entity within the game world.
    The returned timestamp is in UTC and represents seconds since Unix epoch.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this function is valid and refers to an
    actual player, otherwise the behavior may be undefined or return incorrect results.
    This method should not be called from outside the main game thread without proper
    synchronization.
