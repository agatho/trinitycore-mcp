  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: SetLastQueueTime
  signature: void LFGBotSelector::SetLastQueueTime(int botGuid, time_t queueTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the last queue time for a specific bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The SetLastQueueTime method is used to record or update the timestamp
    of when a particular bot last queued for a group finder activity. This functionality
    is essential for managing bot behavior in World of Warcraft's LFG (Looking For
    Group) system, ensuring that bots do not queue too frequently and maintain realistic
    cooldown periods between group requests. The method accepts a bot's unique identifier
    (GUID) and the time at which it queued, storing this information internally for
    future reference or decision-making processes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose last queue time is
      being updated. This value must be a valid integer representing a bot's GUID
      within the TrinityCore system.
  - name: queueTime
    description: The timestamp indicating when the bot queued for a group. This should
      be a valid time_t value, typically obtained from std::time(nullptr) or similar
      functions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LFGBotSelector selector;

      int botGuid = 12345;

      time_t currentTime = std::time(nullptr);

      selector.SetLastQueueTime(botGuid, currentTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other LFG bot management
    functions to enforce realistic cooldowns and prevent spamming of group requests.
    It's important that the botGuid corresponds to an actual registered bot within
    the system for this function to have meaningful effect.
