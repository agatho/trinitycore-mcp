documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the gathering while moving feature for the player.
  description: The SetGatherWhileMoving method controls whether a player can gather
    resources (such as herbs, ores, or minerals) while moving. When enabled, players
    can collect materials without stopping their movement, which enhances gameplay
    flow and efficiency during resource gathering. This setting typically affects
    all gathering activities for the player and may be toggled based on user preferences
    or game state conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value that determines whether gathering while moving is
      enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Gathering While Moving
    code: 'GatheringManager* manager = player->GetGatheringManager();

      manager->SetGatherWhileMoving(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Gathering While Moving
    code: 'GatheringManager* manager = player->GetGatheringManager();

      manager->SetGatherWhileMoving(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags within the GatheringManager class
    that control movement behavior during gathering actions. Changes made using this
    method may not take effect immediately and could depend on the current state of
    the player's movement or gathering session.
