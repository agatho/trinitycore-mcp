  method: UpdateProcTimers
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::UpdateProcTimers(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the timers for all active procs in the combat specialization.
  description: The UpdateProcTimers method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers associated with proc-based abilities within a combat specialization.
    This method is typically called during each update cycle to decrement the internal
    timers of active procs, allowing them to expire and become available for triggering
    again. It ensures that procs respect their cooldown periods and do not trigger
    more frequently than allowed by game mechanics. The method processes all currently
    active procs in the specialization, reducing their remaining time by the specified
    delta time (diff) and handling any expired procs appropriately.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to accurately decrement proc timers based on real-time elapsed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void Player::UpdateCombat(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other combat logic\
      \ ...\n    _combatSpecialization->UpdateProcTimers(diff);\n    // ... rest of\
      \ update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat System Timer
    code: "void CombatSystem::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& player : _players)\n\
      \    {\n        if (player->HasCombatSpecialization())\n        {\n        \
      \    player->GetCombatSpecialization()->UpdateProcTimers(diff);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure proper
    proc timing. It's important that the diff parameter accurately reflects the time
    elapsed since the last call to maintain consistent cooldown behavior across different
    frame rates and system loads.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter can lead to incorrect proc timing,
    potentially causing procs to trigger too frequently or not at all. Ensure this
    method is called with accurate time deltas from the game loop.
