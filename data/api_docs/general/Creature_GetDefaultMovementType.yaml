  brief: Returns the default movement type for a creature.
  description: This method retrieves the movement type that is set as the default
    for a creature instance. It provides information about how the creature should
    move by default, which can be used to determine the behavior of the creature in
    various game scenarios. The returned value represents the movement type that is
    typically applied to creatures when they are created or initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'The return value represents a MovementGeneratorType enum value indicating
    the default movement type for the creature. Possible values include: IDLE, RANDOM,
    WAYPOINT, and others depending on the creature''s configuration and behavior.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "MovementGeneratorType type = creature->GetDefaultMovementType();\nif (type\
      \ == MOVEMENTGENERATOR_TYPE_IDLE)\n{\n    // Handle idle movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to determine the default behavior of a creature. It may be overridden
    by specific movement generators or AI behaviors depending on the creature's state.
