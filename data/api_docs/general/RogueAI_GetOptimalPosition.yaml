  class: RogueAI
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int RogueAI::GetOptimalPosition(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position for a rogue to move to while
    engaging a target.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best location for a Rogue
    AI character to position itself relative to its current target. This calculation
    takes into account factors such as the rogue's melee range, the target's positioning,
    and environmental constraints to ensure optimal combat effectiveness. The method
    is typically used during AI decision-making processes when the rogue needs to
    reposition for better attack opportunities or to maintain distance from threats.
    It returns an integer value representing a position identifier or offset that
    can be used by the AI system to execute movement commands.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position.
      This parameter is used to calculate relative positioning and distance metrics
      for optimal placement.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the calculated optimal position. The
    exact meaning of this value depends on the internal implementation, but it typically
    represents either a position index, offset, or coordinate value that can be interpreted
    by the AI movement system to determine where the rogue should move.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nint optimalPos = rogueAI->GetOptimalPosition(&targetId);\n\
      // Use optimalPos to determine movement direction or target position\nif (optimalPos\
      \ != -1) {\n    // Execute movement to calculated position\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision making
    code: "class RogueAI {\npublic:\n    int GetOptimalPosition(int* target) {\n \
      \       // Implementation would calculate optimal positioning\n        // based\
      \ on target location, rogue's abilities, and combat state\n        return 42;\
      \ // Placeholder return value\n    }\n};\n\n// In main AI loop:\nint currentTarget\
      \ = player->GetGUID();\nint position = ai->GetOptimalPosition(&currentTarget);\n\
      if (position > 0) {\n    // Move to calculated optimal position\n    MoveToPosition(position);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Rogue AI subsystem and should only be called when
    the rogue has a valid target. The actual positioning logic may vary based on the
    rogue's current abilities, gear, and combat state. Performance-wise, this method
    should execute quickly as it's called frequently during combat decision-making
    cycles.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid target before calling
    this method, as invalid or null targets may lead to undefined behavior. The returned
    position value must be properly validated before being used for movement commands
    to prevent potential AI errors or character movement issues.
