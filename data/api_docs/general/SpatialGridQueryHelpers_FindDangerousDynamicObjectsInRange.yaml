  class: SpatialGridQueryHelpers
  method: FindDangerousDynamicObjectsInRange
  signature: int SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindDangerousDynamicObjectsInRange(Player
    * bot, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Finds dangerous dynamic objects within a specified range of the player.
  description: The FindDangerousDynamicObjectsInRange method searches for dynamic
    objects in the player's vicinity that are considered dangerous, such as traps
    or harmful game effects. It iterates through the spatial grid cells around the
    player and identifies any dynamic objects flagged as dangerous within the given
    range. The method returns a count of how many such objects were found. This functionality
    is commonly used by AI systems to avoid hazardous areas or to determine safe paths
    for movement. The method assumes that the player object is valid and that the
    world environment has been properly initialized.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which to search for dangerous dynamic
      objects.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance in yards to search for dangerous dynamic objects
      around the player.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of dangerous dynamic objects
    found within the specified range. A return value of zero indicates no dangerous
    objects were detected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int dangerousCount = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindDangerousDynamicObjectsInRange(player,\
      \ 10.0f);\nif (dangerousCount > 0)\n{\n    // Handle dangerous objects found\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Found %d dangerous objects nearby.\", dangerousCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with AI Decision Making
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nfloat searchRange =\
      \ 15.0f;\nint dangerCount = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindDangerousDynamicObjectsInRange(bot,\
      \ searchRange);\nif (dangerCount > 0)\n{\n    // Avoid the area or take evasive\
      \ action\n    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MoveIdle();\n    sLog->outString(\"Avoiding\
      \ dangerous area with %d objects detected.\", dangerCount);\n}\nelse\n{\n  \
      \  // Proceed normally\n    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MoveTargetedHome();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the spatial grid system to efficiently query nearby
    dynamic objects. Performance may be affected if many dynamic objects exist in
    the area. The range parameter should be carefully chosen to balance between detection
    accuracy and performance impact.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The method does not
    perform any safety checks on the player's current location or state.
