documentation:
  brief: Updates spell interactions for affected targets and handles related game
    mechanics.
  description: The EffectUpdateInteractions method is responsible for updating the
    state of spell effects on targets, particularly handling interactions between
    multiple spell effects or aura states. This method ensures that spell effects
    properly update their behavior based on changes in target status, such as health
    modifications, debuff stacking, or interaction with other active spells. It typically
    operates during spell tick updates or when specific conditions are met within
    the spell's lifecycle. The method may also manage cleanup of expired interactions
    or trigger additional effects based on current spell states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Update Loop
    code: "void Spell::UpdateSpellEffects()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    EffectUpdateInteractions();\n    // ... continue with remaining updates\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system during spell
    tick processing. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom spell behavior. The method may modify target states and should be used
    carefully in contexts where state consistency is critical.
  warnings: Calling EffectUpdateInteractions manually can lead to inconsistent spell
    states or unexpected interactions between effects. This method modifies internal
    spell and target states, so it should only be invoked during appropriate spell
    update cycles.
