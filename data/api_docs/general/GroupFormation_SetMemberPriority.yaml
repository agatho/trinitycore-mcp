  signature: void GroupFormation::SetMemberPriority(uint32 memberGuid, float priority)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the priority value for a group member, influencing formation behavior
    and positioning.
  description: The SetMemberPriority method assigns a floating-point priority value
    to a specific group member identified by their GUID. This priority affects how
    the group formation system positions the member within the group layout, with
    higher values typically indicating more preferred placement. The method is used
    internally by the group formation logic to dynamically adjust positioning based
    on player roles or preferences. It does not validate the GUID or priority range,
    so callers should ensure valid inputs to avoid unexpected behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member whose priority is
      being set. Must correspond to a valid player in the current group.
  - name: priority
    description: A floating-point value representing the member's priority within
      the group formation. Higher values indicate higher priority for preferred positioning.
      Negative values are allowed but may be interpreted as lower priority or invalid.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set a high-priority member
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->SetMemberPriority(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), 10.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjust priority for tank role
    code: 'Player* tank = ...; // Assume tank player is obtained

      GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->SetMemberPriority(tank->GetGUID().GetCounter(), 15.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal group formation data structures. It
    should be called carefully during group operations to avoid conflicts with other
    formation logic. The priority values are used in sorting algorithms for positioning,
    so consistent updates are recommended for stable behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent member GUID may lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure the member is actually part of the group before
    setting their priority. Also, frequent calls to this method without proper throttling
    may impact performance in large groups.
