  method: NextGroupUpdateSequenceNumber
  signature: int32 Player::NextGroupUpdateSequenceNumber(GroupCategory category)
documentation:
  brief: Increments and returns the next group update sequence number for the specified
    group category.
  description: The NextGroupUpdateSequenceNumber method is used to manage sequential
    tracking of group-related updates within a player's context. It increments an
    internal counter associated with the given GroupCategory and returns the new value.
    This mechanism helps ensure that group updates are processed in order and can
    be used for synchronization purposes, particularly when dealing with group member
    changes, loot distribution, or other group-based events. The method is typically
    called internally by the TrinityCore framework during group operations to maintain
    consistency of group state across the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a 32-bit signed integer representing the incremented sequence number
    for the specified group category. This value should be treated as a unique identifier
    for the current update cycle within that category.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group update context
    code: 'int32 newSequence = player->NextGroupUpdateSequenceNumber(GROUP_CATEGORY_INSTANCE);

      // Use newSequence to track instance group updates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal tracking system for maintaining
    order in group-related operations. The sequence numbers may be used for client-server
    synchronization, ensuring that updates are applied in the correct temporal order.
