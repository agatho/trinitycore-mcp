  method: GetSearcherTypeMaskForCondition
  signature: uint32 Condition::GetSearcherTypeMaskForCondition() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the searcher type mask associated with this condition for use in
    conditional evaluations.
  description: The GetSearcherTypeMaskForCondition method retrieves a bitmask that
    defines which types of objects (such as players, creatures, game objects, etc.)
    can be considered as potential searchers when evaluating this condition. This
    mask is used internally by the condition system to filter valid targets during
    conditional checks, ensuring that only appropriate object types are evaluated
    against the condition's criteria. The returned value typically corresponds to
    predefined searcher type constants defined within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 bitmask representing allowed searcher types for this condition.
    Each bit in the mask corresponds to a specific searcher type (e.g., player, creature,
    game object), with set bits indicating that the respective type is permitted as
    a searcher during condition evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Condition* cond = sConditionMgr->GetCondition(ConditionType::CONDITION_SOURCE_ENTITY,\
      \ 12345);\nuint32 mask = cond->GetSearcherTypeMaskForCondition();\nif (mask\
      \ & SEARCHER_TYPE_PLAYER)\n{\n    // This condition can be evaluated with player\
      \ searchers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the condition system's
    internal evaluation logic. The mask returned should be checked against predefined
    searcher type constants like SEARCHER_TYPE_PLAYER, SEARCHER_TYPE_CREATURE, etc.,
    to determine which object types are valid for evaluating this specific condition.
