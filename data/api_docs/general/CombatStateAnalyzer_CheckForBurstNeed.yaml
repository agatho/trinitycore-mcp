documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a burst ability or spell should be cast based on current
    combat state and cooldowns.
  description: The CheckForBurstNeed method evaluates the current combat situation
    to decide if it's optimal to use a burst ability or spell. This typically involves
    checking for specific conditions such as target health thresholds, available mana,
    cooldown status of the ability, and overall combat flow. The method is commonly
    used in AI decision-making logic for determining when to unleash high-damage bursts
    during encounters. It returns true if the conditions are met for casting a burst
    ability, otherwise false.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current combat state indicates that a burst ability
    should be cast; returns false otherwise. The decision is based on factors like
    target vulnerability, resource availability, and cooldown status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (analyzer.CheckForBurstNeed()) {\n    // Cast burst ability\n    unit->CastSpell(target,\
      \ BURST_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Evaluation
    code: "void AIUpdate(Unit* unit) {\n    CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer(unit);\n\
      \    if (analyzer.CheckForBurstNeed()) {\n        // Execute burst strategy\n\
      \        DoBurstStrategy(unit);\n    } else {\n        // Continue normal combat\n\
      \        DoNormalCombat(unit);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and relies on accurate
    state tracking of the unit's current resources, target status, and ability cooldowns.
    It may be used in conjunction with other combat analysis methods to build a comprehensive
    decision-making framework.
  warnings: The method assumes that all relevant combat state information has been
    properly updated before calling. Failing to maintain up-to-date unit states can
    lead to incorrect burst decisions. Additionally, this method should not be called
    in high-frequency loops without proper throttling to avoid performance issues.
