documentation:
  brief: Assigns a BotAI instance to this bot session for AI behavior control
  description: The SetAI method assigns a BotAI object to the current BotSession,
    enabling the bot to utilize the specified AI implementation for decision-making
    and behavior execution. This method is typically called during bot initialization
    or when switching between different AI strategies. The assigned AI instance controls
    how the bot responds to game events, makes decisions about movement and actions,
    and interacts with the game world. The method does not validate whether the provided
    BotAI pointer is valid, so callers must ensure the AI object remains alive for
    the duration of the bot's existence.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will control this bot session's
      behavior. Must be a valid BotAI object or nullptr to clear the current AI assignment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Assignment
    code: 'BotSession* session = ...;

      BotAI* ai = new BasicBotAI();

      session->SetAI(ai);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Current AI
    code: 'BotSession* session = ...;

      session->SetAI(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly assigns the AI pointer without incrementing reference
    counts. The caller is responsible for managing the lifetime of the BotAI object
    to prevent dangling pointers. The method does not perform any validation on the
    AI parameter, so invalid pointers may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null BotAI pointer can result in crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the BotAI instance remains valid for the entire lifetime
    of the bot session. This method should only be called during safe periods when
    no AI operations are actively running.
