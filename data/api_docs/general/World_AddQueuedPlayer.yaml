  class: World
  method: AddQueuedPlayer
  signature: void World::AddQueuedPlayer(WorldSession * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player session to the queued player list for login processing.
  description: The AddQueuedPlayer method is responsible for adding a WorldSession
    object representing a player's connection to the server's queue of pending logins.
    This method is typically invoked during the initial connection handshake when
    a client attempts to log in, ensuring that the player session is properly registered
    in the system's login queue before authentication and character loading processes
    begin. The queued player will be processed according to the server's login queue
    management system, which may include handling concurrent connections, enforcing
    login limits, or managing connection timeouts.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the player's active
      session. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid session
      that has been initialized but not yet fully authenticated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Queuing a new player session
    code: 'WorldSession* session = new WorldSession(1, "127.0.0.1");

      // Initialize session...

      world->AddQueuedPlayer(session);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server's connection handling
    logic and should not be invoked directly by game logic modules unless implementing
    custom login flow. The method does not perform any authentication checks; it simply
    queues the session for processing.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null session pointer will likely result in
    a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that all session objects passed to this
    method are properly initialized and valid before queuing.
