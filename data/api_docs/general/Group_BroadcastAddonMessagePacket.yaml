  method: BroadcastAddonMessagePacket
  signature: void Group::BroadcastAddonMessagePacket(const WorldPacket * packet, const
    int & prefix, bool ignorePlayersInBGRaid, int group, int ignore) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends an addon message packet to all group members, optionally ignoring certain
    players based on parameters.
  description: The BroadcastAddonMessagePacket method sends a WorldPacket containing
    addon data to all members of the group. It supports filtering out specific players
    from receiving the message through various ignore flags and group identifiers.
    This functionality is commonly used for addon communication within group contexts
    such as raids or dungeons. The method respects player status in battlegrounds
    and raid groups when applying filters, ensuring that messages are sent appropriately
    based on game context.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: A pointer to the WorldPacket containing the addon message data to
      be broadcasted to group members.
  - name: prefix
    description: An integer identifier used as a prefix for the addon message, typically
      representing the addon or message type.
  - name: ignorePlayersInBGRaid
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to ignore players who are currently
      in a battleground or raid group when broadcasting the message.
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier specifying which subgroup (if any) within the
      group should receive the message. A value of -1 indicates all subgroups.
  - name: ignore
    description: An integer flag used to specify additional ignore conditions for
      players who should not receive the broadcast message.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Addon Message Broadcast
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_ADDON_MESSAGE, 100);

      // ... populate packet with data ...

      group->BroadcastAddonMessagePacket(&packet, 12345, true, -1, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcast to Specific Subgroup with Ignore Flags
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_ADDON_MESSAGE, 50);

      // ... populate packet with data ...

      group->BroadcastAddonMessagePacket(&packet, 98765, false, 0, 1); // Send to
      subgroup 0, ignore player with flag 1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for inter-addon communication within group
    contexts. It ensures that messages are properly filtered based on group membership
    and player status (e.g., in battlegrounds). The prefix parameter allows distinguishing
    between different types of addon messages, while the ignore flags provide fine-grained
    control over who receives the message.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the ignore flags as incorrect values may result
    in unintended players receiving or not receiving addon messages. Ensure that the
    WorldPacket passed is properly formatted and contains valid data before broadcasting
    to avoid corrupting communication channels.
