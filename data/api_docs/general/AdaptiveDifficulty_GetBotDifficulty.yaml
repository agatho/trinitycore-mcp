  signature: float AdaptiveDifficulty::GetBotDifficulty(BotAI * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the difficulty level adjustment factor for a bot AI
    instance.
  description: The GetBotDifficulty method computes a floating-point value that represents
    how difficulty should be adjusted for a specific bot AI instance within the AdaptiveDifficulty
    system. This value is typically used to scale enemy behavior, loot drops, or experience
    rewards based on the bot's current state and configuration. The method takes into
    account various factors such as the bot's level, player count, and game progression
    to determine an appropriate difficulty multiplier. It serves as a core component
    in TrinityCore's adaptive difficulty system for NPC and bot encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the difficulty adjustment factor for the given
    bot AI instance. Values typically range from 0.5 to 2.0, where 1.0 represents
    normal difficulty, values below 1.0 indicate easier difficulty, and values above
    1.0 indicate harder difficulty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI context
    code: 'float difficulty = adaptiveDifficulty.GetBotDifficulty(bot);

      // Use the difficulty factor to adjust bot behavior

      bot->SetDifficultyMultiplier(difficulty);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using difficulty factor for experience calculation
    code: 'float baseXP = 100.0f;

      float difficultyFactor = adaptiveDifficulty.GetBotDifficulty(bot);

      uint32 adjustedXP = static_cast<uint32>(baseXP * difficultyFactor);

      player->AddExperience(adjustedXP);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's Adaptive Difficulty system which dynamically
    adjusts game encounters based on player performance and configuration. The returned
    value may vary between calls as it depends on runtime conditions such as player
    count, bot state, and server settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause undefined behavior. This method
    should only be called during active bot AI processing phases.
