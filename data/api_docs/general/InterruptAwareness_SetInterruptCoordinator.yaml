    coordinator)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the interrupt coordinator for this interrupt awareness instance.
  description: The SetInterruptCoordinator method assigns an InterruptCoordinator
    object to the current InterruptAwareness instance. This allows the awareness component
    to coordinate and manage interruptible actions within the game context, such as
    spell interruptions or ability cancellations. The method accepts a shared pointer
    to an InterruptCoordinator, which is typically used by systems that need to track
    or control when certain actions can be interrupted. This is commonly used in combat
    systems where abilities may be interrupted by incoming damage or other events.
    The assignment replaces any previously set coordinator and ensures thread-safe
    access through the shared pointer semantics.
  parameters:
  - name: coordinator
    description: A shared pointer to an InterruptCoordinator object that will manage
      interrupt-related logic for this awareness instance. Must not be null or invalid.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<InterruptCoordinator> coordinator = std::make_shared<InterruptCoordinator>();

      interruptAwareness.SetInterruptCoordinator(coordinator);'
    language: cpp
  - title: With Null Check
    code: "if (coordinator != nullptr) {\n    interruptAwareness.SetInterruptCoordinator(coordinator);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses a shared pointer for thread-safe management of the coordinator
    object. The InterruptAwareness class likely relies on the coordinator to determine
    interrupt conditions and propagate interruption events throughout the system.
    Ensure that the coordinator remains valid for as long as it is referenced by this
    awareness instance.
  warnings: Passing a null shared_ptr may lead to undefined behavior or crashes if
    the code does not properly validate input before using the coordinator. Avoid
    setting the coordinator multiple times without ensuring proper cleanup of previous
    references.
