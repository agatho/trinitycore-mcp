  class: PositionManager
  method: GetPositionSuccessRate
  signature: float PositionManager::GetPositionSuccessRate(const int & pos, float
    radius)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the success rate of position validation within a specified
    radius.
  description: The GetPositionSuccessRate method evaluates the likelihood that a given
    position is valid or acceptable within the context of game mechanics, such as
    spell targeting, movement validation, or NPC pathfinding. It takes into account
    factors like terrain, object collisions, and spatial constraints to determine
    how likely a position is to be successfully occupied or used by game entities.
    The method operates on a provided position coordinate and a radius parameter that
    defines the area of influence for the calculation. This function is typically
    used in scenarios where precise positioning is critical for gameplay behavior,
    such as during combat actions, movement validation, or AI decision-making processes.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: A reference to an integer representing the position identifier or
      index within the PositionManager's internal data structure. This value typically
      corresponds to a specific coordinate or location in the game world.
  - name: radius
    description: A floating-point value defining the radius around the specified position
      to consider for success rate calculation. Larger radii may include more potential
      obstacles or constraints, affecting the computed success rate.
  returns: Returns a float value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no chance
    of successful positioning and 1.0 indicates complete certainty of valid positioning
    within the specified radius.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PositionManager* posMgr = ...;

      int positionId = 12345;

      float successRate = posMgr->GetPositionSuccessRate(positionId, 5.0f);

      // successRate now contains the calculated success rate for position 12345 within
      a 5-unit radius'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "PositionManager* posMgr = ...;\nfloat radius = 10.0f;\nint targetPos =\
      \ GetTargetPosition();\nfloat rate = posMgr->GetPositionSuccessRate(targetPos,\
      \ radius);\nif (rate > 0.7f) {\n    // Proceed with action that requires valid\
      \ positioning\n    ExecuteAction();\n} else {\n    // Find alternative position\
      \ or abort\n    FindAlternativePosition();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform computationally intensive checks involving collision
    detection and spatial queries. It's recommended to cache results when possible,
    especially in performance-sensitive contexts like AI updates or real-time movement
    calculations. The exact implementation details of how the success rate is calculated
    are not exposed but likely involve internal algorithms for pathfinding validation
    and obstacle avoidance.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided position identifier is valid and
    exists within the PositionManager's data structures. Passing invalid position
    IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Additionally, floating-point
    precision issues could affect calculations when dealing with very small or very
    large radius values.
