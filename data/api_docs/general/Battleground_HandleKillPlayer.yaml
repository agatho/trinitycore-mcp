  method: HandleKillPlayer
  signature: void Battleground::HandleKillPlayer(Player * player, Player * killer)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the death of a player in a battleground, updating scores and handling
    kill-related logic.
  description: The HandleKillPlayer method is responsible for managing the consequences
    of a player being killed during a battleground match. It updates the killer's
    score, handles honor point distribution, processes loot drops if applicable, and
    manages the player's respawn mechanics. This method ensures that all necessary
    game state changes occur when a player dies in a competitive environment such
    as Warsong Gulch or Arathi Basin. The method is typically invoked internally by
    the battleground system when a player's health reaches zero during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that has been killed. This parameter
      represents the victim in the kill event.
  - name: killer
    description: Pointer to the Player object responsible for the kill. This parameter
      represents the attacker who caused the death.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within battleground context
    code: "void MyBattleground::OnPlayerDeath(Player* player, Player* killer)\n{\n\
      \    HandleKillPlayer(player, killer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom kill handling with additional logic
    code: "void CustomBattleground::HandleKillPlayer(Player* player, Player* killer)\n\
      {\n    // Call base implementation\n    Battleground::HandleKillPlayer(player,\
      \ killer);\n    \n    // Additional custom behavior\n    if (killer && player)\n\
      \    {\n        // Award bonus points or modify stats\n        killer->ModifyHonorPoints(50);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core battleground infrastructure and should not
    be called directly from outside the battleground context. It relies on internal
    state tracking to properly update player statistics and game scores. The method
    assumes both player pointers are valid and that the players are actually participating
    in the current battleground.
  warnings: Do not call this method with null pointers as it will likely cause crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that both player and killer are valid participants
    in the current battleground before invoking this method. Improper usage can lead
    to incorrect scoring, missing loot drops, or broken game state.
