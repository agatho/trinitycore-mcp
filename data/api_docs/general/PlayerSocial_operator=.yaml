  signature: PlayerSocial & PlayerSocial::operator=(PlayerSocial && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the social list data from one PlayerSocial object to another.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment of the PlayerSocial
    object, transferring all social list data (friendships, ignores, etc.) from the
    source object to the target object. This is a move operation that leaves the source
    object in a valid but unspecified state. The method is typically used when reassigning
    or swapping social data between player instances, such as during player logout/login
    cycles or when transferring social information between different player contexts.
    It's important to note that this operation does not perform deep copying of the
    underlying data structures, but rather transfers ownership of the resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target PlayerSocial object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Move Assignment Example
    code: 'PlayerSocial social1;

      PlayerSocial social2 = std::move(social1); // Uses operator=

      // social1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // social2 contains all the original data from social1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which is efficient for transferring
    large data structures. The source object after move assignment should not be used
    until it's reassigned or destroyed. This operation is commonly used internally
    by TrinityCore when managing player sessions and social data during player transitions.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the source object is not accessed after a move operation.
    Also note that this is a move assignment, not a copy assignment, so it's not appropriate
    for sharing social data between multiple players.
