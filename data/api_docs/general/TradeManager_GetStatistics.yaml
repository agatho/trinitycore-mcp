documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current trading statistics for the trade manager instance
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the TradeStatistics
    object that contains aggregated data about trading activities within the system.
    This includes information such as total trades executed, successful trades, failed
    trades, and other relevant metrics. The returned statistics are updated in real-time
    as trading operations occur, making this method useful for monitoring and analyzing
    trade behavior. This method does not modify any internal state of the TradeManager
    and is safe to call from multiple threads concurrently.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a TradeStatistics object containing detailed trading
    metrics and statistics. The reference remains valid for the lifetime of the TradeManager
    instance and should not be stored or used after the manager has been destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'const TradeStatistics& stats = tradeManager.GetStatistics();

      uint32 totalTrades = stats.total_trades;

      uint32 successfulTrades = stats.successful_trades;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Trade Performance
    code: "void PrintTradeSummary(TradeManager& manager) {\n    const TradeStatistics&\
      \ stats = manager.GetStatistics();\n    std::cout << \"Total Trades: \" << stats.total_trades\
      \ << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Success Rate: \" << (stats.total_trades\
      \ ? (stats.successful_trades * 100.0 / stats.total_trades) : 0.0) << \"%\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned TradeStatistics reference points to internal data structures
    that are updated atomically. This method is designed for read-only access and
    should not be used to modify trading statistics directly. The statistics object
    may contain additional fields beyond those mentioned in the basic description,
    depending on the specific implementation.
  warnings: Do not store the returned reference beyond the lifetime of the TradeManager
    instance, as this will result in undefined behavior. While the method itself is
    thread-safe, the data it returns may change between calls if other threads are
    performing trades simultaneously.
