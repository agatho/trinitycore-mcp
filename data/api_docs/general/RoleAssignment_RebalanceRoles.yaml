  class: RoleAssignment
  method: RebalanceRoles
  signature: void RoleAssignment::RebalanceRoles(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Rebalances group roles based on current player assignments and group composition.
  description: The RebalanceRoles method in the RoleAssignment class redistributes
    group roles (such as Tank, Healer, Damage Dealer) among group members to optimize
    team performance. This method ensures that each role type has appropriate players
    assigned according to predefined rules or game mechanics. It typically gets invoked
    when group composition changes, such as when a player joins or leaves the group,
    or during specific gameplay events requiring role adjustments. The method operates
    on a provided Group object and modifies internal role assignments accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Rebalancing
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    RoleAssignment\
      \ roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.RebalanceRoles(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    group updates. Developers should not manually invoke this unless implementing
    custom group management logic. The rebalancing algorithm may consider player class,
    level, and gear to determine optimal role distribution.
  warnings: Invoking RebalanceRoles on a NULL group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the Group object is valid and contains at least one member
    before calling this method.
