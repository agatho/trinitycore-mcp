api:
  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: TrainDifficultyCurve
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::TrainDifficultyCurve(int playerGuid, float skill,
    float optimalDifficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the difficulty curve for a player based on their skill level and
    optimal difficulty.
  description: The TrainDifficultyCurve method adjusts the adaptive difficulty settings
    for a specific player within the TrinityCore framework. It takes into account
    the player's current skill level and the optimal difficulty they should be facing
    to maintain an engaging gameplay experience. This method is typically used in
    dynamic difficulty adjustment systems where the game modifies challenge levels
    based on player performance. The method updates internal tracking mechanisms that
    influence how future encounters are scaled for this particular player.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: Unique identifier of the player whose difficulty curve is being trained.
      Must be a valid GUID present in the game world.
  - name: skill
    description: Current skill level of the player, typically representing their proficiency
      or performance metrics in the game. Should be a positive floating-point value.
  - name: optimalDifficulty
    description: Target difficulty level that the system aims to achieve for this
      player. Represents the desired challenge level based on skill assessment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: AdaptiveDifficulty::TrainDifficultyCurve(12345, 75.5f, 80.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Update Loop
    code: "void OnPlayerSkillUpdate(Player* player)\n{\n    float currentSkill = player->GetSkillLevel();\n\
      \    float optimal = CalculateOptimalDifficulty(player);\n    AdaptiveDifficulty::TrainDifficultyCurve(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ currentSkill, optimal);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal data structures that track player difficulty
    preferences and may influence future encounter scaling. It's designed to be called
    during gameplay when player performance data is available. The implementation
    may involve caching or queuing mechanisms for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid corresponds to an active player in the game
    world, otherwise behavior is undefined. The skill and optimalDifficulty parameters
    should be validated before calling to prevent unexpected difficulty adjustments.
