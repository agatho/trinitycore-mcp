  class: WarriorAI
  method: ExecuteBasicWarriorRotation
  signature: void WarriorAI::ExecuteBasicWarriorRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the basic warrior AI rotation against a specified target.
  description: The ExecuteBasicWarriorRotation method performs the core combat logic
    for a WarriorAI instance, determining and executing appropriate abilities based
    on the current game state and target conditions. This method typically handles
    ability selection, cooldown management, and targeting decisions to optimize damage
    output or survival mechanics depending on the warrior's specialization and current
    fight context. The method assumes that a valid target exists and that the AI has
    been properly initialized with necessary resources such as spell data and combat
    parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      Must be a valid unit reference; null or invalid pointers will result in undefined
      behavior.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    ExecuteBasicWarriorRotation(mVictim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom combat logic
    code: "void WarriorAI::DoCombatAction()\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n\n    Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO);\n\
      \    if (target && target->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        ExecuteBasicWarriorRotation(target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI update loop and should not
    be invoked directly from outside the AI framework without proper context setup.
    The warrior's rotation logic may vary based on specialization (Arms, Fury, Protection)
    and current gear state. Ensure that the target parameter is always valid before
    calling this method to avoid crashes or unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid target pointer will likely
    cause a crash or undefined behavior. This method modifies the AI's internal state
    and should not be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization
    mechanisms.
