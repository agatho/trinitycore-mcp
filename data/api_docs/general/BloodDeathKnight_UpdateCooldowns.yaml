documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldowns for the Blood Death Knight's abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method manages and updates the internal cooldown
    timers for all abilities available to the Blood Death Knight class. This method
    is typically called during each update cycle of the game loop to ensure that cooldowns
    are properly tracked and decremented. It handles the logic for when abilities
    become available again after their cooldown period has elapsed, ensuring proper
    gameplay balance and adherence to class-specific mechanics. The method processes
    all active cooldowns for the Death Knight's abilities, including both player-initiated
    actions and passive effects that may have cooldowns.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    _bloodDeathKnight.UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \    // ... rest of game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core game update system and should
    not be called manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. The 'diff' parameter
    represents the time elapsed since the last update in milliseconds, which is used
    to accurately decrement cooldown timers.
