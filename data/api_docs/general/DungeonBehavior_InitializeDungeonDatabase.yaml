documentation:
  brief: Initializes the dungeon database for the DungeonBehavior instance, setting
    up required tables and configurations.
  description: The InitializeDungeonDatabase method prepares the internal database
    structures necessary for managing dungeon-related data within the DungeonBehavior
    class. This includes creating or verifying the existence of essential tables,
    initializing configuration settings, and ensuring that all required database connections
    are established. The method is typically called during the initialization phase
    of a dungeon instance to ensure that all dungeon-specific data can be properly
    stored and retrieved. It performs setup operations that are critical for the proper
    functioning of dungeon mechanics such as player tracking, loot distribution, and
    event management.

    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeon;

      dungeon.InitializeDungeonDatabase();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of a dungeon
    instance. Repeated calls may result in unnecessary overhead or potential database
    inconsistencies. The method assumes that the core TrinityCore database connection
    is already established.
