documentation:
  brief: Loads player choice data from the database into memory for use during gameplay.
  description: The LoadPlayerChoices method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures with player choice records stored in the database. This method
    is typically called during server startup or world loading phases to ensure that
    all player choice options, such as those used in quest rewards, gossip selections,
    and other interactive dialog systems, are available for runtime use. It processes
    entries from the playerchoice table and related tables, mapping them to internal
    structures that support dynamic choice selection during player interactions. The
    method does not return any value but updates internal caches and lookup tables
    used by the game's interaction systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadPlayerChoices();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup as part
    of the general object manager initialization sequence. It performs database queries
    to fetch all player choice records and caches them in memory for fast access during
    gameplay. The method should only be called once during server lifetime, typically
    before any player interaction occurs.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate entries or
    memory leaks if not properly handled. It should never be invoked during active
    gameplay as it may cause race conditions or inconsistent data states. Ensure that
    the database tables contain valid data before calling this method.
