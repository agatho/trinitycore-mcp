  signature: time_t World::GetNextWeeklyQuestsResetTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Unix timestamp of the next weekly quests reset
    time.
  description: The GetNextWeeklyQuestsResetTime method determines the exact moment
    when weekly quest resets will occur in the game world. This is typically used
    to synchronize client UI elements, such as displaying countdown timers or updating
    quest status indicators. The method accounts for the server's configured reset
    time and returns a Unix timestamp representing that future point in time. It does
    not modify any internal state and can be called at any time to retrieve this information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp of the next weekly quests
    reset time. This value is always a future point in time relative to the current
    moment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'time_t nextReset = sWorld->GetNextWeeklyQuestsResetTime();

      std::cout << "Next weekly quest reset at: " << ctime(&nextReset);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a Countdown Timer
    code: "time_t nextReset = sWorld->GetNextWeeklyQuestsResetTime();\ntime_t now\
      \ = time(nullptr);\nif (nextReset > now) {\n    uint32 secondsLeft = static_cast<uint32>(nextReset\
      \ - now);\n    // Update UI with remaining seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the server's configured weekly reset time, which is
    typically set in the world configuration. The returned value is calculated based
    on the current system time and the configured reset schedule. This function is
    thread-safe as it only reads from immutable configuration data.
  warnings: Ensure that the server's time zone and reset time settings are correctly
    configured to avoid unexpected behavior. The method assumes that weekly resets
    occur at a fixed interval, which may not account for dynamic server events or
    maintenance windows.
