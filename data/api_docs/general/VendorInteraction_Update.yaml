documentation:
  brief: Updates the vendor interaction state based on the elapsed time since last
    update.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing the internal state of
    a vendor interaction within the TrinityCore framework. It processes timed events,
    handles item availability changes, and ensures that the vendor's inventory and
    transaction states are synchronized with the game world. This method is typically
    called by the core game loop at regular intervals to maintain up-to-date vendor
    behavior. The method uses the provided time delta (diff) to determine how much
    time has passed since the last update call, which is essential for implementing
    time-based vendor mechanics such as restocking items or resetting transaction
    states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'VendorInteraction* vendor = ...;

      vendor->Update(1000); // Update with 1 second elapsed time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly by the game's main update loop. The
    diff parameter represents milliseconds since last update, and accurate timing
    is crucial for proper vendor behavior. Implementation may involve checking item
    cooldowns, updating vendor inventory, and managing transaction timeouts.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with arbitrary time values; always pass
    the actual elapsed time since the last update to maintain game consistency. Improper
    use of the diff parameter can cause vendor items to appear/disappear incorrectly
    or transactions to timeout unexpectedly.
