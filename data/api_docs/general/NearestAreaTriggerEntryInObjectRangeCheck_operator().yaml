documentation:
  brief: Checks if an area trigger entry is within object range and returns true if
    found.
  description: The operator() method of NearestAreaTriggerEntryInObjectRangeCheck
    is a predicate function used to determine whether a given area trigger entry (represented
    by a pointer) falls within the specified object range. This check is typically
    employed in game logic to locate nearby area triggers for activation or interaction
    purposes. The method evaluates the distance between the current object and the
    area trigger, returning true if the trigger is within range, and false otherwise.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with container algorithms that search for elements
    matching certain criteria.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger entry pointed to by 'at' is within the
    defined object range; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Area Trigger Search
    code: "std::vector<int*> areaTriggers;\n// ... populate areaTriggers with valid\
      \ pointers ...\nNearestAreaTriggerEntryInObjectRangeCheck checker;\nauto it\
      \ = std::find_if(areaTriggers.begin(), areaTriggers.end(), checker);\nif (it\
      \ != areaTriggers.end()) {\n    // Found a trigger within range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a functor class designed for use with STL algorithms.
    The actual range checking logic depends on the implementation details of the parent
    class or context in which this functor is used. Performance can be affected by
    the number of area triggers being evaluated.
