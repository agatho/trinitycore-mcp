  class: NPCCraftingOrderInfo
  method: WriteUpdate
  signature: void NPCCraftingOrderInfo::WriteUpdate(ByteBuffer & data, bool ignoreChangesMask,
    const Player * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes NPC crafting order information into a ByteBuffer for network transmission
    to specified players.
  description: The WriteUpdate method serializes the current state of an NPCCraftingOrderInfo
    object into a ByteBuffer, which is typically used for sending updates to clients
    in World of Warcraft. This method handles the serialization process for crafting
    order data, including any relevant fields that need to be synchronized between
    the server and client. It takes into account whether changes masks should be ignored
    and uses provided player references to determine the correct update format and
    target recipients. The serialized data is intended for transmission over the network
    as part of the game's update system.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized crafting order information
      will be written. This buffer is typically used for constructing network packets.
  - name: ignoreChangesMask
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to ignore the changes mask when serializing
      data. If true, all fields are included regardless of their changed status; if
      false, only changed fields are serialized.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the crafting
      order. This may be used to determine access rights or specific serialization
      rules for the owner's view.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this update. The serialization
      may vary based on the receiver's perspective or permissions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Sending Crafting Order Update
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      NPCCraftingOrderInfo orderInfo;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get owner player

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get receiver player

      orderInfo.WriteUpdate(data, false, owner, receiver);

      // Send ''data'' to receiver via network layer'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during network update cycles when crafting
    order information needs to be synchronized with clients. The implementation likely
    uses internal field tracking to determine what has changed and applies appropriate
    serialization logic based on the provided parameters.
