  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::DiscoverFlightPaths()
documentation:
  brief: Discovers all available flight paths for the player character.
  description: The DiscoverFlightPaths method enables a player character to learn
    and gain access to all known flight paths within the game world. This method typically
    iterates through the player's current known flight master entries and marks them
    as discovered in the player's quest log or flight path database. It is commonly
    used during character initialization, quest completion, or when specific game
    events trigger flight path unlocks. The method does not require any parameters
    and modifies the internal state of the player's flight path discovery flags.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Behavior AI
    code: "void MyAI::OnPlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    // Discover all flight\
      \ paths for the entering player\n    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->DiscoverFlightPaths();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player login or quest completion
    events. It may affect performance if called frequently in rapid succession due
    to database updates and client packet sending.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper state checks can cause unnecessary
    database writes and client updates, potentially leading to performance degradation.
