  class: Aura
  method: GetCastId
  signature: int Aura::GetCastId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cast identifier associated with the aura instance.
  description: The GetCastId method returns the unique identifier (ID) that represents
    the casting source of the aura. This ID is typically used to track which spell
    or effect originally applied the aura, allowing for proper handling of aura interactions,
    stacking rules, and removal conditions. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, auras are often linked to specific casts of spells, and this identifier
    helps maintain consistency in spell mechanics such as proc tracking, aura duration
    management, and interaction with other auras from the same cast source.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the cast ID associated with the aura. This value
    uniquely identifies the casting instance that created the aura, typically corresponding
    to the spell's cast identifier in the game's internal systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    int castId = aura->GetCastId();\n\
      \    // Use castId to determine origin of the aura\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Aura Origin
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAuraBySpellId(12345);\nif (aura && aura->GetCastId()\
      \ == 67890)\n{\n    // Handle specific aura cast by a known spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned cast ID is usually set when the aura is applied and remains
    constant throughout the aura's lifetime. It can be used to distinguish between
    multiple instances of the same aura applied by different sources or casts.
  warnings: Ensure that the Aura pointer is valid before calling GetCastId, as dereferencing
    a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, note that cast IDs may
    not always be unique across all auras in the system, but they are unique within
    the context of a single aura instance.
