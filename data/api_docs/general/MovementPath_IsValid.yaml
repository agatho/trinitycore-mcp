  signature: bool MovementPath::IsValid() const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the movement path data is correctly initialized and contains
    valid waypoints.
  description: The IsValid method checks if a MovementPath object has been properly
    initialized with valid waypoint data. It verifies that the path contains at least
    one valid waypoint and that all internal data structures are in a consistent state.
    This method is typically used before executing or processing a movement path to
    ensure it can be safely used for creature or player movement calculations. The
    validation includes checking for null pointers, empty waypoint lists, and ensuring
    that each waypoint has valid coordinates and timing information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the movement path is valid and contains at least one waypoint
    with valid data; returns false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates
    that the path was not properly initialized or has been corrupted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Validation
    code: "MovementPath* path = new MovementPath();\nif (path->IsValid()) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with movement logic\n    path->Execute();\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid path\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid movement path detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Movement Handler
    code: "void HandleMovementUpdate(Player* player) {\n    if (player->GetMovementPath()\
      \ && player->GetMovementPath()->IsValid()) {\n        // Process valid movement\
      \ path\n        player->MoveToNextWaypoint();\n    } else {\n        // Reset\
      \ or clear invalid path\n        player->ClearMovementPath();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight validation check and should not be called
    excessively during high-frequency movement updates. The validation logic may vary
    depending on the specific implementation of MovementPath, but generally focuses
    on structural integrity rather than complex path optimization checks.
  warnings: Do not assume that a path marked as valid will remain valid throughout
    its lifetime. Movement paths can become invalid if modified externally or if waypoints
    are removed during execution. Always validate before using a path in critical
    movement logic.
