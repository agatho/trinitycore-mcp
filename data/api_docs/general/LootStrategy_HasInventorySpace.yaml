  class: LootStrategy
  method: HasInventorySpace
  signature: bool LootStrategy::HasInventorySpace(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot has sufficient inventory space to store loot items.
  description: The HasInventorySpace method determines whether a bot controlled by
    the AI system has enough free inventory slots to accommodate items that would
    be looted from a creature or object. This check is crucial for decision-making
    in loot strategies, ensuring that bots do not attempt to loot items when they
    cannot carry them. The method evaluates the current inventory state of the bot,
    including equipped items and bag space, and compares it against the potential
    loot to be acquired. It typically returns true if there is sufficient space available,
    and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for optimizing bot behavior
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot has enough inventory space to store any potential
    loot items; returns false if the inventory is full or nearly full.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Decision Logic
    code: "if (lootStrategy.HasInventorySpace(ai)) {\n    // Proceed with looting\n\
      \    ai->Loot();\n} else {\n    // Skip loot or manage inventory\n    ai->ManageInventory();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform multiple checks including bag space, item stack limits,
    and equipped item slots. It is recommended to call this method before initiating
    any loot operations to prevent errors or invalid actions.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for complex inventory management; consider
    additional checks such as item quality thresholds or specific item type restrictions
    based on bot role or strategy.
