  signature: uint32 GameObjectTemplate::GetNotInCombat() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the not-in-combat flag value for the game object template.
  description: The GetNotInCombat method retrieves the 'not in combat' flag setting
    from a GameObjectTemplate instance. This flag determines whether the game object
    should be considered as being in combat or not, which affects various game mechanics
    such as AI behavior, interaction restrictions, and quest progression. The returned
    value is typically used internally by the TrinityCore server to manage object
    states during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the not-in-combat flag setting. Typically 0
    means the object can be in combat, while a non-zero value indicates the object
    should remain out of combat state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      uint32 notInCombat = goTemplate->GetNotInCombat();\nif (notInCombat != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Object should remain out of combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObjectTemplate class which represents static
    data for game objects in the database. The returned value is loaded from the gameobject_template
    table's not_in_combat field during server startup or when templates are cached.
  warnings: The method does not perform any validation on the returned value, so developers
    should ensure proper handling of potential edge cases where the flag might be
    set to unexpected values.
