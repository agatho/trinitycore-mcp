  class: RogueAI
  method: RecordAbilityUsage
  signature: void RogueAI::RecordAbilityUsage(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Records the usage of a specified spell ability for the rogue AI.
  description: The RecordAbilityUsage method logs when a specific spell ability is
    used by the rogue AI. This functionality is typically employed to track ability
    cooldowns, manage resource allocation, and maintain accurate state information
    for AI decision-making processes. The method likely updates internal tracking
    structures or databases to reflect that the given spell has been executed, which
    may influence future AI behavior decisions such as when to use abilities again
    or how to prioritize actions based on recent usage patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell ability being recorded. This value
      corresponds to a specific rogue ability defined in the game's spell database,
      and must be a valid spell ID for the rogue class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a Rogue Ability Usage
    code: 'RogueAI* rogueAI = ...;

      uint32 stealthSpellId = 1784;

      rogueAI->RecordAbilityUsage(stealthSpellId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal AI state management system and
    may interact with cooldown tracking or ability priority systems. It's important
    to ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to a valid rogue ability to prevent
    unexpected behavior or errors in AI decision-making.
