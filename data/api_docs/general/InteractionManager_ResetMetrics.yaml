  signature: void InteractionManager::ResetMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all interaction metrics tracked by the InteractionManager to their
    initial state.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears and reinitializes all tracking data
    related to player interactions within the InteractionManager. This includes resetting
    counters, timers, and any accumulated statistics that monitor how players engage
    with game objects, NPCs, or other interactive elements. The method is typically
    invoked during system resets, server maintenance, or when transitioning between
    different game states where previous interaction data should not carry over. It
    ensures a clean slate for subsequent interaction tracking without affecting the
    core functionality of the manager.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InteractionManager* im = sObjectAccessor->GetInteractionManager();

      im->ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve resetting internal data structures and could potentially cause
    temporary overhead during execution. It's recommended to call this only when necessary,
    such as at server startup or after major game state changes.
  warnings: Calling ResetMetrics while active interactions are occurring might lead
    to inconsistent tracking data if not synchronized properly with ongoing interaction
    processes. Ensure that no other threads are actively modifying interaction metrics
    before invoking this method.
