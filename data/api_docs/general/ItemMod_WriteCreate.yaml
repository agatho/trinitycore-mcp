  class: ItemMod
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ItemMod::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Item * owner, const
    Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes item modification data to a ByteBuffer for client synchronization
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the current ItemMod object's data
    into a ByteBuffer format suitable for network transmission to clients. This method
    is typically used during item creation or modification events where client-side
    updates are required. The serialized data includes all relevant item modification
    properties that need to be synchronized between the server and the player's client.
    It takes into account both the owning item and the receiving player to ensure
    proper data formatting based on player-specific context such as visibility settings
    or access permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized item modification
      data will be written
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Item object that owns this modification, used to determine
      base properties and state
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this item modification
      data, used for context-specific formatting
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Item Creation
    code: 'ItemMod mod;

      Item* item = ...; // existing item

      Player* player = ...; // receiving player

      ByteBuffer dataBuffer;

      mod.WriteCreate(dataBuffer, item, player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Network Packet Construction
    code: "void SendItemModificationPacket(Player* player, Item* item, ItemMod& mod)\
      \ {\n    ByteBuffer data;\n    mod.WriteCreate(data, item, player);\n    WorldPacket\
      \ packet(SMSG_ITEM_UPDATE, data.size());\n    packet.append(data);\n    player->SendDirectMessage(&packet);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's object serialization system and
    should only be called when item modifications need to be sent to clients. The
    method assumes that all parameters are valid pointers and does not perform null
    checks. It's commonly used in conjunction with other serialization methods like
    WriteUpdate or WriteDestroy for complete object lifecycle management.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that the owner Item and receiver
    Player objects are properly initialized, as it may lead to undefined behavior.
    The ByteBuffer should be large enough to accommodate all serialized data; otherwise,
    buffer overflow may occur. This method is typically called internally by the core
    system during item state changes.
