  brief: Updates all active buffs and debuffs for the Unholy Death Knight
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buff and debuff effects on the Unholy Death Knight class. This includes
    checking the duration of existing auras, applying new buffs based on the player's
    current state, and removing expired effects. The method typically runs during
    each AI update cycle to ensure that the death knight's combat effectiveness is
    accurately represented. It handles both player-specific buffs such as rune regeneration
    and damage increases, as well as debuffs that may affect the target. This method
    is crucial for maintaining proper gameplay balance and ensuring that class mechanics
    function correctly.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void UnholyDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic ...\n    m_unholyDK->UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to maintain
    accurate buff/debuff states. It may internally iterate through all active auras
    and perform checks on their durations. The implementation likely involves checking
    for aura expiration, applying new effects based on current spell states, and managing
    cooldowns or resource costs associated with buff application.
