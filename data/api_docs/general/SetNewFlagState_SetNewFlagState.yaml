  class: SetNewFlagState
  method: SetNewFlagState
  signature: void SetNewFlagState::SetNewFlagState(FlagState state, int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the new flag state for a player in the game world.
  description: The SetNewFlagState method updates the flag state of a specified player
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used in game mechanics
    involving player flags, such as PvP status, movement states, or other conditional
    gameplay elements. The method modifies internal player data structures to reflect
    the new flag state provided as input. It's commonly invoked during event handling,
    state transitions, or when processing player actions that affect their gameplay
    flags.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: The FlagState enum value representing the new state to be set for
      the player. This typically defines a specific gameplay condition or status flag.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index
      within the game world. This parameter specifies which player's flag state will
      be modified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player's Flag State
    code: 'FlagState newState = FLAG_STATE_PVP;

      int playerId = 12345;

      SetNewFlagState(newState, &playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player state management systems
    and may trigger additional events or updates depending on the flag being set.
    Developers should ensure that the FlagState values passed are valid according
    to the game's defined enum constants.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to inconsistent player states or
    unexpected behavior in gameplay mechanics. Ensure that all flag state transitions
    follow the expected sequence and that the player identifier is valid before calling
    this method.
