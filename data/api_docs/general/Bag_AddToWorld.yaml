documentation:
  brief: Adds the bag object to the game world environment, making it visible and
    interactable to players.
  description: The AddToWorld method is responsible for integrating a Bag object into
    the active game world. This method ensures that the bag becomes part of the world's
    object management system, allowing it to be discovered, accessed, and manipulated
    by players and other game systems. It typically handles internal registration
    with the world manager, updates spatial positioning data, and may trigger related
    events or notifications. The method is commonly called during object creation
    or when a bag needs to be made available in a player's inventory or in the world.
    This method should only be invoked on properly initialized Bag objects that have
    valid data and are ready to be integrated into the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Bag* bag = new Bag();

      bag->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should not be called on bags that are already in the world, as
    it may cause duplicate registrations or memory issues. Ensure the bag has been
    properly initialized with valid GUID and position data before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling AddToWorld on an uninitialized or invalid Bag object can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the bag is fully constructed
    and configured before invoking this method.
