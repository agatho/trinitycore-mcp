documentation:
  brief: Sends a Game Master text message to all online players using a predefined
    string identifier.
  description: The SendGMText method broadcasts a localized Game Master message to
    every player currently connected to the server. It uses a string identifier to
    retrieve the appropriate localized text from the database, ensuring that messages
    are displayed in the correct language for each player. This function is typically
    used by GMs or administrative scripts to communicate important information, announcements,
    or warnings to all players. The method does not require any specific parameters
    beyond the string ID, which should correspond to a valid entry in the game's localization
    tables.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast GM Announcement
    code: World::SendGMText(12345); // Sends message with ID 12345 to all online players
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates synchronously and sends messages immediately to all
    connected clients. It relies on the server's localization system, so string_id
    must exist in the database or the message will not be displayed correctly. The
    implementation may involve a broadcast loop over all active sessions.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided string_id is valid and exists in the localization
    tables; otherwise, no message will be sent to players. Avoid using this method
    excessively as it can cause network overhead and client-side performance issues
    with too many simultaneous broadcasts.
