  class: QuestPickup
  method: ProcessQuestPickupQueue
  signature: void QuestPickup::ProcessQuestPickupQueue(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the quest pickup queue for a specified player bot.
  description: The ProcessQuestPickupQueue method handles the logic for processing
    queued quest pickups assigned to a player bot. This typically involves iterating
    through pending quest-related actions, such as accepting quests, turning in quests,
    or completing objectives, and executing them in the appropriate order. The method
    ensures that quest progression is handled correctly within the context of automated
    gameplay behavior, particularly in AI-driven scenarios like botting or automated
    quest completion systems. It may also manage quest state transitions and update
    the player's quest log accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest pickup
      queue will be processed. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      QuestPickup::ProcessQuestPickupQueue(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during AI decision-making cycles or periodic
    updates in automated questing systems. It assumes that the provided player object
    has valid quest data and that all necessary game state checks have been performed
    before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer for 'bot' will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the player object is properly initialized and in a valid
    state before invoking this function.
