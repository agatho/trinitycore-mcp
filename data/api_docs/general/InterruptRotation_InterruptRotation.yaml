documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the current rotation process for an AI-controlled unit
  description: The InterruptRotation method stops any ongoing rotation sequence that
    is currently being executed by an AI-controlled unit. This method is typically
    used when a unit needs to cease its current action or behavior, such as when it
    is interrupted by damage, fear, or other external factors. The method ensures
    that the rotation state is properly reset and that the unit can respond to new
    commands or events. It is commonly called during combat situations where the AI
    must abandon its current rotation to handle incoming threats or changes in target
    priority.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Rotation Usage
    code: "void OnDamageTaken(Unit* attacker, uint32 damage)\n{\n    // Interrupt\
      \ current rotation when taking damage\n    me->GetAI()->InterruptRotation();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on AI-controlled units. It resets the internal
    rotation state machine, which may cause unexpected behavior if not used properly
    in conjunction with other AI methods. The method is typically non-blocking and
    returns immediately.
  warnings: Calling this method during critical AI states or while other rotation-related
    operations are in progress might lead to inconsistent behavior. Ensure that the
    unit's current state allows for interruption before calling this method.
