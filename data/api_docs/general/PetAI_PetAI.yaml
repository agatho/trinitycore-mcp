  class: PetAI
  method: PetAI
  signature: void PetAI::PetAI(Creature * creature, int scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PetAI instance for a creature with the specified script ID.
  description: The PetAI constructor initializes the artificial intelligence behavior
    for a creature that acts as a pet in World of Warcraft. This method sets up the
    internal state of the PetAI class, linking it to a specific creature object and
    assigning it a script identifier. The script ID is used to determine which AI
    behaviors and actions should be executed by the pet. This initialization is crucial
    for enabling proper pet AI functionality including following the owner, attacking
    targets, and executing pet-specific commands. The method typically gets called
    during the creation or spawning of a pet creature within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that represents the pet. This parameter
      must be a valid pointer to an existing creature instance, typically representing
      a summoned or owned pet in the game world.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Integer identifier used to select the appropriate AI script behavior
      for this pet. The script ID determines how the pet will act, including combat
      behavior, movement patterns, and special abilities. Valid values are typically
      defined by the game's AI script system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PetAI Initialization
    code: 'Creature* pet = ...; // A valid pet creature

      int scriptId = 12345;

      PetAI* petAI = new PetAI(pet, scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing PetAI with Owner Reference
    code: "Player* owner = ...; // Player who owns the pet\nCreature* pet = owner->GetPet();\n\
      if (pet)\n{\n    PetAI* petAI = new PetAI(pet, 54321);\n    // Configure additional\
      \ pet AI settings here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a pet creature is created. Developers should not normally instantiate PetAI
    directly unless implementing custom pet AI behavior. The creature parameter must
    be a valid, non-null pointer to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the creature parameter will likely cause a
    crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the creature object is fully initialized
    and valid before calling this constructor. The scriptId should correspond to an
    existing AI script in the game's database to ensure proper pet behavior.
