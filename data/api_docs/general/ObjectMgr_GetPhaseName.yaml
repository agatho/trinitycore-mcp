  method: GetPhaseName
  signature: std::string ObjectMgr::GetPhaseName(uint32 phaseId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name of a phase given its unique identifier.
  description: The GetPhaseName method retrieves the human-readable name associated
    with a specific phase ID within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality
    is commonly used in game mechanics that involve phased content, such as world
    events, instance phases, or dynamic environment changes. The method performs a
    lookup in the internal phase data structure and returns the corresponding phase
    name string. It is typically called when displaying phase information to players
    or when processing phase-related game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the name of the phase associated with the given
    phase ID. If no phase exists for the provided ID, an empty string may be returned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 phaseId = 1234;\nstd::string phaseName = sObjectMgr->GetPhaseName(phaseId);\n\
      if (!phaseName.empty())\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"server.loading\", \"Current phase:\
      \ %s\", phaseName.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Phase Name Display in Chat
    code: "void DisplayPhaseInfo(Player* player, uint32 phaseId)\n{\n    std::string\
      \ phaseName = sObjectMgr->GetPhaseName(phaseId);\n    if (phaseName.empty())\n\
      \        player->SendNotification(\"Unknown phase ID: %u\", phaseId);\n    else\n\
      \        player->SendNotification(\"Current phase: %s\", phaseName.c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal phase data structures that are typically populated
    during server startup or when loading phase definitions from database. The implementation
    assumes that phase IDs are valid and correspond to registered phases in the system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent phase ID may return
    an empty string, which should be handled appropriately by calling code to avoid
    unexpected behavior.
