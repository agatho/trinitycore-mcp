  class: EssenceResource
  method: Regenerate
  signature: void EssenceResource::Regenerate(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the essence resource's current value based on the elapsed time since
    last update.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for incrementally restoring the
    EssenceResource's current value over time. It takes a time delta (in milliseconds)
    and applies regeneration logic to increase the resource's amount, typically following
    a defined rate or interval. This method is commonly called by the game loop or
    resource management systems to ensure resources naturally recover. The regeneration
    process may be subject to limits such as maximum capacity, cooldowns, or specific
    conditions that prevent regeneration under certain circumstances.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'EssenceResource resource;

      uint32 deltaTime = 1000; // 1 second

      resource.Regenerate(deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdateEssenceResources(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& player : players)\n\
      \    {\n        if (player->HasEssenceResource())\n        {\n            player->GetEssenceResource()->Regenerate(diff);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the game's main update loop or resource
    tick handler. It should be called regularly to maintain accurate resource state.
    The regeneration behavior might depend on player state, buffs, or environmental
    factors in TrinityCore's implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called with invalid time deltas (e.g.,
    negative values) as it could lead to unexpected behavior or resource depletion.
    Also, avoid calling Regenerate too frequently without proper time delta handling
    to prevent performance issues.
