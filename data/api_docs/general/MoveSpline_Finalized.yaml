  class: MoveSpline
  method: Finalized
  signature: bool MoveSpline::Finalized() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the movement spline has completed its execution and is
    no longer active.
  description: The Finalized method checks if a MoveSpline object has finished processing
    its movement path. This typically occurs after the spline has been fully executed,
    either naturally or due to interruption. The method returns true when the spline
    is in a finalized state, indicating that it can no longer be modified or resumed.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this is used to manage character
    and creature movement states, ensuring proper cleanup and state transitions after
    path completion. This check is essential for preventing operations on stale or
    completed splines.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the MoveSpline has completed execution and is finalized;
    otherwise returns false if the spline is still active or pending completion.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a spline is finalized before proceeding
    code: "if (spline->Finalized()) {\n    // Spline has completed, safe to clean\
      \ up or start new movement\n    player->SetCanMove(true);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Spline still active, continue monitoring\n    player->SetCanMove(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Finalized in a movement completion callback
    code: "void OnMovementFinished(MoveSpline* spline) {\n    if (spline->Finalized())\
      \ {\n        // Movement is complete, trigger next action\n        HandlePathCompletion();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement state management
    systems. It's important to note that a finalized spline should not be modified
    or resumed, as doing so may lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. The
    method itself is lightweight and does not perform any expensive operations.
  warnings: Do not attempt to resume or modify a spline after calling Finalized()
    and receiving a true result. This can cause invalid memory access or inconsistent
    movement states in the game world.
