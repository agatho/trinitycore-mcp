  class: RestStrategy

  signature: Item * RestStrategy::FindDrink(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a drink item from the bot's inventory for consumption during
    rest.
  description: The FindDrink method searches through the bot's inventory to locate
    a suitable drinkable item that can be consumed while resting. This method is typically
    used by AI strategies to ensure the bot has access to beverages when healing or
    regenerating mana. It evaluates items based on their consumable properties and
    availability within the bot's inventory. The method does not modify the inventory
    state but returns a pointer to an appropriate drink item if one exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an Item object representing a drinkable item found in the
    bot's inventory, or nullptr if no suitable drink is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindDrink
    code: "Item* drink = ai->GetBot()->GetRestStrategy()->FindDrink(ai);\nif (drink)\n\
      {\n    // Use the drink item\n    ai->UseItem(drink);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the RestStrategy class and is typically called during
    bot rest behavior to determine if a consumable drink is available. The implementation
    likely checks for items with specific consumable flags or item classes that represent
    beverages.
