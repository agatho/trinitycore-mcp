  brief: Performs cleanup and shutdown operations for the gathering manager system
  description: The OnShutdown method is called during server shutdown to gracefully
    terminate all active gathering operations and release associated resources. This
    method ensures that any ongoing mining, herbalism, or other resource gathering
    activities are properly concluded before the server closes. It typically handles
    cleanup of internal data structures, notifies relevant subsystems, and ensures
    no dangling references remain in memory. The method is invoked automatically by
    the TrinityCore framework during server shutdown sequence and should not be called
    manually under normal circumstances.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically invoked by the TrinityCore server framework
    during shutdown. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom shutdown logic. The method may block briefly while cleaning up active gathering
    operations.
