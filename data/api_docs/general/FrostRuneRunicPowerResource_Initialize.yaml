  method: Initialize
  signature: void FrostRuneRunicPowerResource::Initialize(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the frost rune runic power resource for a player bot.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the frost rune runic power resource state
    for a given player bot. This typically involves configuring internal data structures,
    resetting resource values, and preparing the resource for use in combat or other
    game mechanics. The method ensures that the player's frost rune resource is properly
    initialized with default values and ready to be consumed or modified during gameplay.
    It may also perform necessary setup for tracking rune regeneration or cooldowns
    specific to frost runes.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will use the
      frost rune runic power resource. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'FrostRuneRunicPowerResource resource;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      resource.Initialize(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance during initialization.
    It is typically invoked when a bot is created or when the frost rune resource
    system is first activated for that player.
