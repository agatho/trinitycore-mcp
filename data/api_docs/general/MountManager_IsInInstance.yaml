  class: MountManager
  method: IsInInstance
  signature: bool MountManager::IsInInstance(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is currently inside an instance zone.
  description: The IsInInstance method checks if the specified player is located within
    an instance zone, such as a dungeon, raid, or battleground. This method is commonly
    used to enforce restrictions or behaviors that should only apply in instanced
    environments. It evaluates the player's current map and zone context to determine
    if they are in a non-world area. The method returns true if the player is inside
    an instance, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object to check. This parameter must not be
      null for valid results.
  returns: Returns true if the player is in an instance zone (dungeon, raid, battleground,
    etc.), false if the player is in a regular world area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if player is in instance
    code: "if (mountManager.IsInInstance(player)) {\n    // Player is in an instance\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"You are inside an instance.\");\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ is in the world\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You are in the open world.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal TrinityCore zone and map tracking systems.
    It may not account for temporary or custom instance types unless properly configured
    within the core. The player pointer must be valid to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null, as passing
    an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior. This method does not differentiate
    between different types of instances (e.g., dungeon vs raid), it only checks if
    the player is in any instance zone.
