  class: OutdoorPvPMgr
  method: AddZone
  signature: void OutdoorPvPMgr::AddZone(int zoneid, OutdoorPvP * handle)
documentation:
  brief: Registers an OutdoorPvP handle for a specific zone ID within the OutdoorPvP
    management system.
  description: The AddZone method associates a given OutdoorPvP instance with a specific
    zone identifier, enabling the system to manage and update the outdoor PvP state
    for that zone. This registration is essential for the proper functioning of outdoor
    PvP zones in TrinityCore, as it allows the core game logic to route events and
    updates to the correct OutdoorPvP handler. The method typically gets called during
    server initialization or when a new outdoor PvP zone is added to the game world.
    It ensures that zone-specific events such as capture, territory changes, and player
    interactions are properly handled by the designated OutdoorPvP implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneid
    description: The unique identifier of the zone to register for outdoor PvP handling.
      This value corresponds to the zone ID used internally by TrinityCore's map and
      zone systems.
  - name: handle
    description: Pointer to an OutdoorPvP instance that will manage all outdoor PvP
      activities for the specified zone. This handle must be a valid, initialized
      OutdoorPvP object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Zone Registration
    code: 'OutdoorPvPMgr* mgr = OutdoorPvPMgr::Instance();

      OutdoorPvP* pvpHandle = new OutdoorPvPZoneExample();

      mgr->AddZone(1234, pvpHandle);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Zones
    code: 'OutdoorPvPMgr* mgr = OutdoorPvPMgr::Instance();

      OutdoorPvP* handle1 = new OutdoorPvPZoneExample1();

      OutdoorPvP* handle2 = new OutdoorPvPZoneExample2();

      mgr->AddZone(1001, handle1);

      mgr->AddZone(1002, handle2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the zone ID or handle parameters.
    It is assumed that the caller has verified these values are valid before calling
    AddZone. The OutdoorPvPMgr maintains an internal registry of zones and their associated
    handlers, which is used during zone updates and event processing.
  warnings: Calling AddZone with a duplicate zone ID may overwrite existing OutdoorPvP
    handles, potentially causing unexpected behavior or loss of functionality in previously
    registered zones. Ensure that each zone ID maps to only one OutdoorPvP instance
    unless intentional overwriting is intended.
