  class: MetricStatistics
  method: Update
  signature: void MetricStatistics::Update(uint64_t value)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the metric statistics with a new value
  description: The Update method in the MetricStatistics class is used to record and
    process a new numerical value within the statistics tracking system. This method
    typically accumulates or aggregates values over time, maintaining internal state
    for metrics such as performance measurements, resource usage, or game event counts.
    It is commonly used in TrinityCore's monitoring and profiling systems to gather
    data about server performance, player activity, or other measurable aspects of
    the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: value
    description: The numerical value to be added to the metric statistics. This is
      typically a uint64_t representing time durations, counts, or other measurable
      quantities relevant to the tracked metrics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a performance metric
    code: 'MetricStatistics stats;

      uint64_t executionTime = 1500; // microseconds

      stats.Update(executionTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating multiple metrics in a loop
    code: "MetricStatistics packetStats;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i)\n{\n    uint64_t\
      \ size = GetPacketSize();\n    packetStats.Update(size);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe and designed for high-frequency updates.
    The internal implementation may use atomic operations or locking mechanisms to
    ensure data consistency when multiple threads update the same statistics object
    concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the value parameter represents meaningful data relevant to
    the metric being tracked, as invalid values could skew statistical analysis results.
    Avoid calling this method with extremely large values that might cause overflow
    in internal calculations.
