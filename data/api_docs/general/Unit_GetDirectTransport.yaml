  method: GetDirectTransport
  signature: TransportBase * Unit::GetDirectTransport() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the transport object directly associated with this unit.
  description: This method retrieves the TransportBase object that is directly linked
    to the Unit instance, typically representing a transport vehicle such as a boat
    or flight path. The returned transport object may be nullptr if no direct transport
    is assigned to the unit. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to access transport-related data for units that are currently on transports,
    particularly when handling movement and positioning within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the TransportBase object associated with this unit,
    or nullptr if no direct transport is assigned. The returned transport may be null
    in cases where the unit is not currently on a transport or when the transport
    has been removed from the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "TransportBase* transport = unit->GetDirectTransport();\nif (transport)\n\
      {\n    // Do something with the transport\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement handling logic
    and may be called during update cycles or when processing unit movement. It is
    important to note that the returned transport object might not always be valid,
    especially if the unit has been removed from a transport or if the transport has
    been destroyed.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it can return nullptr in
    cases where units are not currently on transports. Additionally, accessing transport
    objects directly may lead to potential issues if the transport is no longer valid
    or has been removed from memory.
