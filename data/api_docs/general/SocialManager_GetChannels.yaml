  signature: int SocialManager::GetChannels() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of social channels the player is currently subscribed
    to
  description: The GetChannels method returns an integer value representing the total
    count of chat channels that the player character is currently joined to. This
    includes both general channels like 'General' and 'Trade', as well as private
    channels such as guild channels, officer channels, and custom created channels.
    The method provides a quick way to determine channel membership status without
    having to iterate through individual channel lists. This functionality is primarily
    used in the social system of TrinityCore to manage player communication and channel
    subscriptions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of chat channels the player is
    currently subscribed to. Returns 0 if the player is not subscribed to any channels.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int channelCount = player->GetSocial()->GetChannels();\nif (channelCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Player is subscribed to %d channels\\n\", channelCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Channel Management Check
    code: "SocialManager* social = player->GetSocial();\nint currentChannels = social->GetChannels();\n\
      if (currentChannels >= MAX_CHANNELS)\n{\n    printf(\"Warning: Player has reached\
      \ maximum channel limit\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other social system functions
    to manage player communication. The returned value represents active channel subscriptions
    and may be affected by server configuration limits on maximum channels per player.
    Implementation likely involves iterating through internal channel subscription
    lists maintained by the SocialManager.
  warnings: The return value should not be used as a direct indicator of whether a
    player can join additional channels, as there might be server-side limitations
    or restrictions that are not reflected in this count. This method may not account
    for temporary channel states or pending joins.
