documentation:
  brief: Captures and returns a snapshot of current bot performance metrics
  description: The GetSnapshot method retrieves a comprehensive set of performance
    metrics from the bot performance monitoring system. This method provides real-time
    data about bot resource utilization, processing times, and system load that can
    be used for debugging, optimization, and monitoring purposes. The returned PerformanceMetrics
    object contains detailed information about CPU usage, memory consumption, tick
    rates, and other relevant performance indicators. This method is typically called
    by administrators or monitoring tools to assess the health and efficiency of bot
    operations within the TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PerformanceMetrics object containing current snapshot data including
    CPU usage percentages, memory consumption values, tick processing times, and system
    load statistics that represent the state of bot performance at the moment the
    method was called.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceMetrics metrics = botMonitor->GetSnapshot();

      std::cout << "CPU Usage: " << metrics.cpuUsage << "%" << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Memory Usage: " << metrics.memoryUsage << " MB" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Loop
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    PerformanceMetrics snapshot = botMonitor->GetSnapshot();\n\
      \    if (snapshot.cpuUsage > 80.0f)\n    {\n        LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"High\
      \ CPU usage detected: {}%\", snapshot.cpuUsage);\n    }\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned PerformanceMetrics object is a snapshot at the time of invocation and
    may not reflect real-time values if called in rapid succession. The performance
    metrics are collected using system-level APIs and may include overhead from monitoring
    itself.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently in tight loops may introduce performance
    overhead due to system calls required for metric collection. The returned data
    should be treated as instantaneous snapshots and not used for long-term trend
    analysis without proper sampling intervals.
