documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest completion state based on elapsed time
  description: The QuestCompletion::Update method is responsible for processing and
    maintaining the state of quest completions within the game world. It handles time-based
    updates for active quests, such as checking if time limits have expired, updating
    quest progress, or triggering quest completion events. This method is typically
    called from the main game loop at regular intervals to ensure that quest states
    are properly synchronized with the passage of in-game time. The method accepts
    a time delta parameter that represents the milliseconds elapsed since the last
    update call.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to determine how much time has passed and affects quest timers,
      progress checks, and completion conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\n\
      \    questCompletion.Update(diff);\n    // ... other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Conditional Logic
    code: "void Player::UpdateQuests(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (HasActiveQuests())\n\
      \    {\n        questCompletion.Update(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game update loop. The
    'diff' parameter must be a positive integer representing milliseconds. Performance
    considerations include minimizing expensive operations within this method to avoid
    frame rate drops. This method is not thread-safe and should only be called from
    the main game thread.
  warnings: Do not call this method with negative or zero values for 'diff', as it
    may cause unexpected behavior in quest timers. Avoid performing heavy computations
    inside this method that could block the main game loop.
