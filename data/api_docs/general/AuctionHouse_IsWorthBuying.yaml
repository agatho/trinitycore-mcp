documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an auction item is worth purchasing based on player and
    auction data
  description: The IsWorthBuying method evaluates if a given auction item should be
    purchased by a specific player. It considers factors such as the item's current
    bid, the player's valuation of the item, and potential profit margins. This method
    is typically used within the auction house system to help players make informed
    decisions about which items to bid on or buy outright. The method requires access
    to both the player's data and the auction item details to perform its evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that is evaluating whether to purchase
      the auction item. This parameter represents the player's data including their
      inventory, money, and valuation preferences.
  - name: auction
    description: Reference to the AuctionItem structure containing details about the
      item being auctioned. This includes bid information, item properties, and auction
      parameters that influence the purchasing decision.
  returns: Returns true if the auction item is considered worth purchasing by the
    specified player, based on internal evaluation logic; otherwise returns false.
    The decision may be influenced by factors such as item value, current bid amount,
    and player's financial status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if an auction item is worth buying
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nAuctionItem auctionItem = ...;\nbool shouldBuy =\
      \ AuctionHouse::IsWorthBuying(player, auctionItem);\nif (shouldBuy) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with purchasing the item\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsWorthBuying in a bidding strategy implementation
    code: "void EvaluateAuctionBid(Player* player, AuctionItem& auction) {\n    if\
      \ (AuctionHouse::IsWorthBuying(player, auction)) {\n        // Place bid or\
      \ buyout\n        if (auction.GetBid() < auction.GetBuyout()) {\n          \
      \  // Place a bid\n        } else {\n            // Buyout the item\n      \
      \  }\n    } else {\n        // Skip this auction\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex calculations involving item valuation,
    market analysis, and player-specific preferences. It may cache certain values
    for performance optimization. The exact algorithm used for determining 'worthiness'
    is not publicly documented but would typically involve comparing the item's value
    against its current bid or buyout price.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters and may crash or produce undefined
    behavior if either player or auction references are null. Developers should ensure
    proper validation before calling this method in production code.
