  class: QuestCompletion
  method: IsObjectiveComplete
  signature: bool QuestCompletion::IsObjectiveComplete(const QuestObjectiveData &
    objective)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified quest objective has been completed by the
    player.
  description: The IsObjectiveComplete method checks if a given quest objective, represented
    by a QuestObjectiveData structure, has been fully completed by the player. This
    method is typically used during quest progression to evaluate whether specific
    conditions or requirements have been met. It evaluates the current state of the
    objective against the player's progress and returns true if all requirements are
    satisfied, otherwise false. The method plays a critical role in determining quest
    completion status and advancing quest states within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: objective
    description: A constant reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure that defines
      the specific quest objective to be checked for completion.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest objective has been completed by the
    player, false otherwise. This indicates whether all conditions or requirements
    defined in the objective have been satisfied.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a quest objective is complete
    code: "QuestObjectiveData objective;\n// ... populate objective with data ...\n\
      if (questCompletion.IsObjectiveComplete(objective)) {\n    // Objective is complete,\
      \ proceed with quest advancement\n    player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest tracking systems and may
    perform checks against player data such as item counts, kill counts, or location
    requirements. It should be called during appropriate quest update cycles to ensure
    accurate state evaluation.
  warnings: Ensure that the QuestObjectiveData parameter is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid or uninitialized data could lead to unexpected
    behavior or incorrect completion status evaluation.
