  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void FarmingCoordinator::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the farming coordinator system, setting up internal data structures
    and registering necessary callbacks for crop management.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the FarmingCoordinator class for operation
    by establishing required internal state, loading configuration settings, and registering
    event handlers for crop growth, harvesting, and player interactions. This method
    must be called before any other farming operations can be performed. It typically
    initializes data structures such as crop maps, player farming records, and system
    timers. The initialization process may also involve validating existing farm data,
    creating necessary database entries, or setting up communication channels with
    other subsystems like the player manager or world state handler.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server startup or when
    a new farming system instance is created. Reinitialization may lead to data corruption
    or unexpected behavior. The method performs blocking operations during initialization,
    so it's recommended to call it during server loading phases rather than runtime.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    memory leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure all previous farming data
    is properly saved before reinitializing the coordinator.
