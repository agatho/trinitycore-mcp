documentation:
  brief: Removes all auras that are associated with shape shift forms from the unit.
  description: This method removes all auras that are linked to shape shift forms,
    such as cat form, bear form, and other similar transformations. It is typically
    used in conjunction with the RemoveAurasByType method to clear specific aura types.
    The function operates on the unit's aura list and will remove any aura that has
    a shape shift type associated with it, ensuring no lingering effects from previous
    shape shift states. This method is commonly used during player or creature transformations
    to ensure clean state transitions.

    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method typically operates on the aura list
    of the unit, removing all auras that have shape shift type associated with them.
    Performance considerations: No significant performance impact since it only removes
    auras from a specific category. Thread safety: Not thread-safe; requires synchronization
    if used in multi-threaded environments.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Not checking whether the unit has any shape shift auras
    before calling this method can lead to unnecessary processing. Dangerous edge
    cases: If called on a unit that does not have any shape shift auras, it may result
    in empty aura lists being processed.'
