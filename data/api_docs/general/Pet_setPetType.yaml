documentation:
  brief: Sets the pet type for this pet instance, determining its behavior and abilities
    within the game.
  description: The setPetType method configures the type of pet this object represents.
    In TrinityCore's World of Warcraft implementation, pet types define core behaviors
    such as whether the pet is a summoned creature, a companion, or has specific AI
    characteristics. This method directly affects how the pet interacts with the game
    world and its owner. The change takes immediate effect on the pet's properties
    and may influence combat behavior, spell casting, and other gameplay mechanics.
    This method should be called before the pet is fully initialized or when transitioning
    between different pet states during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The PetType enum value specifying the category of pet behavior to
      assign. Valid values include PET_TYPE_SUMMON, PET_TYPE_GUARDIAN, PET_TYPE_PET,
      and others defined in the PetType enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Summon Pet Type
    code: 'Pet* myPet = ...;

      myPet->setPetType(PET_TYPE_SUMMON);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring a Guardian Pet
    code: 'Pet* battlePet = ...;

      battlePet->setPetType(PET_TYPE_GUARDIAN);

      // This will make the pet act as a defensive companion'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal pet state flags that affect AI decision making
    and gameplay behavior. It's recommended to call this method early in the pet's
    lifecycle, ideally during initialization or when transitioning between pet states.
    The method does not trigger any visual updates or network packets directly; these
    are handled separately by the core systems.
  warnings: Calling setPetType on a pet that is already in combat or actively engaged
    may cause unexpected behavior. Ensure the pet is in a stable state before changing
    its type. Also, some pet types may require additional setup steps beyond just
    calling this method to function correctly.
