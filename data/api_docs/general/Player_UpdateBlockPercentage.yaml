documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's block chance percentage based on their defensive attributes
    and equipment.
  description: The UpdateBlockPercentage method recalculates and sets the player's
    chance to successfully block incoming attacks using a shield or other blocking
    mechanisms. This method is typically invoked when the player's equipment changes,
    stats are modified, or when the block chance needs to be refreshed during combat.
    The calculation considers factors such as the player's defense skill, shield rating,
    and any applicable buffs or debuffs that affect blocking ability. It ensures that
    the player's block percentage accurately reflects their current combat readiness.

  - title: Trigger block percentage update during combat state change
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      // When player''s defensive stats change during combat

      player->UpdateBlockPercentage();

      // Ensures accurate blocking chance for next block attempt'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally updates the player's block chance value stored in
    their combat statistics. It should be called whenever there is a change to the
    player's defensive capabilities that affects their ability to block incoming attacks.
