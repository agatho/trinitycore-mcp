api:
  class: InteractionManager
  method: BidOnAuction
  signature: bool InteractionManager::BidOnAuction(Player * bot, Creature * auctioneer,
    uint32 auctionId, uint32 bid)
documentation:
  brief: Places a bid on a specified auction item through the auctioneer NPC.
  description: The BidOnAuction method allows a player character to place a bid on
    an existing auction item. It interacts with the auction system by sending a bid
    request to the auctioneer NPC, using the provided auction ID and bid amount. The
    method validates that the bid meets minimum requirements and that the player has
    sufficient funds before processing the transaction. If successful, the bid is
    recorded in the auction database and the player's gold is deducted accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character placing the
      bid.
  - name: auctioneer
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the auctioneer NPC handling
      the auction.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific auction item being bid upon.
  - name: bid
    description: The amount of gold the player wishes to bid on the auction item.
  returns: Returns true if the bid was successfully placed and processed, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate insufficient funds, invalid auction ID, or
    other auction system errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bid Placement
    code: "if (interactionManager.BidOnAuction(player, auctioneer, 12345, 100000))\
      \ {\n    // Bid accepted\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"\
      Bid placed successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Bid failed\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"\
      Failed to place bid.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Bid Based on Item Value
    code: "uint32 maxBid = itemTemplate->BuyPrice * 2; // Set maximum bid as twice\
      \ the item's buy price\nif (bidAmount <= maxBid && interactionManager.BidOnAuction(player,\
      \ auctioneer, auctionId, bidAmount)) {\n    // Proceed with successful bid\n\
      \    player->ModifyMoney(-static_cast<int32>(bidAmount));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is within interaction range
    of the auctioneer NPC. The method does not validate whether the bid meets the
    minimum increment required by the auction system; this validation is handled internally
    by the auction house system.
  warnings: Ensure that the player has sufficient gold before calling this method,
    as failure to do so may result in silent failures or error messages. Also, be
    aware that placing a bid on an item you own will not work unless it's a bid placed
    by another player for your own item.
