  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetTimeToTarget
  signature: uint32 AreaTrigger::GetTimeToTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time in milliseconds remaining for an area trigger
    to reach its target position.
  description: The GetTimeToTarget method computes the remaining duration, in milliseconds,
    until an area trigger reaches its designated target location. This is typically
    used in conjunction with movement-based area triggers that have a defined travel
    time from their spawn point to a destination. The returned value represents how
    much time is left before the trigger completes its movement path and potentially
    expires or activates associated effects. This method is essential for managing
    timed area trigger behavior, such as those used in raid encounters, quest events,
    or environmental effects where precise timing is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time in milliseconds remaining until the
    area trigger reaches its target position. Returns 0 if the trigger has already
    reached its destination or if no valid target exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Trigger Progress
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    uint32 timeLeft = trigger->GetTimeToTarget();\n    if (timeLeft > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // Trigger is still moving\n        sLog->outString(\"Area trigger\
      \ will reach target in %u ms\", timeLeft);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n       \
      \ // Trigger has reached its target\n        sLog->outString(\"Area trigger\
      \ has reached target\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal timing mechanism of area triggers and
    assumes that the trigger's movement path and duration are properly initialized.
    The returned value may be affected by server tick rate and potential delays in
    execution context.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value always indicates active movement,
    as the method might return stale data if the trigger's state has changed since
    last update. Always validate the trigger's existence and validity before calling
    this method.
