  class: RotationPriority
  method: UpdatePriority
  signature: void RotationPriority::UpdatePriority(uint32 spellId, float newPriority)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the priority value for a specified spell in the rotation priority
    system.
  description: The UpdatePriority method modifies the priority level assigned to a
    specific spell within the rotation priority system. This functionality is typically
    used by AI systems or scriptable behaviors to dynamically adjust spell casting
    priorities based on combat conditions, resource availability, or other game state
    factors. The method accepts a spell identifier and a new priority value, updating
    the internal mapping of spell IDs to their respective priority levels. This allows
    for flexible and responsive spell selection logic that can adapt to changing battlefield
    scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell whose priority needs to be updated.
      This should correspond to a valid Spell ID defined in the game's spell database.
  - name: newPriority
    description: The new priority value to assign to the specified spell. Priority
      values are typically floating-point numbers where higher values indicate higher
      casting priority. The exact interpretation of these values may depend on the
      implementation details of the rotation system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'RotationPriority rotation;

      rotation.UpdatePriority(12345, 9.5f); // Sets spell ID 12345 to priority 9.5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Priority Adjustment
    code: "void UpdateCombatPriority(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30)\n        rotation.UpdatePriority(12345, 10.0f); // Increase priority\
      \ for healing spell\n    else\n        rotation.UpdatePriority(12345, 5.0f);\
      \  // Decrease priority\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state and should be used carefully
    in multi-threaded environments. The priority values are usually interpreted relative
    to other spells in the same rotation system. It's recommended to call this method
    only when necessary to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Modifying spell priorities during active combat or AI processing may lead
    to inconsistent behavior if not synchronized properly with the AI decision-making
    loop. Ensure that spell IDs passed to this method are valid and exist in the game's
    spell database to prevent undefined behavior.
