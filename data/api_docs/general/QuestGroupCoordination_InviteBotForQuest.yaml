  class: QuestGroupCoordination
  method: InviteBotForQuest
  signature: bool QuestGroupCoordination::InviteBotForQuest(Group * group, uint32
    questId, GroupRole neededRole)
documentation:
  brief: Invites a bot player to join a group for a specific quest based on required
    role.
  description: The InviteBotForQuest method attempts to invite a bot player into an
    existing group with the specified quest ID and required role. This function is
    typically used in automated quest coordination systems where bots are dispatched
    to assist players in completing quests. It checks if the group has space, verifies
    that the bot meets the required role criteria, and ensures the quest is valid
    before proceeding with the invitation. The method returns true upon successful
    invitation or false if any precondition fails.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group to which the bot
      will be invited. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the bot is being invited.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: neededRole
    description: The required role that the bot must fulfill within the group for
      this quest. Defines the bot's participation level (e.g., tank, healer, damage
      dealer).
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully invited to the group for the specified
    quest and role; otherwise returns false if the invitation fails due to invalid
    parameters, full group capacity, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Invitation
    code: "Group* myGroup = ...;\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nGroupRole role = GROUP_ROLE_TANK;\n\
      bool result = sQuestGroupCoordination->InviteBotForQuest(myGroup, questId, role);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Bot successfully invited\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Invitation with Error Handling
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (!group || !group->IsLeader(player))\
      \ {\n    return false;\n}\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nGroupRole role = GROUP_ROLE_HEALER;\n\
      bool success = sQuestGroupCoordination->InviteBotForQuest(group, questId, role);\n\
      if (!success) {\n    // Handle invitation failure\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Failed to invite bot for quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Group object is valid and properly initialized.
    The bot must be registered with the system and capable of fulfilling the required
    role. Performance may be impacted if multiple bots are invited simultaneously
    in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the group has available slots before calling this method,
    as attempting to invite a bot to a full group will result in failure. Also, verify
    that the quest ID exists and is valid to prevent runtime errors or unexpected
    behavior.
