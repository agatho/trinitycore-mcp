  class: EvokerAI
  method: ShouldConserveEssence
  signature: bool EvokerAI::ShouldConserveEssence()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the evoker should conserve essence based on current game
    state and resource management.
  description: The ShouldConserveEssence method evaluates the evoker's current situation
    to decide if it should prioritize conserving essence rather than spending it on
    abilities. This decision is typically influenced by factors such as available
    essence reserves, incoming damage, and the urgency of maintaining defensive or
    utility spells. The method plays a crucial role in the evoker's AI behavior, helping
    to optimize resource usage for maximum effectiveness during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the evoker should conserve essence; otherwise returns false.
    A return value of true indicates that the AI has determined it is more beneficial
    to preserve essence for future use rather than expend it immediately.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (evokerAI->ShouldConserveEssence()) {\n    // Avoid spending essence\
      \ on non-essential abilities\n    evokerAI->DoNotCastEssenceSpendingAbility();\n\
      } else {\n    // Proceed with normal ability usage\n    evokerAI->CastNextAvailableAbility();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal state tracking of essence levels,
    threat assessment, and cooldown management. It may be called frequently during
    combat updates to make real-time decisions about resource allocation.
