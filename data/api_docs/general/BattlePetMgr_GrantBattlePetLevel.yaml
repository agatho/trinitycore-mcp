  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: GrantBattlePetLevel
  signature: void BattlePetMgr::GrantBattlePetLevel(int guid, int grantedLevels)
documentation:
  brief: Grants specified levels to a battle pet identified by its GUID.
  description: The GrantBattlePetLevel method increases the level of a battle pet
    within the BattlePetMgr system. This function takes a unique identifier (GUID)
    for a specific battle pet and adds the provided number of levels to that pet's
    current level. The method operates on the player's collection of battle pets,
    modifying their experience and progression. It is typically used in game mechanics
    where players earn rewards or complete quests that grant pet leveling bonuses.
    This function does not validate whether the GUID corresponds to an existing pet
    or if the granted levels are within acceptable bounds; it assumes valid inputs.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet to be leveled up.
      This value identifies a specific pet within the player's collection.
  - name: grantedLevels
    description: The number of levels to grant to the specified battle pet. Positive
      values increase the level, while negative values would decrease it if supported
      by the underlying implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Grant 5 Levels to a Battle Pet
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* mgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      mgr->GrantBattlePetLevel(123456, 5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Award Multiple Pets with Levels
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < petCount; ++i)\n{\n    mgr->GrantBattlePetLevel(petGuids[i],\
      \ 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of a battle pet directly. It is recommended
    to call this function after ensuring that the GUID refers to an active and valid
    pet in the player's collection. The method does not trigger any UI updates or
    notifications; additional logic may be required to reflect changes in the client.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid battle pet, as invalid
    inputs might lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be cautious with large
    values for grantedLevels, as they could cause unexpected level progression or
    overflow issues depending on the game's internal limits.
