  method: IVMapManager
  signature: void IVMapManager::IVMapManager()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the IVMapManager class for managing virtual
    map data in the TrinityCore server.
  description: The IVMapManager constructor initializes the virtual map manager component
    responsible for handling terrain, height maps, and navigation data for World of
    Warcraft instances. This class is part of the TrinityCore's map management system
    that allows the server to load, unload, and query map-related information for
    different zones and instances. The initialization process typically sets up internal
    data structures, loads required configuration files, and prepares the manager
    to handle map queries for player movement, line-of-sight checks, and navigation
    pathfinding. This constructor is usually called during server startup or when
    a new instance needs to be initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'IVMapManager* vmapManager = new IVMapManager();

      // The manager is now ready to handle map queries

      bool hasMap = vmapManager->isInLineOfSight(0, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 400.0f,
      500.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method and should only be called during object instantiation.
    The IVMapManager typically manages multiple map files and requires proper server
    configuration to function correctly. It's designed to be thread-safe for concurrent
    access during gameplay operations.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you're implementing a custom
    map manager or extending the core functionality. The IVMapManager is usually instantiated
    through the global MapManager singleton in TrinityCore. Improper initialization
    may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior when querying map data.
