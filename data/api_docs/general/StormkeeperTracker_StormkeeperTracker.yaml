  brief: Initializes a new instance of the StormkeeperTracker class
  description: The StormkeeperTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    StormkeeperTracker class. This method sets up the internal state and data structures
    required for tracking stormkeeper-related events or entities within the TrinityCore
    framework. The constructor typically performs essential setup operations such
    as initializing member variables, allocating memory, and configuring any necessary
    game mechanics components related to stormkeepers. It is automatically called
    when a new StormkeeperTracker object is created.

  returns: null

  notes: This is a default constructor that performs minimal initialization. Developers
    should be aware that additional setup may be required after construction depending
    on the specific implementation details of the StormkeeperTracker class.
