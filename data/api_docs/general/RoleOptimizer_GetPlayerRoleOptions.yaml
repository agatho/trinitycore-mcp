  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: GetPlayerRoleOptions
  signature: int RoleOptimizer::GetPlayerRoleOptions(const int & players, const OptimizationConstraints
    & constraints)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns optimal role assignments for a given number of players
    based on specified optimization constraints.
  description: The GetPlayerRoleOptions method determines the best possible role distribution
    among a specified number of players within the context of World of Warcraft's
    raid or group dynamics. It evaluates various factors such as player class, specialization,
    gear level, and performance metrics to compute an optimal set of roles that maximize
    efficiency or meet specific gameplay objectives defined by the provided constraints.
    This method is typically used in automated raid planning systems or role assignment
    algorithms within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: The number of players for whom role options are being calculated.
      Must be a positive integer representing the total player count in the group
      or raid.
  - name: constraints
    description: An OptimizationConstraints object that defines the rules and limitations
      for role assignment, such as required class distributions, minimum gear levels,
      or performance thresholds.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal role configuration.
    A positive return indicates successful computation with valid role assignments;
    a negative value may indicate an error condition such as invalid input parameters
    or constraint violations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetPlayerRoleOptions
    code: "int playerCount = 25;\nOptimizationConstraints constraints;\nconstraints.requiredClasses\
      \ = {CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_MAGE, CLASS_PRIEST};\nint result = roleOptimizer.GetPlayerRoleOptions(playerCount,\
      \ constraints);\nif (result > 0) {\n    // Role options successfully computed\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with complex constraints
    code: "int playerCount = 10;\nOptimizationConstraints constraints;\nconstraints.minGearLevel\
      \ = 350;\nconstraints.maxRoleRatio = {ROLE_TANK, 0.2f}; // Max 20% tanks\nconstraints.requiredSpecializations\
      \ = {SPECIALIZATION_PROTECTION, SPECIALIZATION_BALANCE};\nint result = roleOptimizer.GetPlayerRoleOptions(playerCount,\
      \ constraints);\nif (result < 0) {\n    // Handle constraint violation or invalid\
      \ input\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be used in conjunction with other role optimization
    utilities within TrinityCore. It assumes that player data has already been loaded
    and validated. The method may perform computationally intensive operations, especially
    for large groups or complex constraint sets.
  warnings: Ensure that the OptimizationConstraints object passed to this method contains
    valid and consistent values to avoid unexpected behavior or incorrect role assignments.
    Passing invalid player counts (e.g., negative numbers) will likely result in undefined
    behavior.
