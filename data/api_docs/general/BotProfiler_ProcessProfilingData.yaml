documentation:
  brief: Processes and analyzes profiling data collected from bot behavior and performance
    metrics.
  description: The ProcessProfilingData method is responsible for analyzing and handling
    profiling information gathered from various bot activities within the TrinityCore
    environment. This method typically processes performance-related data such as
    execution times, resource usage, and behavioral patterns of AI-controlled characters
    (bots). It may aggregate statistics, identify bottlenecks, or prepare reports
    for debugging and optimization purposes. The method is usually invoked during
    specific intervals or upon completion of profiling sessions to ensure accurate
    tracking of bot performance over time.

  - title: Basic Usage in Profiling Context
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.ProcessProfilingData(); // Processes collected profiling data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot management system and
    should not be invoked manually unless part of a custom profiling or debugging
    workflow. It may involve heavy computation depending on the amount of collected
    data.
