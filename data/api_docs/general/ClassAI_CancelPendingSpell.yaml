documentation:
  brief: Cancels any pending spell cast that is currently queued or in progress for
    the AI-controlled unit.
  description: The CancelPendingSpell method is used to interrupt and cancel any ongoing
    or queued spell casting by an AI-controlled creature. This function is typically
    invoked when the AI needs to immediately stop casting a spell due to changes in
    combat state, target switching, or other tactical decisions. It ensures that the
    spell cast is terminated without completing its normal execution sequence. The
    method does not return any value and operates directly on the internal spell queue
    of the ClassAI instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Cancel any pending spell before\
      \ starting new combat behavior\n    CancelPendingSpell();\n    // Proceed with\
      \ new spell casting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupting Spell Cast on Target Change
    code: "void OnTargetChanged(Unit* newTarget)\n{\n    if (newTarget != nullptr\
      \ && !newTarget->IsInCombat())\n    {\n        // Cancel pending spell when\
      \ target is no longer valid\n        CancelPendingSpell();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can interrupt important spell
    effects. It's recommended to check if a spell is actually pending before calling
    this function to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Calling CancelPendingSpell while the AI is in a critical spell cast sequence
    may lead to inconsistent state if not properly handled by the AI logic. Ensure
    that all spell-related state is reset appropriately after cancellation.
