  brief: Moves the contents of another OutdoorPvP object to this object
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the right-hand side OutdoorPvP object to the left-hand side object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where an OutdoorPvP instance needs to be replaced
    with another existing instance, such as during container reallocation or when
    swapping objects. The method efficiently transfers internal data members and ensures
    that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state. In the context
    of TrinityCore's OutdoorPvP system, this operator supports efficient resource
    management for dynamic outdoor player-versus-player zones.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current OutdoorPvP object after the move assignment
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'OutdoorPvP pvp1;

      OutdoorPvP pvp2 = std::move(pvp1);

      // pvp1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // pvp2 contains the moved resources from pvp1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics standard and should be used
    with caution to avoid unintended resource transfers. The moved-from object remains
    in a valid state but its contents are unspecified, so it should not be used after
    a move operation unless explicitly reset.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that the source object is not accessed after being moved
    from, and be aware that move semantics may not provide strong exception safety
    guarantees in all cases.
