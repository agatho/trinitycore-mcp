  method: ~WaypointMgr
  signature: void WaypointMgr::~WaypointMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the WaypointMgr instance and cleans up all associated waypoint data.
  description: The ~WaypointMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all memory and resources allocated by the WaypointMgr class. This includes deallocating
    any stored waypoint paths, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no
    memory leaks occur when the manager is destroyed. The destructor is automatically
    called when a WaypointMgr object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's
    important to note that this method should not be called directly unless managing
    the object's lifetime manually, as it's typically invoked by the C++ runtime during
    object destruction.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of WaypointMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    WaypointMgr* mgr = new WaypointMgr();\n    //\
      \ ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack allocation with automatic destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction() {\n    WaypointMgr mgr; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when\
      \ mgr goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for preventing
    memory leaks. It's recommended to let the C++ runtime handle destruction automatically
    through stack allocation or smart pointers rather than manual deletion, unless
    specific lifetime management is required.
