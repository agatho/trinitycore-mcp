  class: Aura
  method: GetWeakPtr
  signature: int Aura::GetWeakPtr() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the weak pointer identifier associated with this aura instance.
  description: The GetWeakPtr method retrieves the weak pointer identifier of the
    Aura object. In TrinityCore's implementation, auras are managed using smart pointers
    to handle memory management and prevent dangling references. The weak pointer
    is used internally to track references to the aura without preventing its destruction.
    This method allows external code to access the weak pointer value for debugging,
    logging, or reference tracking purposes. The returned integer represents an internal
    identifier that uniquely identifies this specific aura instance within the context
    of the weak pointer system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the weak pointer identifier associated with this
    aura instance. This value is used internally by TrinityCore's memory management
    system to track aura references and ensure proper cleanup when the aura is no
    longer needed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve aura weak pointer
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    int weakPtr = aura->GetWeakPtr();\n\
      \    // Use weakPtr for debugging or tracking purposes\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Aura weak pointer: %d\", weakPtr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for internal use within TrinityCore's core
    systems. The returned value should not be used for direct manipulation of the
    aura object, as it's an internal identifier. Developers should be aware that this
    value may change between different versions or builds of TrinityCore.
  warnings: Do not rely on the specific numeric value returned by GetWeakPtr for any
    gameplay logic, as it's an implementation detail. The value is primarily useful
    for debugging and tracking aura references within the core system.
