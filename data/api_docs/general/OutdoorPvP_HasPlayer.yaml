documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific player is currently registered in the OutdoorPvP
    system.
  description: The HasPlayer method determines if a given Player object is currently
    tracked by the OutdoorPvP instance. This check is typically used to verify if
    a player is participating in or affected by the OutdoorPvP zone's mechanics, such
    as capturing territories or engaging in PvP activities. The method performs a
    lookup within the internal tracking structures of the OutdoorPvP system to confirm
    the player's presence. It does not validate the player's current location or active
    state beyond their registration in the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is currently registered with this
    OutdoorPvP instance, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the
    player has been added to the system's tracking list, which may imply they are
    participating in OutdoorPvP activities or have entered a relevant area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (outdoorPvP->HasPlayer(player)) {\n    // Player is registered with\
      \ this OutdoorPvP instance\n    SendMessageToPlayer(player, \"You are currently\
      \ in an Outdoor PvP zone.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Events
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterOutdoorPvP(Player* player) {\n    if (!outdoorPvP->HasPlayer(player))\
      \ {\n        outdoorPvP->AddPlayer(player); // Register the player\n    }\n\
      }\n\nvoid OnPlayerLeaveOutdoorPvP(Player* player) {\n    if (outdoorPvP->HasPlayer(player))\
      \ {\n        outdoorPvP->RemovePlayer(player); // Unregister the player\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation, so performance may vary depending
    on how many players are registered with the OutdoorPvP instance. The internal
    implementation likely uses a container such as std::set or std::unordered_set
    for efficient lookups. This method should not be used to determine if a player
    is in the actual zone, but rather whether they are registered with the OutdoorPvP
    system.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method's return value for critical gameplay
    logic. If a player is removed from the OutdoorPvP system without proper cleanup,
    HasPlayer may still return true until the next update cycle. Ensure that AddPlayer
    and RemovePlayer calls are properly synchronized with player state changes to
    avoid inconsistencies.
