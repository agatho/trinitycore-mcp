  signature: bool MovementRequest::IsDuplicateOf(const MovementRequest & other) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares this movement request with another to determine if they are duplicates.
  description: The IsDuplicateOf method checks whether the current MovementRequest
    object is a duplicate of another MovementRequest object. This comparison typically
    involves examining key properties such as position, orientation, and movement
    type to determine if two requests represent the same movement action. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method helps prevent redundant
    movement processing and ensures efficient handling of player or creature movements.
    The method performs a logical comparison between the internal state of both objects
    and returns true if they are considered duplicates, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: The MovementRequest object to compare against this instance. This
      parameter represents another movement request that may potentially be a duplicate
      of the current one.
  returns: Returns true if the current MovementRequest is considered a duplicate of
    the provided 'other' MovementRequest; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Duplicate Check
    code: 'MovementRequest request1;

      MovementRequest request2;

      // Assume both requests have same properties

      bool isDuplicate = request1.IsDuplicateOf(request2);

      // isDuplicate will be true if the movement data matches'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Movement Handling Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(MovementRequest& newRequest) {\n    for (const\
      \ auto& existingRequest : pendingRequests) {\n        if (newRequest.IsDuplicateOf(existingRequest))\
      \ {\n            // Skip processing duplicate request\n            return;\n\
      \        }\n    }\n    // Process new movement request\n    pendingRequests.push_back(newRequest);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's movement system to
    optimize performance by avoiding redundant processing of identical movement requests.
    It may use a combination of position coordinates, orientation data, and movement
    type flags for comparison.
