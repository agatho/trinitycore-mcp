  class: Creature
  method: SetTarget
  signature: void Creature::SetTarget(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target GUID for the creature, allowing it to engage in combat with
    a specified unit.
  description: The SetTarget method assigns a target GUID to a Creature object, enabling
    it to initiate combat with a specific unit. This method is commonly used in AI
    scripts and game mechanics to control creature behavior during encounters. The
    target GUID typically refers to a player or another creature's unique identifier,
    and when set, the creature will engage in combat with that target. This method
    is essential for implementing proper creature AI behavior and managing combat
    state within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to which the creature
      should set its target. This can be a player, creature, or any other entity with
      a valid GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Target Setting Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->SetTarget(12345);

      // Creature now targets player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Target Setting with AI Script
    code: "void CreatureAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Set target to player\n    SetTarget(player->GetGUID());\n\
      }\n// This method is typically used in AI scripts to control creature behavior\
      \ during combat"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the creature's
    combat state. The target GUID must be valid and exist within the game world for
    this method to work properly. Implementation details include ensuring that the
    target is not null or invalid before setting.
  warnings: Setting an invalid or non-existent GUID can cause runtime errors or unexpected
    behavior in creature AI. Care should be taken to ensure the target GUID is valid
    before calling this method.
