  class: FeralBleedTracker
  method: ApplyRake
  signature: void FeralBleedTracker::ApplyRake(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Rake ability to a target, initiating or refreshing a bleed effect
    with specified duration.
  description: The ApplyRake method is responsible for applying the Rake ability to
    a target unit within the Feral Bleed Tracker system. This method typically manages
    the application of a bleed effect that deals periodic damage over time. The method
    takes a unique identifier (GUID) of the target and a duration value in milliseconds,
    which determines how long the bleed effect will persist. It is commonly used in
    feral druid gameplay mechanics where Rake is a key ability for generating combo
    points and dealing sustained damage. The implementation likely involves updating
    internal tracking structures to monitor active bleed effects on targets and scheduling
    their expiration.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit that will receive
      the Rake effect. This value identifies the specific creature or player in the
      game world.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Rake bleed effect should
      remain active on the target. This determines how long the periodic damage will
      be applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ApplyRake
    code: 'FeralBleedTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyRake(12345, 15000); // Applies Rake to target with GUID 12345 for
      15 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Rake in Combat Context
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    FeralBleedTracker\
      \ tracker;\n    tracker.ApplyRake(target->GetGUID(), 12000); // Apply Rake for\
      \ 12 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's combat system to ensure proper
    application of the bleed effect. The implementation may involve checking if a
    similar effect is already active on the target and refreshing its duration rather
    than applying multiple instances. It should be called only when the player has
    sufficient combo points or meets other prerequisites for using Rake.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the target is valid or that
    the player can use Rake may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the GUID
    corresponds to a valid unit and that the duration is within reasonable bounds
    to prevent excessive resource consumption.
