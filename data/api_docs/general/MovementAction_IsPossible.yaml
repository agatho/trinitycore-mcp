  class: MovementAction
  method: IsPossible
  signature: bool MovementAction::IsPossible(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a movement action can be executed by the bot AI.
  description: The IsPossible method evaluates if a given movement action is currently
    feasible for execution within the context of the bot's AI state. It checks various
    conditions such as the bot's current location, movement restrictions, environmental
    obstacles, and other game-specific constraints that might prevent the action from
    being carried out. This method is typically called before attempting to execute
    a movement action to avoid invalid or harmful operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the movement action can be executed under current conditions;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (movementAction.IsPossible(ai)) {\n    // Proceed with movement execution\n\
      \    ai->ExecuteMovement(movementAction);\n} else {\n    // Handle impossible\
      \ movement case\n    ai->Log(\"Movement action not possible\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during AI decision-making loops to
    ensure that only valid actions are attempted. It may perform lightweight checks
    such as position validation or state verification, but it's not intended for heavy
    computational tasks.
