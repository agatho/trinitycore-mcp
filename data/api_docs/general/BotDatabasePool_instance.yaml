  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: instance
  signature: BotDatabasePool * BotDatabasePool::instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotDatabasePool class.
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotDatabasePool
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the database connection pool exists
    throughout the application lifecycle. This method is typically used to obtain
    a reference to the global database pool responsible for managing connections to
    the bot-related database tables in TrinityCore. The returned pointer should be
    used directly without attempting to delete it, as the singleton manages its own
    lifetime. This pattern is essential for maintaining consistent database access
    and preventing resource leaks in multi-threaded environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotDatabasePool instance. The method never returns
    NULL under normal circumstances as the singleton is initialized during application
    startup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotDatabasePool* pool = BotDatabasePool::instance();

      // Use pool for database operations

      PreparedStatement* stmt = pool->GetPreparedStatement(BOT_QUERIES::SELECT_BOT_DATA);

      stmt->setUInt32(0, botId);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The singleton
    instance is created on first access and persists for the lifetime of the application.
    It's important to note that while this returns a pointer to the database pool,
    actual database operations should use the provided prepared statements or connection
    methods rather than direct SQL execution.
