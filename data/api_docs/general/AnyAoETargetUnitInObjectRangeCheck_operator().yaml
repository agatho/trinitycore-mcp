documentation:
  brief: Checks if a unit is within range for area-of-effect targeting.
  description: The AnyAoETargetUnitInObjectRangeCheck::operator() method evaluates
    whether a given unit (represented by its GUID) falls within the specified range
    for area-of-effect spell targeting. This check is typically used in AI and spell
    systems to determine valid targets for AoE effects. The method performs range
    validation against the object that owns this checker, ensuring that only units
    within the defined radius are considered valid targets. It's commonly employed
    in combat logic where spells affect multiple enemies within a certain proximity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is within the specified range and can be targeted
    by area-of-effect spells; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Target Selection
    code: "class MySpellAI\n{\npublic:\n    bool IsTargetInRange(Unit* target)\n \
      \   {\n        AnyAoETargetUnitInObjectRangeCheck check(this, 10.0f); // 10\
      \ yard range\n        return check(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other targeting logic to
    filter valid AoE targets. The range check is performed using the object's current
    position and the target unit's position, making it suitable for dynamic environments
    where units are moving.
