documentation:
  brief: Copies the state and configuration of another BotCharacterDistribution instance
  description: This method performs a deep copy operation, duplicating all internal
    state and configuration settings from the provided BotCharacterDistribution parameter.
    It is typically used when creating new instances based on existing configurations
    or when merging distribution settings between different bot character groups.
    The copied instance maintains identical properties but operates independently,
    allowing for flexible distribution management within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotCharacterDistribution object whose state and configuration
      will be copied
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying Bot Character Distribution Configuration
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution original;

      // Configure original distribution...

      BotCharacterDistribution copy(original); // Uses the copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      BotCharacterDistribution anotherCopy;

      anotherCopy = original; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating New Distribution Based on Existing Settings
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void CreateNewDistribution(const BotCharacterDistribution&\
      \ baseConfig) {\n        BotCharacterDistribution newDistribution(baseConfig);\n\
      \        // Modify newDistribution as needed\n        // Use newDistribution\
      \ for new bot character assignments\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely implements a copy constructor pattern, which means it
    will perform member-wise copying of all relevant data members. Developers should
    be aware that if the class contains pointers or references to dynamically allocated
    memory, special care must be taken to avoid shallow copying issues.
