api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: GetDetailedValidationReport
  signature: std::string QuestValidation::GetDetailedValidationReport(uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a detailed validation report for a specified quest, including all
    relevant checks and findings.
  description: The GetDetailedValidationReport method performs a comprehensive evaluation
    of a quest's validity within the TrinityCore framework. It analyzes various aspects
    of the quest such as prerequisites, objectives, rewards, and dependencies to ensure
    the quest conforms to game design standards and does not contain logical inconsistencies
    or errors. The method returns a formatted string containing detailed information
    about any issues found during validation, including missing data, incorrect configurations,
    or potential exploits. This functionality is primarily used for debugging, quality
    assurance, and automated quest testing within development environments.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate. Must be a valid quest
      ID present in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player instance
      performing the validation. Used for context-aware checks and may influence certain
      validation rules.
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted report detailing all validation findings
    for the specified quest. The report includes information about quest status, missing
    components, configuration errors, and other potential issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation Report Generation
    code: 'uint32 questId = 12345;

      Player* playerBot = ...; // Valid player pointer

      std::string report = QuestValidation::GetDetailedValidationReport(questId, playerBot);

      TC_LOG_INFO("quest", "Validation Report: %s", report.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Validation Report for Automated Testing
    code: "void TestQuest(uint32 questId)\n{\n    Player* testBot = ...; // Initialize\
      \ test bot\n    std::string report = QuestValidation::GetDetailedValidationReport(questId,\
      \ testBot);\n    if (report.find(\"ERROR\") != std::string::npos)\n    {\n \
      \       TC_LOG_ERROR(\"quest\", \"Quest %u failed validation: %s\", questId,\
      \ report.c_str());\n        // Handle error or mark quest as invalid\n    }\n\
      \    else\n    {\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"quest\", \"Quest %u passed validation\
      \ successfully.\", questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs extensive database queries and logic checks, so it should
    not be called frequently in performance-critical sections. The validation process
    may include checking related quest data, item requirements, NPC interactions,
    and reward structures. The returned report is intended for debugging purposes
    and may contain technical details that are not suitable for end-user display.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid questId or null player pointer may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper input validation before
    invoking the method. The method assumes all required database entries exist and
    are properly configured; missing data might cause incomplete reports or errors.
