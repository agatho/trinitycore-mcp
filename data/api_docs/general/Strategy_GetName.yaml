  brief: Returns the name of the strategy used by the AI system
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name identifier associated
    with a specific AI strategy object. This name is typically used for logging, debugging,
    and identifying which strategy is currently active during AI decision-making processes.
    The returned string is constant and should not be modified directly. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI framework, strategies define different behavioral patterns
    that creatures or NPCs can follow, making this method essential for monitoring
    and managing AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the name of the strategy.
    The string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty for properly initialized strategy
    objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Strategy* myStrategy = new SomeConcreteStrategy();

      std::cout << "Current strategy: " << myStrategy->GetName() << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Strategy Name
    code: "void LogActiveStrategy(Unit* unit) {\n    if (unit && unit->GetAI()) {\n\
      \        std::string strategyName = unit->GetAI()->GetCurrentStrategy()->GetName();\n\
      \        LOG_INFO(\"ai\", \"Active strategy for {} is: {}\", unit->GetName(),\
      \ strategyName);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference is valid only as long as the Strategy object
    exists. This method is typically implemented as a simple getter that returns a
    member variable, making it very fast with O(1) time complexity. It's thread-safe
    if the underlying strategy object is not modified concurrently.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned string reference as it's const.
    If the Strategy object has not been properly initialized or configured, the behavior
    of GetName is undefined and may result in an empty or invalid string.
