  class: ArenaTeam
  method: GetType
  signature: uint32 ArenaTeam::GetType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the type identifier of the arena team.
  description: The GetType method retrieves the type of arena team, which determines
    the format and rules for the team's gameplay. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, arena teams can be of different types such as 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5,
    each with distinct mechanics and matchmaking criteria. This value is used internally
    by the game server to enforce appropriate rules, handle matchmaking, and manage
    rewards based on team composition. The method does not require any parameters
    and returns a constant value that defines the arena type for this specific team
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the arena team type. Common values include
    2 for 2v2 teams, 3 for 3v3 teams, and 5 for 5v5 teams. This identifier is used
    to determine gameplay mechanics and reward distribution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sObjectAccessor->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nuint32 teamType\
      \ = team->GetType();\nif (teamType == 2)\n{\n    // Handle 2v2 specific logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Matchmaking Logic
    code: "void ProcessArenaMatchmaking(ArenaTeam* team)\n{\n    uint32 type = team->GetType();\n\
      \    switch (type)\n    {\n        case 2:\n            // Matchmake for 2v2\n\
      \            break;\n        case 3:\n            // Matchmake for 3v3\n   \
      \         break;\n        case 5:\n            // Matchmake for 5v5\n      \
      \      break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The arena team type is set when the team is created and remains constant
    throughout its lifetime. This value directly affects how the game server handles
    player matchmaking, scoring, and rewards distribution for each specific arena
    format.
