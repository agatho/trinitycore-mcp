documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of queued bot spawn events in the event bus.
  description: The GetQueuedEventCount method retrieves the current count of bot spawn
    events that are pending execution within the BotSpawnEventBus. This counter represents
    how many events have been added to the queue but not yet processed. The method
    is typically used for monitoring and debugging purposes to understand the workload
    of the event bus. It provides a snapshot of the queue size at the time of invocation,
    which can be useful for performance tuning or identifying potential bottlenecks
    in bot spawning operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of events currently queued for processing
    in the BotSpawnEventBus. Returns zero if no events are queued.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor queued events
    code: "uint32 queuedCount = sBotSpawnEventBus->GetQueuedEventCount();\nif (queuedCount\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: %u bot spawn events queued\", queuedCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    count is volatile and may change immediately after the call, so it should not
    be used for synchronization purposes. This method does not modify any internal
    state of the event bus.
