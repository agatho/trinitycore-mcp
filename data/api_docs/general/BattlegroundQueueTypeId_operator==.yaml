documentation:
  brief: Compares two battleground queue type identifiers for equality
  description: The operator== method performs a comparison between this BattlegroundQueueTypeId
    object and another BattlegroundQueueTypeId object to determine if they represent
    the same battleground queue type. This comparison is typically used in battleground
    queue management systems to check whether two queue types are identical, which
    is essential for maintaining proper queue organization and preventing duplicate
    entries. The method compares internal identifiers that uniquely define each battleground
    queue type within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The BattlegroundQueueTypeId object to compare against this instance
  returns: Returns true if both BattlegroundQueueTypeId objects represent the same
    queue type, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality comparison
    code: 'BattlegroundQueueTypeId queue1(1);

      BattlegroundQueueTypeId queue2(1);

      bool isEqual = (queue1 == queue2); // Returns true


      BattlegroundQueueTypeId queue3(2);

      bool isNotEqual = (queue1 == queue3); // Returns false'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in battleground queue logic
    code: "class BGQueueManager {\npublic:\n    bool IsQueueTypeActive(BattlegroundQueueTypeId\
      \ typeId) {\n        for (const auto& activeQueue : activeQueues_) {\n     \
      \       if (activeQueue == typeId) {\n                return true;\n       \
      \     }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\nprivate:\n    std::vector<BattlegroundQueueTypeId>\
      \ activeQueues_;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is implemented as a const method and does not modify the state
    of either object. The comparison relies on the internal identifier values stored
    within each BattlegroundQueueTypeId instance, which are typically assigned based
    on battleground type IDs or queue type configurations.
