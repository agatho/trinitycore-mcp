  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: SetFacing
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetFacing(const Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Configures the movement spline to face a specified target unit.
  description: The SetFacing method initializes the movement spline to orient towards
    a given target unit. This is commonly used in AI behaviors where creatures need
    to turn and move toward specific targets, such as players or other units. The
    method sets up the spline's facing direction based on the target's position relative
    to the mover. It typically prepares the spline for subsequent movement operations
    that require proper orientation. This method does not immediately execute movement
    but rather configures the facing angle for later use in spline execution.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that the mover should face towards. Must
      be a valid unit instance, typically a player or another NPC. The target's position
      is used to calculate the required facing angle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_NEAREST,\
      \ 0))\n    {\n        MoveSplineInit init(*me);\n        init.SetFacing(target);\n\
      \        // Further movement setup would follow\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting facing before movement to target
    code: "void DoMovementToTarget(Unit* target)\n{\n    MoveSplineInit init(*me);\n\
      \    init.SetFacing(target);\n    init.MoveTo(target->GetPositionX(), target->GetPositionY(),\
      \ target->GetPositionZ());\n    init.SetWalk(false);\n    init.Launch();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal facing configuration of the MoveSplineInit
    object. It should be called before any movement commands to ensure proper orientation.
    The facing angle is calculated using the target's position and the mover's current
    location, taking into account the unit's orientation properties.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer may cause undefined behavior or crashes. This method does
    not validate whether the target is within line of sight or reachable - that should
    be handled by the calling code.
