  method: RegisterPopulationCallback
  signature: void IBotSpawnerEvents::RegisterPopulationCallback(PopulationCallback
    callback)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a callback function to be invoked when bot population changes occur.
  description: The RegisterPopulationCallback method allows external systems or modules
    to register a delegate function that will be automatically called whenever the
    bot spawning system experiences changes in population. This callback mechanism
    enables real-time monitoring and reaction to dynamic bot counts within the game
    world. The registered callback receives notifications about population events
    such as bot creation, destruction, or state transitions, making it useful for
    maintaining synchronization with external systems or implementing custom behaviors
    based on current bot density.
  parameters:
  - name: callback
    description: A PopulationCallback function pointer that will be invoked when population
      events occur. The callback should accept appropriate parameters related to the
      population change event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Callback Registration
    code: "void MyBotEventHandler(BotPopulationEvent event) {\n    // Handle bot population\
      \ change\n    switch(event.type) {\n        case BOT_ADDED:\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      New bot added to world\");\n            break;\n        case BOT_REMOVED:\n\
      \            sLog->outString(\"Bot removed from world\");\n            break;\n\
      \    }\n}\n\n// Register the callback\nbotSpawner->RegisterPopulationCallback(&MyBotEventHandler);"
    language: cpp
  notes: The callback registration is typically performed during system initialization
    or module loading. Multiple callbacks can be registered, and they will all be
    invoked in the order they were added. Callback functions should be lightweight
    to avoid performance degradation of the bot spawning system.
  warnings: Registering callbacks from within callback handlers may lead to undefined
    behavior or infinite loops. Ensure that callback implementations are thread-safe
    if they might be invoked from different execution contexts.
