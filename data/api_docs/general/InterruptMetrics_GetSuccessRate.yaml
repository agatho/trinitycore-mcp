  class: InterruptMetrics
  method: GetSuccessRate
  signature: float InterruptMetrics::GetSuccessRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the success rate percentage of interrupts for a given
    combat metric.
  description: The GetSuccessRate method computes the interrupt success rate based
    on stored interrupt metrics, typically used in combat analysis or player performance
    evaluation. This value represents how often an interrupt attempt was successful
    out of all attempts made. The calculation may involve internal counters or statistics
    maintained by the InterruptMetrics class, and it's expressed as a floating-point
    percentage value between 0.0 and 100.0. This method is commonly used in game mechanics
    related to spell interruption, ability blocking, or player combat effectiveness
    analysis.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the interrupt success rate as a percentage.
    Returns 0.0 if no interrupts have been recorded or if the internal counters are
    invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptMetrics metrics;

      // ... populate metrics with data ...

      float successRate = metrics.GetSuccessRate();

      std::cout << "Interrupt Success Rate: " << successRate << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis
    code: "InterruptMetrics playerInterrupts;\n// ... gather interrupt data from combat\
      \ log ...\nfloat rate = playerInterrupts.GetSuccessRate();\nif (rate > 75.0f)\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"High interrupt success rate detected\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else if (rate < 25.0f) {\n    std::cout << \"Low interrupt success rate -\
      \ consider skill improvement\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat analysis or player statistics
    updates. The accuracy of the returned value depends on the completeness and correctness
    of the internal interrupt tracking data. The method is marked as const, indicating
    it does not modify any member variables.
  warnings: Ensure that interrupt metrics have been properly initialized and populated
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected results. The method assumes valid
    internal state; calling it on an uninitialized or corrupted InterruptMetrics object
    may lead to undefined behavior.
