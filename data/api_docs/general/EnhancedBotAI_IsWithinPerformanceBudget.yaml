  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: IsWithinPerformanceBudget
  signature: bool EnhancedBotAI::IsWithinPerformanceBudget() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current bot's AI operations are within performance
    budget constraints.
  description: The IsWithinPerformanceBudget method checks if the EnhancedBotAI instance
    is currently operating within acceptable performance limits. This method evaluates
    various factors such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and frame time to ensure
    that the bot's artificial intelligence behavior does not negatively impact overall
    server performance. It is typically used internally by the AI system to make decisions
    about which actions to prioritize or defer based on current resource availability.
    The method returns true if the bot is within budget and false if it has exceeded
    performance thresholds, potentially triggering throttling or simplification of
    AI behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot's AI operations are within acceptable performance
    limits; returns false if performance budget has been exceeded, indicating that
    AI behavior should be reduced or simplified to maintain server stability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (botAI->IsWithinPerformanceBudget()) {\n    // Perform complex AI calculations\n\
      \    botAI->ExecuteAdvancedBehavior();\n} else {\n    // Fall back to simplified\
      \ behavior\n    botAI->ExecuteBasicBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is crucial for maintaining server performance in environments
    with many bots. It should be called frequently, ideally before any significant
    AI processing occurs. The exact budget thresholds may vary based on server configuration
    and current load.
