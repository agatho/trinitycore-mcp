  class: RoleDefinitions
  method: GetAvailableRoles
  signature: int RoleDefinitions::GetAvailableRoles(uint8 classId, uint8 specId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the available roles for a specified class and specialization in
    World of Warcraft.
  description: The GetAvailableRoles method returns an integer value representing
    the set of roles that are available for a given player class and specialization.
    This functionality is used within TrinityCore's role management system to determine
    what roles (such as tank, healer, or damage dealer) can be assigned to players
    based on their class and spec. The returned value typically encodes multiple possible
    roles using bit flags or similar mechanisms. This method is essential for dynamic
    role assignment in group scenarios such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds where
    player roles must be determined programmatically.
  parameters:
  - name: classId
    description: The unique identifier of the player's class (e.g., 1 for Warrior,
      2 for Paladin, etc.). Valid values are defined by the World of Warcraft class
      constants.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID within the specified class. For example, for
      Warrior, specId = 1 might represent Arms, specId = 2 could be Fury, and specId
      = 3 could be Protection.
  returns: An integer value representing the bitmask or set of available roles for
    the given class and specialization. Each bit or flag corresponds to a specific
    role type (e.g., tank, healer, damage). A return value of 0 typically indicates
    no roles are defined or an invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Get Available Roles for Warrior (Arms Spec)
    code: "int roles = roleDefs.GetAvailableRoles(1, 1); // Class ID 1 = Warrior,\
      \ Spec ID 1 = Arms\nif (roles & ROLE_DAMAGE)\n{\n    // Player can fulfill the\
      \ damage role\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for Tank Role Availability
    code: "int roles = roleDefs.GetAvailableRoles(7, 2); // Class ID 7 = Death Knight,\
      \ Spec ID 2 = Blood\nif (roles & ROLE_TANK)\n{\n    // Player is eligible to\
      \ be a tank\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal role definitions stored in TrinityCore's
    configuration or database tables that map class and specialization combinations
    to allowed roles. It may cache results for performance, especially when called
    frequently during group creation or role assignment processes.
  warnings: Ensure that both classId and specId are valid values before calling this
    method; invalid inputs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect role assignments.
    The returned integer should be interpreted according to the expected bit flags
    or role mapping used internally by TrinityCore.
