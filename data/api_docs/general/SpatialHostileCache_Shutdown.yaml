documentation:
  brief: Stops and cleans up all active spatial hostile cache operations
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing spatial hostile cache processes
    and releases associated resources. This method is typically called during server
    shutdown or when cleaning up spatial hostility tracking systems. It ensures that
    all cached hostile references are properly cleared and that no memory leaks occur
    from dangling pointers or active listeners. The method performs cleanup operations
    in a thread-safe manner to prevent race conditions during concurrent access.

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'SpatialHostileCache* cache = new SpatialHostileCache();

      // ... perform caching operations ...

      cache->Shutdown();

      delete cache;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no other threads are actively using
    the spatial hostile cache. It is recommended to call Shutdown before destroying
    the SpatialHostileCache instance to ensure proper resource deallocation.
