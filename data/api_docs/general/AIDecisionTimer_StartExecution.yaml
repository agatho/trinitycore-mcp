  signature: void AIDecisionTimer::StartExecution()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the AI decision timer execution process for an NPC or creature.
  description: The StartExecution method begins the timer-based decision-making process
    for an AI-controlled entity. This method is typically invoked when an AI needs
    to evaluate possible actions or transitions to a new state after a specified time
    interval has elapsed. It initializes internal timers and prepares the AI system
    to make decisions based on current conditions, such as target status, health levels,
    or environmental factors. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    no direct return operations; instead, it triggers asynchronous behavior within
    the AI framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_decisionTimer)\n \
      \       m_decisionTimer->StartExecution();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI system is properly initialized
    and the timer object is valid. It is commonly used in conjunction with other AI
    decision-making methods like Reset() or ExecuteDecision(). The timer's behavior
    may vary depending on whether it's a single-shot or repeating timer.
  warnings: Calling StartExecution on an uninitialized or destroyed AIDecisionTimer
    instance can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the timer object
    is in a valid state before invoking this method.
