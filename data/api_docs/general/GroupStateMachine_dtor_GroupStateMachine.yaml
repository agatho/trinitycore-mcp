documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GroupStateMachine instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GroupStateMachine class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up internal data structures, removing references to group members, and
    ensuring no dangling pointers remain. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this method ensures proper cleanup when a group state machine is no longer needed,
    such as when a player leaves a group or when the group is disbanded. The destructor
    is automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of GroupStateMachine
    code: 'GroupStateMachine* stateMachine = new GroupStateMachine();

      // ... use the state machine ...

      delete stateMachine; // Triggers ~GroupStateMachine()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It is important to ensure that all group-related operations are completed
    before destruction to avoid potential race conditions or memory leaks.
