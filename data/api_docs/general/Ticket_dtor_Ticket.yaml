documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Ticket object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The Ticket destructor is automatically invoked when a Ticket object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of any dynamically allocated memory, internal data structures, or references held
    by the ticket instance. In the context of TrinityCore's ticketing system, this
    typically involves releasing any allocated memory for ticket content, associated
    player references, and cleaning up internal tracking mechanisms. The destructor
    is a critical part of the object lifecycle management and should not be called
    manually unless explicitly needed for resource cleanup in specific scenarios.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of Ticket object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    Ticket* ticket = new Ticket();\n    // ...\
      \ use the ticket ...\n    delete ticket; // Destructor called here\n}\n\n//\
      \ Or with automatic storage:\nvoid AnotherFunction()\n{\n    Ticket ticket;\n\
      \    // Destructor automatically called when ticket goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived ticket types. It's important to note that this method should not be
    called directly unless you are explicitly managing object lifetime. The destructor
    does not throw exceptions and is expected to complete without errors.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke the destructor on stack-allocated objects as it
    will lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all pointers to Ticket objects are
    properly managed to avoid memory leaks or double-deletion issues.
