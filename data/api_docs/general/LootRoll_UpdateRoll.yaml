  class: LootRoll
  method: UpdateRoll
  signature: bool LootRoll::UpdateRoll()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the loot roll state and determines if the roll is still active.
  description: The UpdateRoll method processes the current loot roll state, checking
    whether the roll has completed or needs further updates. It evaluates the roll
    timer, handles player responses, and manages the transition of the loot item to
    the winning player. This method is typically called during the loot rolling process
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation to ensure proper handling of
    item distribution among group members. The method returns true if the roll is
    still active or has been successfully processed, and false if the roll has expired
    or failed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the loot roll is still active or has been successfully
    updated; returns false if the roll has expired, completed, or encountered an error
    during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Processing
    code: "LootRoll* roll = new LootRoll(12345, 100);\nif (roll->UpdateRoll()) {\n\
      \    // Roll is still active or updated successfully\n    // Continue processing\
      \ loot\n} else {\n    // Roll has completed or failed\n    // Handle cleanup\
      \ or notify players\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core loot system and should be called regularly
    during a loot roll to maintain proper state. It interacts with internal timers
    and player response tracking, so performance considerations are important in high-traffic
    scenarios.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly on a completed or expired roll as it
    may cause unexpected behavior or crashes. Always check the return value before
    proceeding with further actions related to the loot item.
