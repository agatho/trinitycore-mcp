  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: GetSuitableZones
  signature: int FarmingCoordinator::GetSuitableZones(int * player, ProfessionType
    profession) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of suitable zones for a player's farming profession.
  description: The GetSuitableZones method determines and returns the set of zones
    where a player can effectively engage in farming activities based on their current
    profession. This method evaluates the player's skill level, the zone's requirements,
    and any applicable restrictions to identify valid farming locations. It is typically
    used by the game's farming system to provide players with actionable zone recommendations
    for skill progression and resource gathering.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object for which suitable zones are being evaluated.
  - name: profession
    description: The type of profession (e.g., Herbalism, Mining, etc.) that determines
      the applicable farming zones.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of suitable zones found for
    the specified profession. A return value of zero indicates no valid zones were
    identified.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "FarmingCoordinator coordinator;\nint* player = getPlayer();\nProfessionType\
      \ herb = PROFESSION_HERBALISM;\nint zoneCount = coordinator.GetSuitableZones(player,\
      \ herb);\nif (zoneCount > 0) {\n    // Proceed with zone selection logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through Suitable Zones
    code: "FarmingCoordinator coordinator;\nint* player = getPlayer();\nProfessionType\
      \ mine = PROFESSION_MINING;\nint zoneCount = coordinator.GetSuitableZones(player,\
      \ mine);\nfor (int i = 0; i < zoneCount; ++i) {\n    // Access zone data via\
      \ internal zone list or index\n    ZoneInfo zone = getZoneByIndex(i);\n    printf(\"\
      Suitable zone: %s\\n\", zone.name);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may internally cache results for performance optimization. The
    returned zones are filtered based on player level, faction restrictions, and zone-specific
    farming mechanics. Developers should ensure the player object is valid and the
    profession type is correctly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer or invalid profession type
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player object is
    fully initialized and the profession is within expected range.
