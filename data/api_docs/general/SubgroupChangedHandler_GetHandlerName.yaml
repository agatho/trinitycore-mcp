  class: SubgroupChangedHandler
  method: GetHandlerName
  signature: std::string SubgroupChangedHandler::GetHandlerName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the subgroup changed handler for identification purposes.
  description: The GetHandlerName method retrieves a string identifier that uniquely
    represents this specific subgroup changed handler within the TrinityCore framework.
    This name is typically used for logging, debugging, or identifying the handler
    instance in system diagnostics. The method is const, indicating it does not modify
    any internal state of the handler object. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    group management system, this handler likely responds to events when a player's
    subgroup membership changes, such as when they are moved between raid subgroups
    or when a new member joins a group.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the unique name identifier of this subgroup changed
    handler instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SubgroupChangedHandler handler;

      std::string handlerName = handler.GetHandlerName();

      // handlerName now contains the string identifier for this handler'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently during group management operations,
    so it should have minimal performance overhead. The returned string is typically
    set during object construction or initialization and remains constant throughout
    the object's lifetime.
