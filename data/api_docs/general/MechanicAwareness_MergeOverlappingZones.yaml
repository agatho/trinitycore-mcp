  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: MergeOverlappingZones
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::MergeOverlappingZones()
documentation:
  brief: Merges overlapping zones within the MechanicAwareness system to prevent duplicate
    or conflicting mechanic detections.
  description: The MergeOverlappingZones method consolidates overlapping or intersecting
    zones in the MechanicAwareness system, ensuring that mechanics are not redundantly
    applied or incorrectly triggered due to zone overlaps. This method is typically
    invoked during zone initialization or when zone boundaries are dynamically modified.
    It helps maintain accurate mechanic detection and prevents performance issues
    caused by excessive or conflicting zone checks. The operation ensures that only
    one representative zone exists for each unique area, improving both accuracy and
    efficiency of the awareness system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Zone Initialization
    code: "void InitializeMechanicAwareness()\n{\n    MechanicAwareness awareness;\n\
      \    // ... setup zones ...\n    awareness.MergeOverlappingZones();\n    //\
      \ Zones are now merged and optimized\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after all zones have been defined but before
    the system is actively used. It performs a spatial analysis of zone boundaries
    to identify overlaps, which may introduce performance overhead during large-scale
    zone operations.
  warnings: Calling this method while active mechanics are being processed may lead
    to inconsistent behavior. Ensure all zones are fully defined and no active detection
    is occurring before invoking this function.
