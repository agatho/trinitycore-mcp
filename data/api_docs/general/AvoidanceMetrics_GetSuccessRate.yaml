  method: GetSuccessRate
  signature: float AvoidanceMetrics::GetSuccessRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the success rate of avoidance mechanics for a given
    combat encounter.
  description: The GetSuccessRate method computes the overall effectiveness of avoidance
    abilities such as dodge, parry, and miss chances for a unit during combat. This
    value represents the percentage chance that an attack will be avoided by the unit's
    defensive capabilities. The calculation typically takes into account base stats,
    gear modifiers, and any temporary buffs or debuffs affecting the unit's avoidance
    rating. The method is commonly used in combat simulation systems to determine
    the likelihood of successful evasion during damage calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the success rate of avoidance mechanics as a
    percentage (e.g., 0.25 represents 25% chance of avoiding an attack). Returns 0.0
    if no avoidance data is available or if the unit has no avoidance capabilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Calculation
    code: "float successRate = player->GetAvoidanceMetrics()->GetSuccessRate();\n\
      if (successRate > 0.5f) {\n    // Player has high avoidance, likely to dodge/parry\
      \ attacks\n    printf(\"High avoidance rate: %.2f%%\\n\", successRate * 100);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Avoidance Rate in Damage Reduction Logic
    code: "AvoidanceMetrics* metrics = unit->GetAvoidanceMetrics();\nfloat avoidanceRate\
      \ = metrics->GetSuccessRate();\nif (avoidanceRate > 0.0f) {\n    // Apply avoidance\
      \ logic to reduce incoming damage\n    float damageReduction = avoidanceRate\
      \ * 0.3f; // Example: 30% damage reduction per avoidance point\n    finalDamage\
      \ *= (1.0f - damageReduction);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may cache computed values for performance reasons and should
    be called sparingly in high-frequency combat loops. The result is typically updated
    whenever the unit's stats or equipment changes, but may not reflect real-time
    fluctuations during active combat.
  warnings: The returned value represents a theoretical maximum avoidance rate and
    does not account for diminishing returns or specific game mechanics like critical
    hit avoidance. In some cases, this value might be capped by game rules or server
    configurations.
