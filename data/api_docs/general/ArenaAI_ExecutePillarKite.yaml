  class: ArenaAI
  method: ExecutePillarKite
  signature: bool ArenaAI::ExecutePillarKite(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a pillar kite maneuver during arena combat, returning true if successful.
  description: The ExecutePillarKite method implements a tactical movement behavior
    for arena AI units, specifically designed to perform a 'kite' maneuver around
    an arena pillar. This technique allows the AI to maintain distance from the player
    while staying within the confines of the arena's layout, typically used to avoid
    melee attacks or to position for optimal ranged combat. The method evaluates the
    current positioning and movement state of the AI unit relative to the arena environment
    and attempts to execute a strategic retreat or positioning move. It requires the
    AI to be in an active arena match and must be called during combat situations
    where such tactical movements are beneficial.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's index or identifier
      within the arena context. This parameter is used to determine the target player
      for the kite maneuver and may influence positioning calculations.
  returns: Returns true if the pillar kite maneuver was successfully executed, otherwise
    returns false. The method may return false if preconditions such as valid player
    reference, proper arena state, or sufficient movement space are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat
    code: "if (arenaAI->ExecutePillarKite(&playerIndex)) {\n    // Successfully performed\
      \ pillar kite maneuver\n    // AI is now positioned strategically\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with conditional logic for arena AI
    code: "void ArenaCombatHandler(ArenaAI* ai, int* targetPlayer) {\n    if (ai->IsInArena()\
      \ && ai->GetHealthPercent() < 50) {\n        if (!ai->ExecutePillarKite(targetPlayer))\
      \ {\n            // Fallback to standard movement\n            ai->MoveToPosition();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the arena AI's tactical behavior system and should
    only be called during active combat within an arena environment. The method relies
    on internal arena layout data and may not function correctly outside of proper
    arena contexts. Performance-wise, this method performs minimal calculations but
    requires access to arena-specific positioning data.
  warnings: Calling ExecutePillarKite without a valid player reference or in non-arena
    environments may result in undefined behavior. The method assumes that the AI
    unit has sufficient movement capabilities and that the arena environment supports
    the requested maneuver.
