  brief: Saves the player's inventory and gold information to the database using the
    specified transaction.
  description: The SaveInventoryAndGoldToDB method persists the current state of a
    player's inventory items and gold amount to the database. This function is typically
    invoked during player logout, character saving, or when significant inventory
    changes occur. It ensures that all item stacks, their quantities, and the player's
    gold balance are accurately recorded in the game's persistent storage. The method
    utilizes a provided database transaction object to maintain data consistency across
    multiple related database operations.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Logout
    code: "void Player::OnLogout()\n{\n    SaveInventoryAndGoldToDB();\n    // Additional\
      \ logout logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Custom Transaction
    code: "void Player::SaveCharacterData(Transaction* trans)\n{\n    SaveInventoryAndGoldToDB(trans);\n\
      \    // Other save operations using same transaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player data persistence system in TrinityCore.
    It should only be called when database transactions are properly initialized and
    active. The method does not handle transaction commit or rollback; it assumes
    the caller manages these aspects.
  warnings: Calling this method without an active database transaction may result
    in undefined behavior or data corruption. Ensure that all related database operations
    use the same transaction context to maintain consistency.
