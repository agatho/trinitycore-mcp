  class: MawPower
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void MawPower::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner, const
    Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes the creation data for a MawPower object into a ByteBuffer for transmission
    to a player.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of a MawPower
    object into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for network transmission to a specific
    player. This method is typically used during object initialization or when sending
    updates about the MawPower's state to clients. The data written includes relevant
    fields that define the power's characteristics, such as its type, level, and any
    associated flags. It requires both an owner (the player who possesses the power)
    and a receiver (the player who will receive the data), ensuring proper targeting
    of the serialized information.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized MawPower creation
      data will be written. This buffer is used for network transmission to the client.
  - name: owner
    description: A pointer to the Player object who owns this MawPower. Used to determine
      ownership-related properties and state during serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object who will receive this MawPower data.
      Ensures correct targeting of the serialized information for the intended client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Object Initialization
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get player with MawPower

      Player* receiver = ...; // Target player

      MawPower power;

      power.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending MawPower Update to Client
    code: "ByteBuffer updateData;\nPlayer* owner = session->GetPlayer();\nPlayer*\
      \ target = ...; // Another player in range\nMawPower* power = owner->GetMawPower();\n\
      if (power)\n{\n    power->WriteCreate(updateData, owner, target);\n    session->SendPacket(&updateData);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's object serialization system and
    should be called only when preparing data for network transmission. The ByteBuffer
    must be properly initialized before calling this method, and both owner and receiver
    pointers must be valid to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not call WriteCreate without ensuring that the owner and receiver players
    are valid and in scope. Incorrect usage can lead to memory corruption or client-side
    desynchronization issues.
