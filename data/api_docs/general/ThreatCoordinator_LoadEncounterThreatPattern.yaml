  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: LoadEncounterThreatPattern
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::LoadEncounterThreatPattern(uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads the threat pattern for a specified encounter from the database.
  description: The LoadEncounterThreatPattern method initializes and loads the threat
    behavior configuration for a specific encounter ID. This method is typically invoked
    during encounter setup or initialization to ensure that the threat management
    system has the correct data for handling mob aggro and threat distribution. It
    retrieves predefined threat patterns from the database, which define how mobs
    should generate and respond to threat in the context of a particular encounter.
    The method does not return any value but modifies internal state within the ThreatCoordinator
    class.
  parameters:
  - name: encounterId
    description: The unique identifier of the encounter for which the threat pattern
      is to be loaded. This ID corresponds to entries in the database that define
      specific encounter behaviors and threat configurations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading Threat Pattern for an Encounter
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.LoadEncounterThreatPattern(12345); // Loads threat pattern for encounter
      ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called during the initialization phase of an
    encounter. It assumes that the database contains valid entries for the provided
    encounterId. The method may perform database queries and should ideally be called
    from a thread-safe context.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent encounterId may result
    in undefined behavior or missing threat data for the encounter. Ensure that all
    encounter IDs passed to this method are valid and correspond to existing entries
    in the database.
