documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of crafting reagent items that a player has in their
    inventory for depositing into a trade skill.
  description: This method retrieves the count of crafting reagent items that are
    available for depositing into a trade skill, typically used when performing crafting
    actions such as enchanting, engineering, or other trade skill activities. The
    method checks the player's inventory for items that match the required reagents
    for their current crafting skill and returns the total number of such items available.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with other crafting-related methods to determine
    how many items can be consumed during a crafting process. The returned value represents
    the quantity of items that can be deposited, which may vary based on the player's
    inventory and the specific trade skill being performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the total number of crafting reagent items
    available for deposit. A value of 0 indicates no suitable items are present in
    the inventory, while positive values indicate the count of items that can be used
    for crafting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int reagentsCount = player->GetCraftingReagentItemsToDeposit();\nif (reagentsCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with crafting\n}"

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other trade skill related
    methods to determine the availability of reagents for crafting. It may be affected
    by player's inventory limits and item restrictions based on trade skill requirements.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the items are actually usable for
    the current trade skill; it simply returns the count of items that match the criteria.
    Care should be taken to ensure that the returned value is used appropriately in
    crafting operations.
