  class: Unit
  method: RemoveVehicleKit
  signature: void Unit::RemoveVehicleKit(bool onRemoveFromWorld)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the vehicle kit from the unit and optionally removes it from the
    world.
  description: This method removes the vehicle kit associated with the unit, effectively
    disabling any vehicle-related mechanics for that unit. The method can be called
    with or without the onRemoveFromWorld parameter, which determines whether the
    vehicle should also be removed from the world. When called without the parameter,
    it only removes the vehicle kit internally, allowing the unit to continue existing
    in the world but without vehicle functionality. When called with the parameter
    set to true, it removes the vehicle from the world entirely, potentially causing
    the unit to despawn or become unavailable for vehicle interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->RemoveVehicleKit();'
    language: cpp
  - title: With World Removal
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->RemoveVehicleKit(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used during vehicle-related events such as when a
    player dismounts or when a vehicle is destroyed. It's important to note that this
    method does not destroy the vehicle object itself, but rather removes its kit
    from the unit, which may be used in conjunction with other methods like RemoveVehicleFromWorld.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent state in vehicle
    mechanics and potentially cause crashes if the vehicle is still referenced after
    removal. Care should be taken when calling this method during active vehicle interactions
    or events.
