documentation:
  brief: Searches for nearby formation members and updates the creature's formation
    data accordingly.
  description: This method performs a search for nearby creatures that belong to the
    same formation as the current creature. It is used primarily in the context of
    AI behavior where creatures may be part of a group or formation that needs to
    be maintained. The method will scan the surrounding area for other creatures that
    share the same formation, and update the creature's internal formation data based
    on these findings. This process helps maintain proper group dynamics and ensures
    that creatures behave according to their formation rules during combat or other
    interactions.

    combat. It may involve scanning the area for nearby creatures and updating formation
    data accordingly. Performance considerations include the number of creatures in
    the search area, which can affect execution time.
