  class: ThreatManager
  method: PutThreatenedByMeRef
  signature: void ThreatManager::PutThreatenedByMeRef(const int & guid, ThreatReference
    * ref)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a threat reference to the manager's list of entities threatened by this
    unit.
  description: The PutThreatenedByMeRef method is used to register a ThreatReference
    object within the ThreatManager, associating it with the current unit's threat
    list. This method is typically invoked when a creature or player begins to threaten
    another entity, establishing a relationship in the threat system. The method takes
    a GUID and a reference to a ThreatReference object, which contains information
    about the threat level and target. It ensures that the reference is properly linked
    within the manager's internal data structures for tracking threat relationships.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the entity being threatened.
      This value uniquely identifies the target within the game world.
  - name: ref
    description: A pointer to a ThreatReference object that holds the threat data
      for the specified GUID. The reference must be valid and not null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of PutThreatenedByMeRef
    code: 'ThreatReference* threatRef = new ThreatReference(targetGuid, 100.0f);

      threatManager.PutThreatenedByMeRef(targetGuid, threatRef);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the unit is actively threatening another
    entity. The ThreatReference object passed must be allocated and managed properly
    to avoid memory leaks or dangling pointers.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'ref' will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that all GUIDs are valid and that the ThreatReference objects
    are correctly initialized before calling this method.
