documentation:
  brief: Resets all movement validation statistics to their initial state.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears and reinitializes all internal counters
    and tracking data used by the MovementValidator class. This method is typically
    invoked when starting a new validation session or when it's necessary to clear
    accumulated statistics. The operation ensures that subsequent movement validations
    begin with clean state metrics, allowing for accurate measurement of movement
    behavior. No parameters are required as the method operates on the instance's
    internal state only.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Movement Statistics Before Validation
    code: 'MovementValidator validator;

      validator.ResetStatistics();

      // Now ready to perform new movement validation with clean stats'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating a new batch of movement validations
    to ensure accurate statistical reporting. It does not affect the validator's configuration
    or rules, only its internal counters.
