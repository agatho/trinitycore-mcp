documentation:
  brief: Updates the duel flag state for the player based on the current time.
  description: The UpdateDuelFlag method manages the internal state of a player's
    duel status, including handling the countdown timer and updating the duel flag
    display. This method is typically called periodically during game updates to ensure
    that duel-related flags and timers are properly maintained. It checks if the duel
    has expired or been accepted, and updates the player's duel status accordingly.
    The method operates on the provided current time value to determine whether any
    duel-related state changes should occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdatePlayers()\n{\n    time_t currentTime = time(nullptr);\n\
      \    for (auto& player : m_players)\n    {\n        player->UpdateDuelFlag(currentTime);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game update loop or by other
    internal systems that manage player state. It's important to note that this method
    does not directly send packets to clients; it only updates internal state. Client-side
    updates are usually handled separately through other mechanisms.
  warnings: Do not call this method with outdated time values as it may cause incorrect
    duel state transitions. The method assumes that the provided time is current and
    valid for determining duel expiration or acceptance.
