  brief: Resets the NPC interaction manager state to its initial condition
  description: The Reset method clears all active NPC interactions and resets the
    internal state of the NPCInteractionManager. This includes clearing any ongoing
    dialog sessions, resetting interaction counters, and releasing references to currently
    interacting NPCs. The method ensures that the manager returns to a clean state
    where no NPC interactions are in progress. This is typically called when an NPC
    interaction session ends or when the system needs to be reinitialized for a new
    set of interactions.

  notes: This method should be called carefully as it will terminate any active NPC
    interactions. It's recommended to verify that no important dialog states are currently
    in progress before invoking this method.
