  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: GenerateComparativeReport
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::GenerateComparativeReport(std::string & report,
    const std::vector<uint32_t> & botGuids) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a comparative performance report for AI decision-making across
    multiple bot instances.
  description: The GenerateComparativeReport method compiles and formats detailed
    performance metrics from AI decision profiling data collected across specified
    bot instances. It aggregates information about decision times, success rates,
    and other relevant AI behavior statistics to produce a structured report string.
    This functionality is primarily used for debugging, optimization, and analysis
    of AI performance in TrinityCore's bot system. The method requires a valid vector
    of bot GUIDs to retrieve profiling data from the AIDecisionProfiler instance.
  parameters:
  - name: report
    description: Reference to a string where the generated comparative report will
      be stored. The output format includes detailed performance metrics for each
      bot.
  - name: botGuids
    description: Vector of unique identifiers (GUIDs) representing the bot instances
      to include in the comparative analysis. Each GUID must correspond to an active
      bot with profiling data available.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::string report;

      std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      profiler.GenerateComparativeReport(report, botGuids);

      // The ''report'' string now contains the comparative analysis of AI decisions
      for bots with GUIDs 1001, 1002, and 1003.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Logging
    code: 'std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      std::string report;

      profiler.GenerateComparativeReport(report, botGuids);

      TC_LOG_INFO("ai.bot", "AI Decision Report:\n%s", report.c_str());

      // Logs the comparative report to the TrinityCore log system for further analysis.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that profiling data exists for all provided bot GUIDs.
    If any GUID does not correspond to an active or profiled bot, those entries may
    be skipped or result in incomplete reports. The report format is designed to be
    human-readable and includes timing information, decision counts, and success percentages.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot GUID vector contains only valid identifiers of bots
    currently under profiling. Passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead to undefined
    behavior or missing data in the generated report.
