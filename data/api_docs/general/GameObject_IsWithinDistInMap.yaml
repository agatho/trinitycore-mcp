  signature: bool GameObject::IsWithinDistInMap(const int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a GameObject is within distance limits of a player in
    the same map.
  description: This method checks if the GameObject is within the specified distance
    range from a player, considering only the same map. It evaluates the distance
    between the GameObject and player coordinates, returning true if the distance
    is less than or equal to the defined limit. The method is commonly used for determining
    proximity in game mechanics such as quest completion, interaction with NPCs, or
    triggering events based on distance. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper game logic and ensuring that players only interact with objects within
    their current map.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject is within the specified distance of the
    player in the same map; otherwise false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (gameObject->IsWithinDistInMap(player)) {\n    // Perform action when\
      \ player is nearby\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the same map distance calculation, meaning it does not consider
    different maps or instances. It's important to note that this method may be computationally
    expensive if used frequently in loops or during event handling, as it involves
    distance calculations between coordinates.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency scenarios, as it
    might impact performance if used with many objects. Also, ensure that the player
    object is valid and not null before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
