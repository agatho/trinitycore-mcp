  class: QuestEventBus
  method: GetSubscriberCount
  signature: uint32 QuestEventBus::GetSubscriberCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of subscribers currently registered with the quest
    event bus.
  description: The GetSubscriberCount method retrieves the current count of all active
    subscribers to the QuestEventBus. This count represents how many objects (typically
    quest handlers, event listeners, or systems) are currently subscribed to receive
    notifications about quest-related events. The method provides a read-only snapshot
    of the subscriber state at the time of invocation and is useful for debugging,
    monitoring system load, or determining the number of active quest event handlers
    in the game world. This count includes all types of subscribers regardless of
    their specific subscription type or event scope.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of subscribers currently registered
    with the QuestEventBus. Returns zero if no subscribers are registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Subscriber Count
    code: "uint32 subscriberCount = sQuestEventBus->GetSubscriberCount();\nif (subscriberCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"quest\", \"Active quest event subscribers: %u\"\
      , subscriberCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring System Load with Subscriber Count
    code: "void LogQuestEventBusStatus()\n{\n    uint32 count = sQuestEventBus->GetSubscriberCount();\n\
      \    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"quest\", \"QuestEventBus has %u subscribers\", count);\n\
      \    // Potentially trigger performance alerts if count is unusually high\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a thread-safe read operation on the subscriber registry.
    The returned count is consistent at the time of call but may change immediately
    after due to concurrent subscription/unsubscription operations. The implementation
    uses atomic operations or appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure data consistency.
  warnings: While this method is safe to call from any thread, frequent polling of
    subscriber counts can introduce performance overhead in high-frequency scenarios.
    Avoid calling this method excessively in performance-critical code paths.
