documentation:
  brief: Returns the lock date timestamp of the calendar event
  description: The GetLockDate method retrieves the lock date associated with a calendar
    event. In World of Warcraft's calendar system, events can be locked to prevent
    modifications after a certain point. This timestamp represents when the event
    was locked, if applicable. The returned value is a standard Unix timestamp (seconds
    since epoch) that indicates the date and time when the locking occurred. If the
    event has not been locked, this method typically returns 0 or a default value
    indicating no lock.
  parameters: []
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp of when the calendar event
    was locked. Returns 0 if the event is not locked or if no lock date has been set.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an event is locked
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    time_t lockDate = event->GetLockDate();\n    if (lockDate > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        // Event is locked\n        std::cout << \"Event locked on: \" << ctime(&lockDate);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Event is not locked\n        std::cout <<\
      \ \"Event is not locked\";\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with calendar event management
    systems to enforce modification restrictions. The lock date may be set automatically
    when an event reaches a certain status or when specific conditions are met within
    the game's calendar logic.
