  signature: bool GroupEvent::IsExpired() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a group event has expired based on its internal time tracking
    mechanism.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if a GroupEvent instance has exceeded
    its valid duration or scheduled end time. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to manage dynamic group activities such as raids, dungeons,
    or world events that have defined lifespans. It evaluates the event's internal
    timestamp against current system time and returns true if the event should no
    longer be active. The implementation likely relies on internal timers or cooldown
    systems managed by the GroupEvent class itself.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group event has expired (i.e., its duration has passed
    or end time has been reached), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check event status
    code: "if (groupEvent->IsExpired()) {\n    // Handle expired event logic\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Group event has expired.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional logic for event management
    code: "void UpdateGroupEvents() {\n    for (auto& event : groupEvents) {\n   \
      \     if (!event->IsExpired()) {\n            // Continue processing active\
      \ events\n            event->Update();\n        } else {\n            // Remove\
      \ expired event from list\n            event->RemoveFromGroup();\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during group update cycles and should
    have minimal performance impact. The expiration logic may be based on either absolute
    timestamps or relative durations depending on how the GroupEvent was initialized.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for critical event handling without
    additional validation, as timing discrepancies could occur in high-load server
    environments.
