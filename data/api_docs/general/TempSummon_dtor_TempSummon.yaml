documentation:
  brief: Destroys a temporary summon instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The TempSummon destructor is responsible for cleaning up all resources
    associated with a temporary summoned creature. This includes removing the summon
    from the world, releasing any allocated memory, and ensuring proper cleanup of
    the summon's internal state. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    temporary summons are creatures that are summoned for a limited duration or until
    certain conditions are met, such as when a spell is cast or a specific event occurs.
    The destructor ensures that these summons do not leave behind any dangling references
    or memory leaks when they expire or are dismissed.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of temporary summon
    code: "void SomeSpellEffect()\n{\n    TempSummon* summon = new TempSummon();\n\
      \    // ... summon logic ...\n    delete summon; // Triggers ~TempSummon()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a TempSummon object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this destructor
    may be called during world shutdown or when a summon is dismissed, so any cleanup
    performed should be safe in these contexts.
