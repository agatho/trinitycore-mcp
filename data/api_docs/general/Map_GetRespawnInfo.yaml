documentation:
  brief: Retrieves respawn information for objects in the map
  description: This method retrieves respawn data for objects within the map, allowing
    developers to access information about object respawn times and states. It is
    commonly used in conjunction with spawn type masks to filter specific object types.
    The method provides access to respawn-related data that can be crucial for managing
    object spawning and despawning in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: respawnData
    description: Reference to integer where respawn information will be stored. This
      parameter typically contains the respawn time or state information for objects.
  - name: types
    description: SpawnObjectTypeMask that specifies which type of objects to retrieve
      respawn data for. This parameter allows filtering based on object types such
      as gameobjects, creatures, or other spawn types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = GetMap();

      int respawnData;

      SpawnObjectTypeMask types = SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT;

      map->GetRespawnInfo(respawnData, types);'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely accesses internal respawn data
    structures within the map class. Performance considerations: The method may involve
    locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety when accessing shared respawn data.
    Thread safety: Access to respawn data should be handled carefully in multi-threaded
    environments.'
  warnings: 'Potential issues: This method may not return valid data if objects are
    not properly initialized or if the map has not been fully loaded. Common mistake:
    Using incorrect spawn type masks can lead to unexpected results or access violations.'
