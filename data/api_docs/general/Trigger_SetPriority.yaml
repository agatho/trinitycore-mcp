  class: Trigger
  method: SetPriority
  signature: void Trigger::SetPriority(uint32 priority)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the execution priority of the trigger.
  description: The SetPriority method configures the relative priority level of a
    trigger within the game's AI system. This determines the order in which triggers
    are evaluated and executed when multiple triggers are active. Higher priority
    triggers are processed before lower priority ones, allowing for more critical
    events to take precedence. The priority value is typically an unsigned 32-bit
    integer where larger values indicate higher priority. This method is commonly
    used in custom AI scripts or quest systems where event ordering is crucial for
    proper gameplay behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level to assign to this trigger. Higher values indicate
      higher priority. Valid range is typically 0 to UINT32_MAX, though practical
      usage often limits values to a reasonable range like 0-1000.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Trigger Priority in Quest Script
    code: 'Trigger* trigger = sObjectMgr->GetTrigger(12345);

      trigger->SetPriority(1000);

      // This trigger will now execute before others with lower priority'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Priority Adjustment Based on Game State
    code: "if (player->HasAura(SPELL_CRITICAL_AURA))\n{\n    trigger->SetPriority(5000);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    trigger->SetPriority(100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the trigger's position in the execution queue.
    Changes to priority take effect immediately and may impact other triggers that
    depend on execution order. The priority system is used internally by TrinityCore's
    AI framework for managing event processing.
  warnings: Setting extremely high priority values may cause unintended behavior if
    not properly balanced with other triggers. Ensure that priority assignments don't
    create circular dependencies or deadlock conditions in complex trigger chains.
