  class: KitingUtils
  method: WillKitingDisruptGroup
  signature: bool KitingUtils::WillKitingDisruptGroup(Player * bot, const int & kitingPos,
    const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether kiting a target will disrupt the bot's current group formation.
  description: The WillKitingDisruptGroup method evaluates if performing a kiting
    maneuver on a specified target at a given position would cause the bot to break
    its current group formation. This is typically used in AI logic to prevent actions
    that might lead to the bot becoming isolated or losing group cohesion during combat.
    The method takes into account the bot's current position, the kiting position
    relative to the target, and the group configuration to make this determination.
    It returns true if the kiting action would disrupt the group, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is performing
      the kiting action. Must not be null.
  - name: kitingPos
    description: Integer value representing the position or index of the kiting maneuver
      relative to the target. Used to determine the spatial relationship during kiting.
  - name: group
    description: Integer value representing the group identifier or formation index
      that the bot is currently part of. Used to evaluate group cohesion and disruption.
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether kiting would disrupt the group. Returns
    true if the action would cause group disruption, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (KitingUtils::WillKitingDisruptGroup(bot, 3, 1)) {\n    // Avoid kiting\
      \ to preserve group cohesion\n    bot->GetAI()->DoAction(AI_ACTION_AVOID_KITING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integrating with combat decision making
    code: "bool disruptsGroup = KitingUtils::WillKitingDisruptGroup(playerBot, kitingPosition,\
      \ currentGroup);\nif (!disruptsGroup && playerBot->GetTarget() != nullptr) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with kiting as it won't disrupt group\n    playerBot->CastSpell(playerBot->GetTarget(),\
      \ SPELL_KITING_MOVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in TrinityCore's AI systems for bots that follow
    group-based combat strategies. It assumes that the bot and its group members are
    within a defined spatial range for kiting to be considered disruptive. The implementation
    likely involves checking distance metrics, group member positions, and target
    positioning relative to the bot.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method, as passing
    a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, the kitingPos and group
    parameters should be within expected ranges to avoid incorrect evaluations.
