  class: LFGMgr
  method: GetLockedDungeons
  signature: LfgLockMap LFGMgr::GetLockedDungeons(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the set of locked dungeons for a specific player GUID.
  description: The GetLockedDungeons method returns a map containing all dungeon locks
    associated with a given player's GUID. This functionality is used within the LFG
    (Looking For Group) system to track which dungeons a player cannot enter due to
    various restrictions such as level requirements, completed quests, or other game
    mechanics. The returned LfgLockMap typically includes information about lock status,
    reason for locking, and associated dungeon IDs. This method plays a crucial role
    in preventing players from joining groups in dungeons they are not eligible to
    enter.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose locked dungeons
      are being retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: A LfgLockMap containing all dungeon locks for the specified player. Each
    entry in the map represents a dungeon that is currently locked for this player,
    including details about why it's locked and the lock status.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Locked Dungeons for Player
    code: "uint64 playerGuid = 123456789;\nLfgLockMap locks = sLFGMgr->GetLockedDungeons(playerGuid);\n\
      for (auto& lock : locks)\n{\n    uint32 dungeonId = lock.first;\n    LfgLockStatus\
      \ status = lock.second;\n    // Process each locked dungeon\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and relies on internal player state
    tracking. The returned map should not be modified directly as it's managed by
    the LFG manager. Performance is generally good for typical usage, but frequent
    calls may impact server performance if used excessively.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid player in the game
    world; invalid or non-player GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior. The returned
    map should be treated as read-only and not modified directly.
