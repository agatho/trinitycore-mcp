  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: GetBotEffectiveness
  signature: float PerformanceOptimizer::GetBotEffectiveness(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the effectiveness rating of a specific bot based on
    its performance metrics.
  description: The GetBotEffectiveness method retrieves the calculated effectiveness
    score for a given bot identified by its unique GUID. This score typically reflects
    how efficiently the bot is performing within the game environment, considering
    factors such as task completion rate, resource utilization, and overall contribution
    to server stability or gameplay objectives. The method is designed to provide
    a normalized float value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 represents optimal performance
    and 0.0 indicates complete inefficiency. It's commonly used in performance monitoring
    systems and AI behavior tuning within TrinityCore's bot management framework.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to calculate effectiveness.
      Must be a valid, registered bot GUID within the current session.
  returns: A float value representing the bot's effectiveness rating between 0.0 (inefficient)
    and 1.0 (optimal). Returns 0.0 if the bot is not found or has no performance data
    available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nfloat effectiveness = optimizer.GetBotEffectiveness(botGuid);\n\
      if (effectiveness > 0.8f)\n{\n    // Bot is performing well\n    printf(\"High\
      \ performance bot detected: %.2f\\n\", effectiveness);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Loop
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32_t guid\
      \ : botGuids)\n{\n    float eff = optimizer.GetBotEffectiveness(guid);\n   \
      \ if (eff < 0.5f)\n    {\n        // Trigger alert for low-performing bot\n\
      \        LOG_ERROR(\"ai\", \"Low effectiveness detected for bot %u: %.2f\",\
      \ guid, eff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that performance data has been previously collected and
    stored for the specified bot. The calculation may involve complex algorithms considering
    multiple performance indicators such as response time, task success rate, and
    resource consumption. This function is thread-safe when used with properly synchronized
    access to the PerformanceOptimizer instance.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered bot GUID will return
    0.0 without throwing an exception. Ensure that all bot GUIDs passed are valid
    before invoking this method to avoid incorrect performance assessments.
