    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the customization choices associated with a specific character
    customization option ID.
  description: The GetCustomiztionChoices method fetches an array of integer values
    representing available customization options for a given character customization
    option identifier. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's character creation
    and customization systems to determine what visual choices are valid for a particular
    aspect of character appearance, such as facial features, hair styles, or skin
    tones. The returned pointer points to an internal static array that should not
    be modified or freed by the caller. The method assumes the provided ID corresponds
    to a valid entry in the DB2 files used by TrinityCore's data system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointing to an array of integers representing the available
    customization choices for the specified option ID. Returns nullptr if no data
    is found for the given ID or if the internal lookup fails.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through customization choices
    code: "const int* choices = sDB2Manager->GetCustomiztionChoices(12345);\nif (choices\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10 && choices[i] != -1; ++i)\n   \
      \ {\n        printf(\"Choice %d: %d\\n\", i, choices[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures and caches. It is recommended
    to cache the result if the same customization option ID is accessed multiple times
    during a session. The returned array is null-terminated with -1, indicating the
    end of valid choices.
  warnings: The returned pointer points to an internal static buffer; do not attempt
    to free or modify its contents. Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical
    code paths as it may involve internal lookups or caching mechanisms.
