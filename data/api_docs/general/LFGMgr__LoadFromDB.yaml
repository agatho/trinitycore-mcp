  signature: void LFGMgr::_LoadFromDB(int * fields, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Loads LFG (Looking for Group) data from the database for a specific player
    GUID
  description: The _LoadFromDB method is an internal utility function within the LFGMgr
    class responsible for retrieving and initializing Looking for Group session data
    from the database. It processes database records associated with a given player
    identifier (GUID) to restore their LFG state, including queued groups, roles,
    and preferences. This method typically executes during player login or when LFG
    data needs to be refreshed from persistent storage. The function operates synchronously
    and is part of the internal data management system for the LFG subsystem.
  parameters:
  - name: fields
    description: Pointer to an array of database field values containing LFG session
      data for the player
  - name: guid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG data is being loaded
      from the database
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during player login
    code: "void Player::LoadLFGData()\n{\n    // Assume we have a database result\
      \ set with LFG fields\n    int fields[10];\n    uint32 playerGuid = GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    sLFGMgr->_LoadFromDB(fields, playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal implementation detail and should not be called
    directly by external code. It assumes the database connection is already established
    and that the fields array contains properly formatted data from a valid LFG record.
    The method may perform database queries internally to fetch additional related
    information.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or uninitialized field arrays as
    it may cause memory corruption or undefined behavior. This function must only
    be invoked when the player's session state is being restored, not during normal
    gameplay operations.
