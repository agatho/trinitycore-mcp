  class: RoleAssignment
  method: ExecuteStrictStrategy
  signature: void RoleAssignment::ExecuteStrictStrategy(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a strict role assignment strategy for a group, enforcing predefined
    role distributions based on player attributes and group composition.
  description: The ExecuteStrictStrategy method applies a deterministic role assignment
    algorithm to a specified group in TrinityCore. This function ensures that players
    within the group are assigned roles (such as tank, healer, or damage dealer) according
    to a strict set of rules defined by the game's role management system. The method
    analyzes player class, specialization, and other relevant attributes to distribute
    roles evenly and appropriately across the group. It is typically invoked during
    group creation or reorganization to maintain optimal team composition for dungeons,
    raids, or battlegrounds. This strategy enforces hard constraints on role distribution,
    meaning it will not assign a role if doing so would violate the strict rules of
    the assignment algorithm.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which the strict role assignment
      strategy will be executed. Must be a valid group instance with at least one
      member. The group must not be null or in an invalid state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Assignment Execution
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n \
      \   RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.ExecuteStrictStrategy(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Assignment with Error Handling
    code: "Group* group = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\nif (group && group->IsLeader(playerGuid))\n\
      {\n    RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.ExecuteStrictStrategy(group);\n\
      \    // Role assignments are now enforced for the group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the group by updating player roles.
    It should only be called when the group is stable and all members are present.
    The implementation may involve multiple iterations to achieve a valid role distribution,
    especially in larger groups. Performance impact is minimal for small groups but
    can increase with larger compositions due to the complexity of constraint solving.
  warnings: Calling this method on an empty or invalid group pointer will result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the group contains valid members before invoking
    this function. This method does not perform any validation of group leader status,
    so it should only be called by trusted code with proper authority checks.
