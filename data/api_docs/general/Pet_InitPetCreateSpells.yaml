documentation:
  brief: Initializes the spell list for a pet with its default create spells.
  description: The InitPetCreateSpells method sets up the initial set of spells that
    a pet will have available upon creation. This method is typically called during
    the pet's initialization phase to populate its spell book with innate abilities
    and learned spells based on the pet's type, level, and species. It ensures that
    pets start with the correct baseline spell repertoire required for their role
    in combat or support functions within the game world.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'Pet* myPet = new Pet();

      myPet->InitPetCreateSpells();

      // Pet now has its default spell list initialized'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during pet creation and should
    not typically be called manually unless resetting or reinitializing a pet's spell
    list. The implementation relies on internal data tables that define which spells
    are available to specific pet types.
