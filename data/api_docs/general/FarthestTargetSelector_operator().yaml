  method: operator()
  signature: bool FarthestTargetSelector::operator()(const Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a target unit is the farthest from the selector's owner
    within specified criteria.
  description: The FarthestTargetSelector::operator() method determines if a given
    Unit target is the farthest away from the selector's owner among all valid targets.
    This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes where the system
    needs to identify the most distant enemy or target for specific actions such as
    spell targeting, movement decisions, or tactical positioning. The evaluation considers
    various factors like line of sight, distance thresholds, and target validity.
    It returns true if the provided target meets the criteria of being the farthest,
    false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided target is the farthest from the selector's
    owner among valid targets; otherwise returns false.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "class MyAI\n{\npublic:\n    bool SelectFarthestTarget(Unit* owner, std::vector<Unit*>&\
      \ targets)\n    {\n        FarthestTargetSelector selector(owner);\n       \
      \ auto farthest = std::max_element(targets.begin(), targets.end(), selector);\n\
      \        return farthest != targets.end();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI framework for target selection
    logic. The implementation likely uses distance calculations and may consider factors
    like combat range, line of sight, and target validity. Performance can be impacted
    by the number of targets being evaluated.
