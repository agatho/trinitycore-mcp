  method: GetScriptName
  signature: const std::string & InstanceMap::GetScriptName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the script name associated with the instance map.
  description: The GetScriptName method retrieves the string identifier that corresponds
    to the script assigned to this instance map. This script name is typically used
    by the game engine to locate and initialize the appropriate script behavior for
    the map. The returned reference points to an internal string stored within the
    InstanceMap object, ensuring efficient access without unnecessary copying. This
    method is commonly invoked during map initialization or when scripts need to be
    dynamically loaded based on instance data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the script name assigned
    to this instance map. The string will be empty if no script has been assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log the script name of an instance map
    code: 'InstanceMap* map = ...; // Assume valid instance map

      const std::string& scriptName = map->GetScriptName();

      TC_LOG_INFO("script", "Instance map script: %s", scriptName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if an instance map has a specific script assigned
    code: "InstanceMap* map = ...;\nif (map->GetScriptName() == \"instance_example_map\"\
      ) {\n    // Perform actions specific to this scripted instance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference is valid only as long as the InstanceMap object
    remains alive. This method does not perform any dynamic allocation or copying,
    making it efficient for frequent calls. The script name is typically set during
    map creation or loading from database entries.
