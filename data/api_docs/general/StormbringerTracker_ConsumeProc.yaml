documentation:
  brief: Consumes a proc chance from the Stormbringer tracker, reducing its internal
    counter and triggering associated effects.
  description: The ConsumeProc method is responsible for handling the consumption
    of a proc chance within the StormbringerTracker class. This method typically reduces
    an internal counter or state that tracks available proc chances, and may trigger
    additional game mechanics such as applying damage, healing, or status effects.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with weapon procs or ability triggers where
    a limited number of successful procs can occur before the effect resets. The method
    does not accept parameters and performs its operation based on internal state
    management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: 'StormbringerTracker tracker;

      // Assume tracker has been initialized with proc chances

      tracker.ConsumeProc(); // Consumes one proc chance from the tracker'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system managing weapon or ability
    procs in TrinityCore. It should be called only when a proc condition has been
    met and validated. The internal state of the tracker must be properly initialized
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling ConsumeProc without verifying that a proc condition is met may
    result in incorrect gameplay behavior or unbalanced mechanics. Ensure proper synchronization
    if used in multi-threaded contexts.
