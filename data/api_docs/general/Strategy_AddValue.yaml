  class: Strategy
  method: AddValue
  signature: void Strategy::AddValue(const std::string & name, std::shared_ptr<Value>
    value)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a named value to the strategy's internal collection for use in AI decision-making.
  description: The AddValue method registers a shared pointer to a Value object with
    a specified name within the Strategy class. This allows the AI system to store
    and retrieve named data values that can influence behavior decisions. The method
    is typically used during strategy initialization or configuration to provide contextual
    data to the AI logic. Values added via this method are accessible through other
    strategy methods and can represent various game state information such as player
    attributes, environmental conditions, or tactical data.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for the value being added. This name is
      used to retrieve the value later within the strategy context.
  - name: value
    description: A shared pointer to a Value object containing the data to be stored.
      The Value object must be properly initialized and compatible with the strategy's
      expected data types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<Value> healthValue = std::make_shared<HealthValue>(unit);

      strategy->AddValue("target_health", healthValue);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Values
    code: 'strategy->AddValue("distance_to_target", std::make_shared<DistanceValue>(target));

      strategy->AddValue("threat_level", std::make_shared<ThreatValue>(unit));

      strategy->AddValue("mana_percentage", std::make_shared<ManaValue>(unit));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses shared_ptr for memory management, so the Value objects will
    be automatically cleaned up when no longer referenced. The strategy's internal
    storage mechanism should handle duplicate names gracefully, potentially overwriting
    existing values with the same name.
  warnings: Ensure that the Value objects passed to this method are properly initialized
    and compatible with the expected data types in the strategy. Passing null shared_ptr
    values may lead to undefined behavior or runtime errors.
