  signature: uint32 IBotResourceMonitor::GetActiveThreadCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current count of active threads managed by the bot resource
    monitor.
  description: The GetActiveThreadCount method returns the number of threads currently
    active within the bot resource monitoring system. This value represents the real-time
    thread utilization for bot operations, which is crucial for performance monitoring
    and resource management in TrinityCore's AI framework. The method provides a snapshot
    of how many concurrent threads are being used to process bot-related tasks, such
    as behavior execution, pathfinding, or decision-making algorithms. This information
    helps developers and administrators understand the system load and optimize bot
    performance accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of currently active threads managed
    by the IBotResourceMonitor instance. Returns zero if no threads are active or
    if the monitor is not initialized properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Thread Count Retrieval
    code: "uint32 activeThreads = botResourceMonitor->GetActiveThreadCount();\nif\
      \ (activeThreads > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Active threads: \" << activeThreads\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "void MonitorBotPerformance(IBotResourceMonitor* monitor)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ currentCount = monitor->GetActiveThreadCount();\n    if (currentCount > 10)\n\
      \    {\n        sLog->outError(\"High thread usage detected: %u threads active\"\
      , currentCount);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outInfo(\"Normal thread\
      \ usage: %u threads active\", currentCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for performance diagnostics and resource allocation
    decisions. The returned value may fluctuate dynamically as bot threads are created
    and destroyed during runtime operations. The implementation likely uses atomic
    operations or thread-safe counters to ensure accurate readings even in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: The returned thread count does not include idle or waiting threads, only
    those currently executing tasks. This method should not be called excessively
    in performance-critical sections as it may involve synchronization overhead. In
    high-frequency scenarios, consider caching the result rather than calling this
    method repeatedly.
