documentation:
  brief: Destroys an Action object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~Action destructor is automatically invoked when an Action object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of any dynamically allocated memory, release of system resources, and termination
    of any ongoing operations related to the action. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this typically involves cleaning up internal state, removing references
    from action queues, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. The destructor should
    be called implicitly by the C++ runtime and does not require manual invocation
    unless explicitly managing object lifetimes.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of Action object
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    Action* action = new Action();\n    // ... perform\
      \ actions ...\n    delete action; // Triggers ~Action destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-allocated Action destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction() {\n    Action action;\n    // ... use action ...\n\
      \    // ~Action called automatically when action goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is virtual in the base Action class, allowing proper cleanup
    of derived classes. It's important to ensure that all child classes properly implement
    their own destructors to avoid resource leaks. The destruction process should
    be thread-safe if the Action object might be accessed from multiple threads.
  warnings: Do not manually call the destructor unless you are explicitly managing
    object lifetime through placement new or similar techniques. Calling ~Action directly
    on stack-allocated objects can lead to undefined behavior.
