  brief: Updates the fire mage's active buffs and aura states based on current spell
    effects and combat conditions.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method manages the application, removal, and updating
    of all active buff effects for a fire mage character. This includes tracking spell
    auras, proc effects, temporary stat bonuses, and cooldown-related states that
    influence the mage's performance during combat. The method evaluates the current
    state of the player's buffs and applies necessary updates to maintain accurate
    game mechanics such as damage multipliers, movement speed increases, or resistance
    enhancements. It typically runs during each update cycle or when specific buff
    conditions are met, ensuring that all active effects are properly maintained according
    to their duration and triggering mechanisms.
