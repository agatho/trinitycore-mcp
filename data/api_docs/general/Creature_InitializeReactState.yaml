  signature: void Creature::InitializeReactState()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the creature's reaction state to its default values.
  description: The InitializeReactState method sets up the initial reaction state
    for a Creature object, typically called during creature creation or reset. This
    method configures how the creature will react to various stimuli such as player
    interactions, combat triggers, and environmental events. It establishes the baseline
    AI behavior state that determines whether the creature will be passive, defensive,
    or aggressive towards players and other creatures. The initialization process
    ensures that all reaction-related flags and states are properly set according
    to the creature's template settings and faction.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Creature Creation
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->InitializeReactState();

      // Creature is now initialized with default reaction state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Creature AI Reset Context
    code: "void ResetCreatureAI(Creature* creature)\n{\n    creature->ClearAllReactState();\n\
      \    creature->InitializeReactState();\n    // Reinitialize reaction state after\
      \ reset\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    creature object initialization. Developers should not normally need to call this
    method directly unless implementing custom AI behavior or resetting creature states.
    The method sets up internal flags that control reaction behavior, including faction-based
    reactions and combat readiness states.
  warnings: Calling InitializeReactState on a creature that is already in combat or
    actively engaged may cause unexpected behavior. This method should only be called
    when the creature state is stable and not actively processing AI decisions.
