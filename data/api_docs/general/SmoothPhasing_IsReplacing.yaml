  signature: bool SmoothPhasing::IsReplacing(ObjectGuid guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given object GUID is currently being replaced in smooth phasing.
  description: The IsReplacing method determines whether a specific object identified
    by its GUID is currently undergoing a replacement operation within the smooth
    phasing system. This functionality is crucial for managing object visibility transitions
    during phase changes in World of Warcraft, particularly when objects are being
    phased in or out. The method typically returns true if the object is in a transitional
    state where it's being replaced by another object in the phasing system, and false
    otherwise. This check is essential for preventing conflicts during phase updates
    and ensuring proper object visibility management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified object GUID is currently being replaced in
    the smooth phasing system, indicating a transitional phase state. Returns false
    if the object is not in a replacement state or if the GUID does not correspond
    to any tracked object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if an object is replacing
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);\nif (smoothPhasing->IsReplacing(guid))\
      \ {\n    // Handle the case where this player is currently being replaced\n\
      \    printf(\"Player is in replacement phase\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on internal tracking structures maintained by
    the SmoothPhasing system. It's important to note that the method may only return
    accurate results for objects that are actively tracked by the phasing system.
    The implementation might involve checking internal maps or lists of currently
    replacing objects.
