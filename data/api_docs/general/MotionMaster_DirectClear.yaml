  class: MotionMaster
  method: DirectClear
  signature: void MotionMaster::DirectClear(const std::function<bool (MovementGenerator
    *)> & filter)
documentation:
  brief: Clears all movement generators from the motion master, optionally filtering
    by a predicate function.
  description: The DirectClear method removes all movement generators currently active
    in the MotionMaster instance. It optionally accepts a filter function that determines
    which movement generators should be cleared. This method is typically used during
    state transitions or when resetting an object's movement behavior. The operation
    directly modifies the internal list of movement generators without triggering
    any cleanup callbacks or additional logic beyond the removal itself. This is a
    low-level utility function intended for internal use within the AI and movement
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: filter
    description: A std::function<bool(MovementGenerator*)> that takes a pointer to
      a MovementGenerator and returns true if it should be cleared. If the filter
      is empty or null, all movement generators are cleared.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear All Movement Generators
    code: motionMaster.DirectClear([](MovementGenerator* mg) { return true; });
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear Only Specific Type of Movement Generator
    code: "motionMaster.DirectClear([](MovementGenerator* mg) {\n    return mg->GetType()\
      \ == IDLE_MOTION_TYPE;\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct removal from the internal movement generator
    list. It does not call any destructor or cleanup logic on the generators themselves,
    so care must be taken if those operations are required. The filter function is
    evaluated for each movement generator in the list before removal.
  warnings: Using this method without proper understanding of the movement system
    can lead to inconsistent AI behavior or memory leaks if cleanup routines are not
    manually invoked. Avoid calling this during active movement processing as it may
    invalidate iterators.
