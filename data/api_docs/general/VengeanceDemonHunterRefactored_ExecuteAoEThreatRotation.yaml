  method: ExecuteAoEThreatRotation
  signature: void VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::ExecuteAoEThreatRotation(int * target,
    uint32 enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Vengeance Demon Hunter's AoE threat rotation logic for targeting
    multiple enemies.
  description: The ExecuteAoEThreatRotation method implements the core logic for a
    Vengeance Demon Hunter's ability to manage and execute threat-generating abilities
    in an area-of-effect scenario. This method is typically invoked during combat
    situations where multiple enemy targets are present, and it determines which abilities
    should be used based on current threat levels, available resources, and enemy
    positioning. The method modifies the target list and executes appropriate spells
    or abilities to maintain optimal threat distribution among enemies while adhering
    to class-specific mechanics such as fury management, cooldown tracking, and ability
    prioritization.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current primary target index
      in the combat environment. This value may be modified by the method during execution.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the total number of enemies currently
      within the AoE threat zone. Used to determine rotation priority and ability
      usage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: 'int primaryTarget = 0;

      uint32 numEnemies = 5;

      player->GetAI()->ExecuteAoEThreatRotation(&primaryTarget, numEnemies);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom AI Logic
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        uint32 enemyCount = me->GetMap()->GetPlayersCountExceptGMs();\n\
      \        int targetIndex = 0;\n        ExecuteAoEThreatRotation(&targetIndex,\
      \ enemyCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI is already initialized and has access to
    valid combat state information. The target pointer may be updated during execution
    to reflect the most optimal threat target based on current rotation logic.
  warnings: Ensure that enemyCount is accurately calculated before calling this method,
    as incorrect values can lead to improper ability selection or resource management
    issues in the Vengeance Demon Hunter's rotation.
