  class: DPSPositioning
  method: EvaluateDPSPositions
  signature: int DPSPositioning::EvaluateDPSPositions(const int & candidates, Player
    * dps, const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the optimal positioning for a DPS player based on combat
    context.
  description: The EvaluateDPSPositions method determines the best positional strategy
    for a Damage Per Second (DPS) player within a given combat scenario. It analyzes
    various factors such as enemy proximity, terrain, line of sight, and player abilities
    to calculate an optimal position that maximizes damage output while maintaining
    survivability. The method takes into account the current combat context provided
    by the CombatPositionContext parameter and returns a numerical score representing
    the quality of the evaluated positions. This function is typically used in AI-driven
    positioning systems or tactical decision-making modules within TrinityCore's combat
    engine.
  parameters:
  - name: candidates
    description: An integer representing the number of candidate positions to evaluate
      for optimal DPS placement. This value determines how many potential locations
      will be considered during the evaluation process.
  - name: dps
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the DPS character whose
      positioning is being evaluated. The method uses this player's current state,
      abilities, and attributes to determine optimal positioning.
  - name: context
    description: A constant reference to a CombatPositionContext structure that provides
      contextual information about the current combat situation, including enemy positions,
      terrain data, and other relevant environmental factors affecting positioning
      decisions.
  returns: An integer value representing the evaluation score of the determined optimal
    DPS position. Higher values typically indicate better positioning for maximizing
    damage output while maintaining safety. A negative return may indicate an invalid
    or suboptimal positioning scenario.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int result = dpsPositioning.EvaluateDPSPositions(5, player, combatContext);\n\
      if (result > 0) {\n    // Positioning is optimal\n    // Proceed with attack\
      \ or movement\n} else {\n    // Consider alternative positioning\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Position Adjustment
    code: "CombatPositionContext context;\ncontext.enemyPositions = GetEnemyPositions();\n\
      context.terrainData = GetTerrainInfo();\ncontext.playerState = player->GetPlayerState();\n\
      \nint optimalScore = dpsPositioning.EvaluateDPSPositions(10, player, context);\n\
      if (optimalScore > 80) {\n    // Execute high-damage positioning strategy\n\
      \    player->SetPosition(GetOptimalPosition(context));\n} else if (optimalScore\
      \ > 40) {\n    // Adjust to safer but still effective position\n    player->MoveToSafePosition();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use in AI-driven combat positioning
    systems. It may perform computationally intensive calculations depending on the
    number of candidates and complexity of the combat context. The method assumes
    that all input parameters are valid and properly initialized. Performance can
    be affected by high candidate counts or complex terrain data.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as it will likely cause a crash if passed an invalid reference. The CombatPositionContext
    must contain valid data for accurate positioning evaluation; otherwise, results
    may be meaningless or misleading.
