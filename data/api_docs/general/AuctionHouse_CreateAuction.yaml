    stackCount, uint32 bid, uint32 buyout, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new auction entry in the auction house system for a specified item.
  description: The CreateAuction method is responsible for generating a new auction
    listing within the auction house system. It takes parameters including the player's
    identifier, item GUID, stack count, bid amount, buyout price, and auction duration
    to construct and store the auction record. This method ensures that all necessary
    validations are performed before creating the auction, such as checking if the
    item belongs to the player and verifying valid pricing and duration values. The
    auction will appear in the auction house interface for other players to view and
    bid on.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player's unique identifier (GUID) who is creating
      the auction. Must point to a valid player object within the game world.
  - name: itemGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier of the item being auctioned. This
      must correspond to an existing item in the player's inventory or bank.
  - name: stackCount
    description: Number of items in the stack being auctioned. Must be a positive
      integer and cannot exceed the item's maximum stack size.
  - name: bid
    description: Minimum bid amount required to participate in the auction. Should
      be a valid gold value, typically 0 for no minimum bid.
  - name: buyout
    description: The fixed price at which the item can be purchased immediately without
      bidding. Must be greater than or equal to the bid amount and cannot exceed maximum
      allowed buyout values.
  - name: duration
    description: Duration of the auction in seconds. Valid durations are typically
      1 hour (3600), 2 hours (7200), or 4 hours (14400).
  returns: Returns true if the auction was successfully created and stored in the
    database, false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid parameters, insufficient
    permissions, or item ownership issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Creation
    code: "uint32 itemGuid = 12345;\nuint32 stackCount = 1;\nuint32 bid = 0;\nuint32\
      \ buyout = 100000;\nuint32 duration = 3600;\nint playerGuid = 67890;\nbool success\
      \ = auctionHouse->CreateAuction(&playerGuid, itemGuid, stackCount, bid, buyout,\
      \ duration);\nif (success) {\n    // Auction created successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating an Auction with Bid and Buyout
    code: "uint32 itemGuid = 54321;\nuint32 stackCount = 5;\nuint32 bid = 5000;\n\
      uint32 buyout = 25000;\nuint32 duration = 7200;\nint playerGuid = 98765;\nbool\
      \ success = auctionHouse->CreateAuction(&playerGuid, itemGuid, stackCount, bid,\
      \ buyout, duration);\nif (success) {\n    // Auction created with minimum bid\
      \ and buyout\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal validation checks including item ownership
    verification, stack size limits, and price consistency. It also updates the auction
    house database and may trigger notifications to other players in the vicinity
    or online. The method is typically called from within player interaction handlers
    when a user attempts to list an item for auction.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of input parameters can
    lead to invalid auction entries or database corruption. Ensure that the player
    GUID points to a valid online character, and that the item exists in their inventory
    before calling this function. Also note that creating auctions with extremely
    high buyout prices may be restricted by server configuration.
