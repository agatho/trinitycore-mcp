  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: RecordCombatAction
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::RecordCombatAction(Player * player, uint32_t
    spellId, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Records a combat action performed by a player, including spell usage and
    target information, for pattern recognition purposes.
  description: The RecordCombatAction method logs combat-related data for a given
    player, specifically capturing the spell ID used and the target unit involved
    in the action. This functionality is typically employed within TrinityCore's combat
    system to track player behavior, detect patterns, or enforce anti-cheat measures.
    The method does not return any value but updates internal tracking structures
    that may be used later for analysis or enforcement. It requires valid pointers
    to both the player and the target unit, and assumes proper initialization of the
    PlayerPatternRecognition system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object performing the combat action. Must not
      be null and must represent a valid player instance in the game world.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast. This value should
      correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is the target of the combat action.
      Must not be null and must represent a valid unit (player or creature) in the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: PlayerPatternRecognition::RecordCombatAction(player, 12345, targetUnit);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with spell and target validation
    code: "if (player && target && spellId > 0)\n{\n    PlayerPatternRecognition::RecordCombatAction(player,\
      \ spellId, target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger anti-cheat or behavior analysis system.
    It should be called during combat events when actions are confirmed to occur.
    Ensure that player and target pointers are valid before calling this function
    to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with null or invalid pointers can lead to crashes
    or unexpected behavior. Always validate input parameters before invoking the method.
    This method may have performance implications if called excessively during high-frequency
    combat events.
