  method: PolicyNetwork
  signature: void PolicyNetwork::PolicyNetwork(size_t stateSize, size_t actionSize)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a policy network with specified state and action dimensions for
    reinforcement learning applications.
  description: The PolicyNetwork constructor initializes a neural network used for
    policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning scenarios within the TrinityCore
    environment. This method sets up the internal structure of the policy network
    based on the provided state size and action size parameters, which define the
    input and output dimensions respectively. The initialized network is typically
    used by AI systems to determine optimal actions given current game states. This
    constructor should be called before any training or inference operations are performed
    on the policy network.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Policy Network Initialization
    code: 'PolicyNetwork agent(10, 4);

      // Initializes a policy network with 10-dimensional state space and 4-dimensional
      action space'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely allocates memory for neural network weights and biases
    based on the provided dimensions. The actual implementation details may involve
    initializing specific layers like fully connected layers or using predefined architectures
    suitable for game AI applications in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that stateSize and actionSize are positive integers greater than
    zero. Invalid dimensions may lead to undefined behavior or runtime errors during
    network operations.
