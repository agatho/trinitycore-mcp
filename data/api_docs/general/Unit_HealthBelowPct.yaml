  signature: bool Unit::HealthBelowPct(int32 pct) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit's health falls below a specified percentage.
  description: This method evaluates whether the current health level of a Unit object
    is below the given percentage threshold. It is commonly used in AI scripts to
    determine when a unit should trigger certain behaviors, such as entering combat
    or performing specific actions based on health status. The method returns true
    if the unit's health is less than or equal to the specified percentage, false
    otherwise. This functionality is essential for implementing conditional logic
    in creature AI systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit's health is below the specified percentage, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->HealthBelowPct(30)) {\n    // Perform action when health drops\
      \ below 30%\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a direct comparison of current health against the specified
    percentage without any additional calculations or conversions. It is important
    to note that this method does not account for temporary health changes or buffs,
    and only considers the actual current health value.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in AI scripts as it may lead to incorrect
    behavior if used with inappropriate percentage values. Ensure that the percentage
    value is appropriate for the intended use case, especially when dealing with different
    types of units (player vs. creature).
