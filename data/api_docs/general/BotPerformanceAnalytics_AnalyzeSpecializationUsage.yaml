  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: AnalyzeSpecializationUsage
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::AnalyzeSpecializationUsage(uint32_t botGuid,
    BotPerformanceProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and records specialization usage data for a bot based on its GUID
    and performance profile.
  description: The AnalyzeSpecializationUsage method processes performance data associated
    with a specific bot identified by its GUID. It evaluates the bot's specialization
    usage patterns, such as ability selection, talent deployment, and role adherence,
    within the context of World of Warcraft's combat mechanics. This method updates
    the provided BotPerformanceProfile with detailed analytics about how effectively
    the bot utilizes its chosen specialization. The analysis considers factors like
    spell casting efficiency, resource management, and tactical decision-making during
    gameplay. This functionality is typically used in automated bot performance evaluation
    systems to optimize AI behavior and improve overall bot effectiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose specialization usage is
      being analyzed. Must be a valid bot GUID within the TrinityCore system.
  - name: profile
    description: Reference to a BotPerformanceProfile object that will be updated
      with specialization usage analytics. The profile must be initialized before
      calling this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotPerformanceProfile profile;

      botAnalytics.AnalyzeSpecializationUsage(botGuid, profile);

      // Profile now contains specialization usage data for bot with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = GetBotGUID();\nif (botGuid != 0) {\n    BotPerformanceProfile\
      \ profile;\n    botAnalytics.AnalyzeSpecializationUsage(botGuid, profile);\n\
      \    // Process the analyzed data\n    LogSpecializationReport(profile);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Handle invalid GUID case\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid bot\
      \ GUID provided for specialization analysis\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot with the specified GUID exists in the system
    and has been properly initialized. The performance profile should be cleared or
    reset before calling this method to avoid data contamination. This method may
    have performance implications when processing large numbers of bots simultaneously,
    as it involves detailed analysis of combat behavior patterns.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotPerformanceProfile reference is valid and properly
    initialized before passing it to this method. Passing an uninitialized or corrupted
    profile could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method does not validate
    whether the bot GUID corresponds to an actual active bot in the game world.
