  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: GetSegmentGrowthRate
  signature: float MarketAnalysis::GetSegmentGrowthRate(MarketSegment segment)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the growth rate percentage for a specified market
    segment.
  description: The GetSegmentGrowthRate method computes the relative growth rate of
    a given market segment within the game's economy. This value represents how quickly
    demand or activity is increasing in that particular segment, which can be used
    for economic modeling, player decision-making, or AI-driven market predictions.
    The method takes a MarketSegment enumeration value as input and returns a floating-point
    number representing the percentage growth rate. It may utilize internal market
    data tracking systems to determine this value based on historical trends and current
    activity levels.
  parameters:
  - name: segment
    description: The MarketSegment enumeration value identifying which segment's growth
      rate should be calculated. Valid values are typically defined by the game's
      market system and may include categories such as weapons, armor, consumables,
      trade goods, or services.
  returns: A float value representing the percentage growth rate of the specified
    market segment. Positive values indicate increasing demand or activity, while
    negative values suggest declining trends. The value is typically expressed as
    a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5% growth). Returns zero if no data is available for
    the given segment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float growthRate = marketAnalysis.GetSegmentGrowthRate(MarketSegment::WEAPONS);\n\
      if (growthRate > 0.0f)\n{\n    printf(\"Weapon market is growing at %.2f%%\\\
      n\", growthRate * 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Multiple Segments
    code: "MarketSegment segments[] = { MarketSegment::ARMOR, MarketSegment::CONSUMABLES,\
      \ MarketSegment::TRADE_GOODS };\nfor (auto segment : segments)\n{\n    float\
      \ rate = marketAnalysis.GetSegmentGrowthRate(segment);\n    printf(\"%s growth\
      \ rate: %.2f%%\\n\", GetSegmentName(segment), rate * 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses cached or computed market data that may be updated
    periodically. It is recommended to cache the results if multiple calls are made
    within a short time frame. The implementation might involve complex economic models
    and could potentially include smoothing algorithms to prevent sudden fluctuations
    in reported growth rates.
  warnings: Ensure that the MarketSegment parameter passed is valid, as invalid values
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect calculations. This method should not
    be called during critical game operations where performance is paramount due to
    potential data processing overhead.
