api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateGroupRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateGroupRequirements(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets all group requirements for a specified quest.
  description: The ValidateGroupRequirements method checks if the given player satisfies
    all necessary group conditions required to accept or complete a specific quest.
    This includes verifying that the player is in a valid group state, has the appropriate
    group size, and meets any faction or level-based group restrictions imposed by
    the quest. The method ensures that game mechanics such as quest gating and group-based
    rewards are properly enforced within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate group requirements
      for. Must correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose group
      requirements are being validated. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if all group requirements for the specified quest are met
    by the player; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateGroupRequirements(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can proceed with quest\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Player does not meet group requirements\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the group requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Group Validation
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nPlayer* bot = player;\nif (QuestValidation::ValidateGroupRequirements(questId,\
      \ bot)) {\n    // Proceed with quest logic\n    if (bot->GetGroup()) {\n   \
      \     // Ensure all group members meet requirements\n        for (GroupReference*\
      \ ref = bot->GetGroup()->GetFirstMember(); ref; ref = ref->next()) {\n     \
      \       Player* member = ref->getSource();\n            if (!QuestValidation::ValidateGroupRequirements(questId,\
      \ member)) {\n                bot->SendNotification(\"One or more group members\
      \ do not meet requirements.\");\n                return;\n            }\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n    // All validations passed\n    bot->CompleteQuest(questId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest data and group state information. It
    performs checks against the player's current group membership, group size, and
    faction alignment as defined in the quest template. The method does not modify
    any game state but only evaluates conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'bot' parameter is a valid Player pointer before calling
    this function to avoid null pointer exceptions. Also note that this validation
    may fail if the player is not currently in a group when the quest requires one,
    or if the group composition doesn't meet specific quest criteria.
