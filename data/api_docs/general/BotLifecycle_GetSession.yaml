  class: BotLifecycle
  method: GetSession
  signature: BotSession * BotLifecycle::GetSession() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bot session associated with the current lifecycle instance.
  description: The GetSession method returns a pointer to the BotSession object that
    is currently associated with this BotLifecycle instance. This session contains
    all relevant state information and context for the bot's operation within the
    TrinityCore environment. The method provides access to session-specific data such
    as player data, behavior configurations, and communication channels. It is typically
    used by bot logic components to retrieve session context when performing actions
    or making decisions. The returned pointer may be null if no session has been initialized
    for this lifecycle instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotSession object associated with this lifecycle, or nullptr
    if no session exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Retrieval
    code: "BotSession* session = botLifecycle->GetSession();\nif (session != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Use the session data\n    uint32 playerId = session->GetPlayerGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Session Access with Null Check
    code: "BotSession* session = botLifecycle->GetSession();\nif (session && session->IsInitialized())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with session-based operations\n    session->UpdateBehavior();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle uninitialized or missing session\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\"\
      , \"Bot session not available for lifecycle\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot execution cycles to access session
    data. The returned BotSession pointer should be validated before use, as it may
    be null if the session has not yet been created or has been destroyed. This method
    does not create or initialize sessions; it only retrieves existing ones.
  warnings: Always check for null return values when using this method. Accessing
    a null session pointer will result in undefined behavior and likely crash the
    application. Ensure that any session access is properly synchronized if used in
    multi-threaded contexts.
