  class: InterruptManager
  method: AnalyzeCastingSpell
  signature: void InterruptManager::AnalyzeCastingSpell(Unit * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes a casting spell to determine if it should be interrupted based on
    various conditions.
  description: The AnalyzeCastingSpell method evaluates whether a currently casting
    spell by the specified unit should be interrupted. It checks for interruptible
    spells, applies relevant interrupt rules, and potentially triggers spell interruption
    logic. This method is typically invoked during combat or when certain events occur
    that may affect spell casting. The analysis considers factors such as the caster's
    state, spell properties, and potential interrupt sources like damage or movement.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the caster whose spell is
      being analyzed for interruption. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat event handler
    code: "void OnDamageTaken(Unit* attacker, uint32 damage) {\n    if (Player* player\
      \ = caster->ToPlayer()) {\n        InterruptManager::AnalyzeCastingSpell(caster);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in spell interrupt logic
    code: "void HandleSpellInterrupt(Unit* target) {\n    if (target && target->IsInCombat())\
      \ {\n        InterruptManager::AnalyzeCastingSpell(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell interruption system in TrinityCore.
    It may be called from various game events such as damage taken, movement, or other
    combat-related triggers. The implementation likely involves checking spell state,
    interrupt flags, and caster status to determine if an interruption should occur.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method modifies internal spell states and should only be called in appropriate
    contexts where spell interruption logic is required.
