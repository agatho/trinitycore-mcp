  brief: Initializes and calibrates AI behavior settings for a bot based on its current
    level
  description: The CalibrateForLevel method adjusts various AI parameters and behaviors
    of a bot to match its current character level. This includes recalibrating skill
    levels, spell usage probabilities, combat tactics, and decision-making thresholds.
    The method ensures that bots at different levels behave appropriately within the
    game's difficulty scaling system. It typically gets called during bot initialization
    or when a bot levels up, ensuring that the AI adapts to the increased capabilities
    and responsibilities of higher-level characters.

    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.CalibrateForLevel();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal AI state variables and may trigger recalculations
    of bot behavior trees or decision matrices. It's typically called automatically
    during bot creation or level-up events, but can also be invoked manually to force
    recalibration.
