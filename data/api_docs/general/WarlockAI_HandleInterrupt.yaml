  class: WarlockAI
  method: HandleInterrupt
  signature: bool WarlockAI::HandleInterrupt(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the target unit's current spell casting if applicable.
  description: The HandleInterrupt method attempts to interrupt the spell casting
    of a specified target unit. This is commonly used in Warlock AI behavior to break
    enemy spell casts, particularly during combat situations. The method evaluates
    whether the target is currently casting a spell and applies appropriate interrupt
    mechanics based on the Warlock's abilities and the target's casting state. It
    returns true if the interruption was successful, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being interrupted. Must be a valid
      unit in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the target's spell casting was successfully interrupted,
    false if the interruption failed or was not applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Usage
    code: "if (warlockAI->HandleInterrupt(targetUnit)) {\n    // Spell was interrupted\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"world\", \"Spell interrupted on target {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupt with Conditional Logic
    code: "if (targetUnit && targetUnit->IsCasting()) {\n    if (warlockAI->HandleInterrupt(targetUnit))\
      \ {\n        // Perform additional actions after successful interrupt\n    \
      \    warlockAI->CastSpell(targetUnit, SPELL_SHADOW_WORD_PAIN);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI decision-making logic where Warlocks
    need to respond dynamically to enemy spell casts. It relies on the underlying
    TrinityCore spell system for determining cast status and applying interrupt effects.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method
    to prevent crashes. The method may not work correctly if called on units that
    are not currently casting spells.
