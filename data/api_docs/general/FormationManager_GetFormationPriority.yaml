  signature: uint32 FormationManager::GetFormationPriority() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the priority value used for formation management within the AI
    system.
  description: The GetFormationPriority method returns a uint32 value that represents
    the priority level assigned to a unit's formation behavior. This priority determines
    how the unit interacts with other units in a formation, influencing decisions
    such as positioning, movement coordination, and tactical behavior. The returned
    value is typically used internally by the FormationManager to sort and process
    units according to their formation priorities during group actions or combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the formation priority of the unit. Higher
    values generally indicate higher priority in formation handling, though exact
    semantics may depend on implementation details within the AI subsystem.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 priority = unit->GetFormationManager()->GetFormationPriority();\n\
      if (priority > 100)\n{\n    // Handle high-priority formation unit\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making processes where
    formation behavior needs to be evaluated. The priority value should remain consistent
    throughout the lifetime of a unit's formation membership unless explicitly changed
    by other methods.
