  signature: TeleportLocation & Player::GetTeleportDest()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the teleport destination location for the player.
  description: This method retrieves the current teleport destination location for
    a player, which represents the coordinates and map where the player will be teleported
    to upon using a teleport spell or similar mechanism. The returned TeleportLocation
    object contains the map ID, X, Y, Z coordinates, and orientation of the destination.
    This is commonly used in conjunction with teleportation mechanics such as those
    found in the World of Warcraft client or TrinityCore's core systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to a TeleportLocation object that contains the map
    ID, X, Y, Z coordinates, and orientation of the destination. This reference can
    be used to modify or access the teleport destination information directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'TeleportLocation dest = player->GetTeleportDest();

      float x = dest.coord_x;

      float y = dest.coord_y;

      float z = dest.coord_z;

      int mapId = dest.map_id;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "TeleportLocation &dest = player->GetTeleportDest();\nif (dest.map_id >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Perform teleportation logic\n    player->TeleportTo(dest.map_id,\
      \ dest.coord_x, dest.coord_y, dest.coord_z, dest.orientation);\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // Handle invalid destination case\n    // This could happen if player\
      \ hasn't been teleported yet\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within teleportation-related functions and
    may be called during various gameplay events such as when a player uses a teleport
    spell or when they are being teleported to a specific location. The returned reference
    should be handled carefully as it points to internal data structures that may
    change during gameplay.
  warnings: Be careful when modifying the returned TeleportLocation object, as changes
    might affect the player's teleportation behavior and could lead to unexpected
    results if not properly handled. Also note that this method returns a reference,
    so modifications to the returned value will directly affect the player's teleport
    destination.
