  class: Map
  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: std::string Map::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information about the map including instance ID, player count,
    and other relevant details.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method provides comprehensive debugging information
    about the current map instance. This includes details such as the instance ID,
    number of players currently on the map, and other relevant game state information.
    The method is primarily used for debugging purposes during development and testing
    phases, allowing developers to quickly assess the current state of a map instance
    without having to manually check multiple variables or perform complex queries.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a formatted string containing debug information about the map,
    including instance ID, player count, and other relevant details. The string format
    is typically structured to provide quick visual inspection of map status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Info Usage
    code: 'Map* map = GetMap();

      std::string debugInfo = map->GetDebugInfo();

      printf("Map Debug Info: %s\n", debugInfo.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging purposes and should not be
    used in production code. The returned string format may vary depending on the
    map type and instance state. Performance impact is minimal as it only reads existing
    data structures.
  warnings: This method should not be called during critical gameplay loops as it
    may cause performance issues if used excessively. Also, the debug information
    returned might not be thread-safe in multi-threaded environments.
