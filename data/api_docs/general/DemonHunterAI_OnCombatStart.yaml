  signature: void DemonHunterAI::OnCombatStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat behavior for a Demon Hunter AI unit when entering combat.
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a Demon Hunter AI unit enters
    combat mode. This method typically sets up initial combat state, initializes target
    tracking, and may trigger specific abilities or behaviors based on the demon hunter's
    class mechanics. It serves as the entry point for combat-related logic within
    the Demon Hunter AI system, ensuring proper initialization before engaging enemies.
    The method is called automatically by the TrinityCore framework when combat begins
    for this AI unit type.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Start Handling
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::OnCombatStart(int* target)\n{\n    // Initialize combat\
      \ variables\n    m_isInCombat = true;\n    m_target = target;\n    \n    //\
      \ Trigger initial abilities or actions\n    if (m_target)\n        DoCast(m_target,\
      \ SPELL_DEMON_BLADE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI framework in TrinityCore and should
    not be overridden unless custom combat behavior is required. The target parameter
    may be null if no valid target exists at the time of combat start.
  warnings: Ensure that any combat initialization logic within this method does not
    cause performance bottlenecks, as it's called frequently during combat entry.
    Avoid blocking operations or heavy computations in this method.
