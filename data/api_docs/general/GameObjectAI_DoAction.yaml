  class: GameObjectAI
  method: DoAction
  signature: void GameObjectAI::DoAction(int32 param)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a custom action defined by the game object's AI with the provided
    parameter.
  description: The DoAction method is a virtual function in the GameObjectAI class
    that allows game objects to respond to specific actions or events. It serves as
    an interface for custom AI behavior implementation, where the parameter 'param'
    typically represents a unique identifier or action code that determines how the
    AI should react. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore to trigger special
    behaviors, activate mechanisms, or change states within game object interactions.
    The method does not return any value and is intended to be overridden by derived
    classes to implement specific logic.
  parameters:
  - name: param
    description: An integer parameter that defines the action to be executed. This
      value is typically used as an identifier to determine which specific behavior
      or state change should occur within the AI implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom GameObjectAI implementation
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    MyGameObjectAI(GameObject*\
      \ go) : GameObjectAI(go) {}\n    \n    void DoAction(int32 param) override\n\
      \    {\n        switch (param)\n        {\n            case 1:\n           \
      \     // Activate special effect\n                break;\n            case 2:\n\
      \                // Trigger event\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  - title: Calling DoAction from another AI method
    code: "void MyGameObjectAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (m_events.Empty())\n\
      \    {\n        DoAction(1); // Trigger action with parameter 1\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The DoAction method is designed to be overridden in derived classes. It's
    important to ensure that the parameter values passed are within expected ranges
    or defined action codes to avoid undefined behavior. The method should not perform
    heavy computations as it may be called frequently during game updates.
  warnings: Do not call DoAction directly on base GameObjectAI instances without proper
    override implementation, as it will result in no-op behavior. Ensure that all
    derived classes properly handle the parameter values to prevent unexpected AI
    behavior or crashes.
