  brief: Kicks a player from the channel by name
  description: The Channel::Kick method removes a specified player from the channel.
    It takes the player who is performing the kick and the name of the player to be
    kicked as parameters. The method verifies that the kicker has sufficient permissions
    to remove players from the channel before executing the kick operation. This functionality
    is typically used in guild channels or custom channels where administrators need
    to manage membership.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is attempting to kick another player
      from the channel. Must be a valid player with appropriate permissions.
  - name: badname
    description: String containing the name of the player to be kicked from the channel.
      The name must match an existing player in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Channel Kick Usage
    code: "void HandleKickCommand(Player* player, const std::string& targetName)\n\
      {\n    Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"Guild1\", player);\n   \
      \ if (channel)\n    {\n        channel->Kick(player, targetName);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player performing the kick has sufficient privileges
    to remove members from the channel. The implementation likely checks for channel
    ownership or moderator status before allowing the kick operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter is valid and not null, as passing an
    invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, verify that the target
    player name exists in the game world to avoid silent failures.
