  class: BotSpawnerFactory
  method: ShouldUseLegacySpawner
  signature: bool BotSpawnerFactory::ShouldUseLegacySpawner()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the legacy bot spawner should be used instead of the modern
    one.
  description: This method evaluates internal configuration settings and runtime conditions
    to decide if the legacy bot spawner logic should be activated. It is typically
    used in environments where backward compatibility or specific legacy behavior
    is required. The decision may depend on features like deprecated spawn mechanics,
    older AI behaviors, or system configurations that have not been updated to support
    newer spawner implementations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the legacy spawner logic should be used; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check Legacy Spawner Usage
    code: "if (BotSpawnerFactory::ShouldUseLegacySpawner()) {\n    // Use legacy bot\
      \ spawning logic\n    legacySpawnManager->SpawnBots();\n} else {\n    // Use\
      \ modern bot spawning logic\n    modernSpawnManager->SpawnBots();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method might be influenced by server configuration flags or runtime
    environment variables. It is recommended to test this method's behavior in different
    environments to ensure correct spawner selection.
