  class: LOSCache
  method: InvalidateRegion
  signature: void LOSCache::InvalidateRegion(const int & center, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Invalidates all line-of-sight cache entries within a specified region centered
    on a given point.
  description: The InvalidateRegion method clears cached line-of-sight data for all
    entries located within a circular area defined by a center point and radius. This
    is typically used when game objects in the world change their position or state,
    such as when doors open or walls are destroyed, which could affect visibility
    between players and other entities. The method ensures that subsequent LOS checks
    will recalculate visibility rather than using stale cached data. It operates on
    a region-based cache invalidation system to efficiently manage memory and performance.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the region to invalidate, represented as an integer
      identifier (likely a grid cell or spatial hash). This value determines where
      the circular area for invalidation is centered.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular region in which to invalidate LOS cache
      entries. All cached entries within this distance from the center point will
      be removed from the cache.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Invalidating a Region Around a Door
    code: LOSCache::Instance()->InvalidateRegion(12345, 5.0f); // Invalidate LOS cache
      within 5 units of grid cell 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Invalidating a Larger Area After Map Change
    code: LOSCache::Instance()->InvalidateRegion(98765, 20.0f); // Invalidate LOS
      cache within 20 units of grid cell 98765
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a spatial caching system designed to optimize line-of-sight
    calculations in large-scale game worlds. It's important that the center parameter
    corresponds to a valid spatial identifier used by the LOS cache implementation.
    The radius should be carefully chosen to balance performance and accuracy, as
    larger radii invalidate more data but reduce recalculation overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method with an excessively large radius may cause performance
    degradation due to invalidating too many cache entries at once. Ensure that the
    center parameter is a valid spatial identifier; otherwise, the operation might
    not target the intended area.
