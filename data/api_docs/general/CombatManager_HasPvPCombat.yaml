documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has active PvP combat status.
  description: The HasPvPCombat method determines whether the player is currently
    engaged in Player versus Player (PvP) combat. This method evaluates the player's
    current combat state and returns true if they are in PvP combat, false otherwise.
    The check typically considers factors such as whether the player has recently
    damaged or been damaged by another player, and whether the combat flag is active.
    This functionality is essential for determining eligibility for certain PvP-related
    mechanics, such as entering contested areas or triggering PvP timers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in PvP combat, false if not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic PvP Combat Check
    code: "if (player->GetCombatManager()->HasPvPCombat()) {\n    // Player is in\
      \ PvP combat\n    player->SendNotification(\"You are currently in PvP combat.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Player is not in PvP combat\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You are not in PvP combat.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal combat state tracking and may consider recent
    damage events, combat flags, and other PvP-related conditions. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific TrinityCore version and patch.
