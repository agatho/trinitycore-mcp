  class: RBACData
  method: GrantPermission
  signature: RBACCommandResult RBACData::GrantPermission(uint32 permissionId, int32
    realmId)
documentation:
  brief: Grants a specified permission to the RBAC data for a given realm.
  description: The GrantPermission method assigns a specific permission ID to the
    RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) data structure for a particular realm. This method
    is used in TrinityCore's authentication and authorization system to define what
    actions a user or account can perform within the game world. The permission is
    associated with a specific realm ID, allowing fine-grained control over access
    rights across different realms or instances. The method returns an RBACCommandResult
    indicating success or failure of the operation.
  parameters:
  - name: permissionId
    description: The unique identifier of the permission to grant. This value corresponds
      to a defined permission in the RBAC system, typically mapped to specific commands
      or actions within the game.
  - name: realmId
    description: The identifier of the realm to which the permission should be granted.
      A value of -1 indicates that the permission applies globally across all realms.
  returns: Returns an RBACCommandResult enum value indicating whether the permission
    grant operation succeeded or failed. Possible values may include RBAC_RESULT_SUCCESS,
    RBAC_RESULT_ERROR_INVALID_PERMISSION, RBAC_RESULT_ERROR_INVALID_REALM, or other
    error codes depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Grant a permission for a specific realm
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      RBACCommandResult result = rbacData.GrantPermission(1001, 1); // Grant permission
      ID 1001 to realm 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Grant a global permission across all realms
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      RBACCommandResult result = rbacData.GrantPermission(2005, -1); // Grant global
      permission ID 2005'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during account management or administrative
    operations where permissions need to be dynamically assigned. The RBAC system
    in TrinityCore relies on these granular permissions to enforce access control
    for commands, features, and game functionalities. Ensure that the permission ID
    exists in the database before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid permissionId or realmId may result
    in a failed operation without throwing an exception. Always validate inputs before
    invoking this method. Be cautious when granting global permissions (-1) as they
    affect all realms and can have widespread security implications.
