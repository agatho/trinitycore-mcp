  class: Corpse
  method: SetOwnerGUID
  signature: void Corpse::SetOwnerGUID(int owner)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the player who owns this corpse.
  description: The SetOwnerGUID method assigns the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    player who owns the corpse. This is typically used when a player dies and their
    corpse is created, linking it to the player's GUID for proper identification and
    retrieval. The method updates internal tracking within the Corpse object to associate
    it with the specified owner. This is essential for corpse management in World
    of Warcraft, particularly for resurrection mechanics and loot distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: The GUID of the player who owns this corpse. This should be a valid
      player GUID value that uniquely identifies the character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Owner GUID for a Corpse
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = new Corpse();

      Player* player = ...; // Get reference to player

      corpse->SetOwnerGUID(player->GetGUID());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the Corpse object. It
    is typically called during corpse creation or when transferring ownership of a
    corpse, such as in cases of corpse looting or resurrection by another player.
