  class: FollowMovementGenerator
  method: Update
  signature: bool FollowMovementGenerator::Update(Unit * param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the follow movement generator to control a unit's movement behavior
    while following another unit.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing the movement logic of
    a unit that is following another unit. It calculates the necessary adjustments
    to maintain the follow distance and position, handling pathfinding and movement
    updates in real-time. This method is typically called during each update tick
    of the game loop to ensure smooth and accurate following behavior. The method
    returns true if the movement was successfully updated, or false if the follow
    behavior should be terminated.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is performing the follow movement.
      This represents the unit that will move in accordance with the follow behavior.
  - name: param1
    description: Integer value representing the update time delta in milliseconds.
      This parameter determines how much time has passed since the last update, used
      for calculating movement speed and positioning adjustments.
  returns: Returns true if the follow movement was successfully updated and the unit
    is still following; returns false if the follow behavior should be stopped (e.g.,
    target is out of range or lost).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement update loop
    code: "if (!followGenerator->Update(targetUnit, deltaTime)) {\n    // Stop following\
      \ behavior\n    followGenerator->Reset();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI update system
    code: "void AIUpdate(Unit* owner, uint32 diff) {\n    if (owner->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == FOLLOW_MOTION_TYPE) {\n        FollowMovementGenerator* followGen = static_cast<FollowMovementGenerator*>(\n\
      \            owner->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n   \
      \     if (!followGen->Update(owner, diff)) {\n            owner->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the target unit's position and movement data to calculate
    proper following behavior. It may trigger pathfinding calculations if the target
    moves out of the current follow range or if obstacles are encountered. The update
    frequency should be consistent with the game tick rate for optimal performance.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the internal state
    management of the movement generator. Improper usage can lead to units following
    incorrectly or getting stuck in invalid positions. Ensure that the target unit
    pointer is valid before calling this method.
