  class: GroupFormation
  method: IsFormationValid
  signature: bool GroupFormation::IsFormationValid() const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the group formation is correctly structured and meets all
    required conditions for proper group functionality.
  description: The IsFormationValid method checks if the current group formation adheres
    to all necessary rules and constraints for a valid group state in TrinityCore.
    This includes verifying that all group members are properly connected, that the
    group leader is valid, and that no structural inconsistencies exist within the
    group's formation. The method ensures that the group can function correctly in
    gameplay scenarios such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds where proper group
    structure is essential. It performs internal validation checks without modifying
    any group state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group formation is valid and all structural requirements
    are met; returns false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates
    issues such as missing group members, invalid group leader, or inconsistent group
    state that would prevent proper group operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "if (group->IsFormationValid()) {\n    // Proceed with group operations\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Group formation is valid\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid formation\n    sLog->outString(\"Group formation is invalid\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management
    code: "void Player::HandleGroupFormationCheck() {\n    Group* group = GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (!group) return;\n    \n    if (group->IsFormationValid()) {\n     \
      \   // All good, continue with group activities\n        SendGroupList();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Attempt to fix or notify user\n        group->RemoveMember(GetGUID());\n\
      \        SendGroupRemoved();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal validation checks that may involve iterating
    through group members and verifying their connection status. It's typically called
    before critical group operations to ensure structural integrity. The method is
    read-only and does not modify the group state.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for security purposes as it only validates
    formation structure, not member permissions or eligibility. Always perform additional
    validation when necessary for sensitive operations like raid creation or instance
    entry.
