  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetPointParams
  signature: const PointMovementParams & MovementRequest::GetPointParams() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the point movement parameters associated with this movement request.
  description: The GetPointParams method provides access to the PointMovementParams
    structure that contains all relevant data for a point-based movement request.
    This includes the target position, speed, and other movement-related properties.
    The returned reference is constant, meaning the parameters should not be modified
    through this interface. This method is typically used by AI systems or movement
    handlers to retrieve movement configuration before executing or processing a pathfinding
    operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the PointMovementParams structure that holds all
    parameters for point-based movement, including target coordinates, speed settings,
    and movement flags.

    code: "class CustomAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (movementRequest)\n        {\n            const\
      \ PointMovementParams& params = movementRequest->GetPointParams();\n       \
      \     // Use params to determine target position or speed\n            float\
      \ x = params.m_targetX;\n            float y = params.m_targetY;\n         \
      \   float z = params.m_targetZ;\n            // Process movement based on these\
      \ parameters\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference is valid only as long as the MovementRequest object
    itself remains alive. This method does not perform any validation or copying of
    data, so it's important to ensure that the underlying MovementRequest object isn't
    destroyed while the reference is in use.
