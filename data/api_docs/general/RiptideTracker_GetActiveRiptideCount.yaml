documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active Riptide effects on the player
  description: The GetActiveRiptideCount method retrieves the number of currently
    active Riptide spells applied to the player. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, Riptide is a healing spell that can be cast by Enhancement Shamans.
    This method tracks how many instances of the Riptide buff are currently active
    on the player, which is important for calculating healing over time effects and
    managing spell interactions. The returned count reflects the total number of Riptide
    ticks that will occur in the future, including any overlapping or refreshed applications
    of the spell.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of active Riptide effects currently
    applied to the player. This count includes all overlapping or refreshed instances
    of the Riptide spell that are still active and will generate healing ticks in
    the future.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check active Riptides
    code: "uint32 riptideCount = player->GetRiptideTracker()->GetActiveRiptideCount();\n\
      if (riptideCount > 0)\n{\n    // Player has active Riptide effects\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      You have %u active Riptide effects.\", riptideCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using count to determine healing potential
    code: "RiptideTracker* tracker = player->GetRiptideTracker();\nuint32 activeCount\
      \ = tracker->GetActiveRiptideCount();\nif (activeCount > 0)\n{\n    // Calculate\
      \ total healing from all active Riptides\n    float totalHealing = activeCount\
      \ * baseRiptideHealingPerTick;\n    player->AddExtraAttackerDamage(totalHealing);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other Riptide tracking
    functionality to manage spell stacking, healing calculations, and cooldown management.
    The count returned may include both the original Riptide application and any refreshed
    or extended versions of the spell that have occurred within the same tick window.
  warnings: Be aware that this count includes all active Riptide effects regardless
    of their individual durations or sources. When implementing logic based on this
    value, ensure proper handling of overlapping applications to avoid double-counting
    healing contributions or incorrect cooldown calculations.
