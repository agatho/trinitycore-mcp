  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void BotSpawnOrchestrator::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Gracefully shuts down the bot spawn orchestrator, cleaning up all active
    bot instances and releasing associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing bot spawning operations
    within the BotSpawnOrchestrator class. It ensures that any currently active bots
    are properly disposed of, their memory is released, and all internal state is
    reset. This method is typically invoked during server shutdown or when the bot
    system needs to be temporarily disabled. The shutdown process is designed to be
    thread-safe and will not leave any dangling references or zombie processes. It
    should only be called when no other operations are actively using the orchestrator.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnOrchestrator* orchestrator = BotSpawnOrchestrator::GetInstance();

      orchestrator->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that no other threads are actively using the orchestrator
    during shutdown. It is recommended to stop all bot-related activities before calling
    this method to avoid potential race conditions or undefined behavior.
