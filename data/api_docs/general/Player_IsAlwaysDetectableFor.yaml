  signature: bool Player::IsAlwaysDetectableFor(const int * seer) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is always detectable for a specific seer.
  description: This method checks if a player is always detectable for a given seer,
    meaning the player's visibility status will not change based on detection conditions.
    It typically returns true when the player is in a state where they are always
    visible to the specified seer regardless of game mechanics or detection rules.
    This method is commonly used in player detection logic and can be important for
    determining player visibility in various game scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: Pointer to the seer object that determines the detection context.
      This parameter represents the entity that will observe the player's detectability
      status.
  returns: Returns true if the player is always detectable for the specified seer,
    false otherwise. The method may return false in cases where detection rules apply
    or when the player is not visible to the seer.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Seer* seer = GetSeer();

      bool isAlwaysDetectable = player->IsAlwaysDetectableFor(&seer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method likely involves checking
    player's visibility state against detection rules, and may be used in conjunction
    with other detection methods. Performance considerations include potential overhead
    when checking multiple seers or players.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with regular detection methods; it
    specifically checks for always detectable status which is different from normal
    detection behavior. Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction
    with other visibility-related methods.
