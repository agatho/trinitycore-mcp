  class: WarbandSceneEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int WarbandSceneEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bitmask associated with the warband scene entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags configured for this WarbandSceneEntry. These flags typically define various
    behavioral or visual properties of the warband scene, such as whether it is enabled,
    visible, or has specific interaction modes. The returned value can be used in
    combination with bitwise operations to check individual flag states. This method
    does not modify any internal state and is safe for repeated calls. It is commonly
    used within the context of World of Warcraft's warband system to determine how
    a particular scene should behave during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flag bitmask for this warband scene
    entry. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific flag, allowing bitwise
    checks to determine individual flag states.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific flag is set
    code: "WarbandSceneEntry* entry = sWarbandSceneMgr->GetSceneEntry(12345);\nif\
      \ (entry && (entry->GetFlags() & 0x01))\n{\n    // Flag 0x01 is set, indicating\
      \ special behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combine flags for conditional logic
    code: "int flags = entry->GetFlags();\nif ((flags & (WARBAND_SCENE_FLAG_ENABLED\
      \ | WARBAND_SCENE_FLAG_VISIBLE)) == (WARBAND_SCENE_FLAG_ENABLED | WARBAND_SCENE_FLAG_VISIBLE))\n\
      {\n    // Both enabled and visible flags are set\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flag values are defined by the game's internal constants and may vary
    between different versions of TrinityCore. Developers should refer to the relevant
    header files or database schema for accurate flag definitions. This method is
    read-only and does not perform any locking operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the WarbandSceneEntry pointer is valid before calling this
    method, as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Bitwise
    operations on the returned integer should be performed carefully to avoid unintended
    masking or shifting errors.
