  class: CollectionMgr
  method: LoadTransmogIllusions
  signature: void CollectionMgr::LoadTransmogIllusions()
documentation:
  brief: Loads transmogrification illusions data from the database into memory for
    use in the collection manager.
  description: The LoadTransmogIllusions method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures of the CollectionMgr class with transmogrification illusion information
    retrieved from the database. This method is typically invoked during server startup
    or when reloading collection data to ensure that all available transmogrification
    illusions are properly loaded and accessible for player use. It handles the retrieval
    of illusion IDs, associated item templates, and any related metadata necessary
    for the transmogrification system to function correctly. The method performs database
    queries to fetch illusion records and processes them into an in-memory cache for
    efficient lookup during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = sCollectionMgr;\n\
      \    collectionMgr->LoadTransmogIllusions();\n    // Transmog illusions are\
      \ now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the relevant tables contain valid data. It's designed to be thread-safe, but
    calling it from multiple threads simultaneously may cause race conditions. The
    method does not return any error codes; failures during loading are typically
    logged internally.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper cleanup can lead to memory
    leaks or duplicate entries in the internal caches. Ensure that this method is
    only called once per server session unless explicitly designed for reloading.
