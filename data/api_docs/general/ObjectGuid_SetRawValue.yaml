  class: ObjectGuid
  method: SetRawValue
  signature: void ObjectGuid::SetRawValue(uint64 high, uint64 low)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the raw 64-bit high and low values of the ObjectGuid.
  description: The SetRawValue method assigns new high and low 64-bit values to the
    ObjectGuid object, effectively reconstructing the full 128-bit GUID from its constituent
    parts. This method is typically used when working with raw GUID data from database
    entries or network packets where the GUID is split into two 64-bit components.
    The method directly modifies the internal state of the ObjectGuid instance without
    performing any validation on the input values, so callers must ensure that the
    provided values are appropriate for the intended use case. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore implementation, ObjectGuids are used extensively to uniquely identify
    game objects, players, creatures, and other entities within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: high
    description: The upper 64 bits of the 128-bit GUID value. This typically represents
      the type-specific portion or server identifier of the GUID.
  - name: low
    description: The lower 64 bits of the 128-bit GUID value. This usually contains
      the unique instance identifier or object index within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a GUID from database values
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid;

      guid.SetRawValue(0x0000000000001234ULL, 0x56789ABCDEF00000ULL);

      // Resulting GUID combines high and low parts into a full 128-bit value'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reconstructing a player GUID from network data
    code: 'uint64 serverId = 12345;

      uint64 objectId = 67890;

      ObjectGuid playerGuid;

      playerGuid.SetRawValue(serverId, objectId);

      // playerGuid now represents a valid player identifier for TrinityCore'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs no validation of the input values. It is the caller's
    responsibility to ensure that the provided high and low values form a meaningful
    GUID for the intended context. The ObjectGuid class in TrinityCore uses a 128-bit
    internal representation, so this method directly sets both components without
    any conversion or normalization.
  warnings: Using invalid or malformed high/low values may result in unexpected behavior
    when the GUID is used in game logic. Be cautious when setting these values from
    external sources like database queries or network packets where data integrity
    cannot be guaranteed.
