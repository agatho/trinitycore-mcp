  class: BotAI
  method: ProcessQuestProgress
  signature: void BotAI::ProcessQuestProgress(const QuestEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Processes quest progress events for bot AI, updating quest states and handling
    quest-related actions.
  description: The ProcessQuestProgress method in the BotAI class handles quest-related
    events by evaluating the current state of quests assigned to the bot. It updates
    internal quest tracking data structures, manages quest completion conditions,
    and triggers appropriate responses such as quest submission or reward collection.
    This method is typically invoked when a quest event occurs within the game world
    that affects the bot's active quests. The method ensures that bots maintain accurate
    quest progress and respond appropriately to quest-related triggers without requiring
    manual intervention from players.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A constant reference to a QuestEvent object containing information
      about the quest event that occurred, including quest ID, progress updates, and
      completion status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ProcessQuestProgress
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnQuestEvent(const QuestEvent& event)\n{\n    ProcessQuestProgress(event);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling quest progress with conditional logic
    code: "void BotAI::ProcessQuestProgress(const QuestEvent& event)\n{\n    if (event.IsQuestComplete())\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle quest completion\n        CompleteQuest(event.GetQuestId());\n\
      \    }\n    else if (event.HasProgressUpdate())\n    {\n        // Update quest\
      \ progress\n        UpdateQuestProgress(event.GetQuestId(), event.GetProgress());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI processing loop and should be called regularly
    to ensure accurate quest tracking. It relies on proper initialization of quest
    data structures and assumes that the bot has valid quest assignments. The method
    may trigger additional internal callbacks related to quest completion or progress
    updates.
  warnings: Improper handling of QuestEvent objects can lead to incorrect quest state
    tracking. Ensure that all quest events are properly validated before passing them
    to this method. Avoid calling this method from multiple threads simultaneously
    without proper synchronization.
