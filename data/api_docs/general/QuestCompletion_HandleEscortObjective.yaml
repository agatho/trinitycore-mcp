  class: QuestCompletion
  method: HandleEscortObjective
  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleEscortObjective(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Processes quest escort objectives for a player bot, handling completion and
    reward distribution.
  description: The HandleEscortObjective method is responsible for managing the logic
    associated with escort quest objectives within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method typically handles the progression of quests where the player must escort
    an NPC to a specific location or complete certain conditions while maintaining
    the escort. It ensures that when an escort objective is completed, appropriate
    rewards are distributed and quest progress is updated accordingly. The method
    operates within the context of AI-driven bot behavior, specifically for quest
    completion scenarios involving escorted NPCs. This function is part of the broader
    QuestCompletion system and integrates with the game's quest tracking and reward
    mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is completing
      the escort objective. Must be a valid player instance with active quest data.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to QuestObjectiveData containing the specific escort objective
      details. This includes target location, NPC information, and completion criteria
      for the escort quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Escort Objective Completion
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player

      QuestObjectiveData objective;

      objective.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_ESCORT;

      objective.targetId = 12345;

      objective.location = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f);

      questCompletion.HandleEscortObjective(bot, objective);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Escort Objective with Reward Distribution
    code: 'Player* bot = ...;

      QuestObjectiveData objective;

      objective.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_ESCORT;

      objective.targetId = 12345;

      objective.location = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f);

      objective.rewardItems.push_back({45678, 1});

      questCompletion.HandleEscortObjective(bot, objective);

      // Quest progress updated and rewards distributed automatically'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player has an active escort quest in progress.
    The method internally handles quest state updates, reward distribution, and objective
    completion tracking. It's designed to be called from AI systems handling quest
    progression for bots. The method does not perform any direct database operations
    but relies on existing quest management systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player is properly initialized with valid quest data
    before calling this method. Passing an invalid or uninitialized Player pointer
    may result in undefined behavior. The objective data must contain valid target
    information and location coordinates for proper escort handling.
