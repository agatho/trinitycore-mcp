  method: SwitchToOptimalAspect
  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::SwitchToOptimalAspect()
documentation:
  brief: Switches the hunter to the most optimal aspect based on current combat situation
    and player state.
  description: The SwitchToOptimalAspect method determines and applies the best available
    aspect for a Survival Hunter in the current game context. This includes evaluating
    factors such as player health, target threat level, available mana, and active
    buffs/debuffs to select the most beneficial aspect from the hunter's arsenal.
    The method ensures that the hunter is always utilizing the most effective aspect
    for their current tactical needs, enhancing survivability or damage output depending
    on the situation. It typically involves checking if an aspect is already active,
    comparing the benefits of different aspects, and applying the chosen one through
    the TrinityCore API.

    code: "void MySurvivalHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        // Switch to optimal aspect when in combat\n        _hunter->SwitchToOptimalAspect();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's spell system and AI decision-making
    framework. It may be called automatically by the AI system or manually during
    specific combat scenarios. The selection logic should consider current player
    stats, cooldowns, and combat state to make an informed decision.
