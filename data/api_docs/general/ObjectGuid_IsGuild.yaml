documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a guild entity.
  description: The IsGuild method checks if the current ObjectGuid instance corresponds
    to a guild object within the TrinityCore framework. This method evaluates the
    type portion of the GUID to determine if it matches the guild identifier type.
    In World of Warcraft's architecture, each game object has a unique identifier
    that includes both a type and a counter component. Guilds are assigned a specific
    type value within this system, and this method returns true when the GUID's type
    matches that assigned to guilds. The check is performed purely on the GUID's internal
    structure without requiring database lookups or network calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a guild entity; otherwise returns
    false. This indicates whether the GUID's type field corresponds to the predefined
    guild type constant used internally by TrinityCore.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild GUID Check
    code: "ObjectGuid guildGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Guild>(12345);\nif\
      \ (guildGuid.IsGuild()) {\n    printf(\"This GUID represents a guild\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"This GUID does not represent a guild\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple GUID Types
    code: 'ObjectGuid playerGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(54321);

      ObjectGuid guildGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Guild>(98765);


      printf("Player GUID is guild: %s\n", playerGuid.IsGuild() ? "true" : "false");

      printf("Guild GUID is guild: %s\n", guildGuid.IsGuild() ? "true" : "false");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple bitwise comparison against predefined constants
    and has no performance impact. It only checks the high bits of the GUID to determine
    the type, making it very fast. The implementation relies on the internal structure
    of ObjectGuid where the type is encoded in specific bit positions.
