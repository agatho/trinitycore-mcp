  signature: int SpellInfo::GetDiminishingReturnsMaxLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum level at which diminishing returns apply for this spell.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum level threshold for which diminishing
    returns are effective for the specified spell. Diminishing returns are a game
    mechanic that reduces the effectiveness of certain effects as players reach higher
    levels, typically applied to spells like crowd control abilities or debuffs. The
    returned value indicates the highest level at which these effects will still diminish
    in effectiveness. This is crucial for understanding how spell mechanics behave
    across different player levels and for proper implementation of game balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: The maximum level at which diminishing returns apply, represented as an
    integer value. A return value of 0 indicates that diminishing returns do not apply
    to this spell, while positive values indicate the level threshold beyond which
    diminishing returns take effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int maxLevel = spellInfo->GetDiminishingReturnsMaxLevel();\nif (maxLevel\
      \ > 0)\n    std::cout << \"Diminishing returns apply up to level \" << maxLevel\
      \ << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine the behavior of diminishing returns across different player levels.
    It's important to note that this value may vary between different spell types
    and is often tied to specific game mechanics like player level cap or spell-specific
    configurations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it directly affects how
    spell effects behave in relation to player levels. Incorrect handling of diminishing
    returns can lead to imbalanced gameplay or incorrect behavior in crowd control
    mechanics.
