documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of battle pet slots available to the player
  description: The GetSlots method retrieves the current count of battle pet slots
    that are allocated to a player character. This value determines how many battle
    pets the player can actively manage and use in battles. The returned value is
    typically influenced by the player's level, class, and any purchased expansions
    or account features that grant additional pet slots. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the total number of battle
    pet slots available for the player. The value is typically between 0 and 10, depending
    on character progression and account features.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int slots = player->GetBattlePetMgr()->GetSlots();\nif (slots > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Player has available battle pet slots\n    printf(\"Available battle\
      \ pet slots: %d\\n\", slots);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference to an internal integer value, so
    modifying the returned reference will not affect the actual slot count. The value
    may change dynamically as the player levels up or purchases additional pet slots
    through in-game purchases.
