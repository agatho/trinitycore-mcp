  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetPriestOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of offensive cooldowns currently active on the priest
    player.
  description: The GetPriestOffensiveCooldowns method is used within the PvPCombatAI
    class to determine how many offensive abilities are currently on cooldown for
    a specified priest player. This information is crucial for AI decision-making
    in PvP scenarios, as it helps the AI understand which offensive spells can be
    cast immediately and which ones must be delayed. The method takes a pointer to
    a player object and returns an integer representing the count of active offensive
    cooldowns. It's part of the core combat logic that governs how NPCs behave during
    player-versus-player encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which offensive cooldowns are being
      counted. Must be a valid priest class instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: An integer representing the number of offensive cooldowns currently active
    on the specified priest player. Returns 0 if no offensive cooldowns are active
    or if the input player is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP Combat AI
    code: "int cooldownCount = ai->GetPriestOffensiveCooldowns(&player);\nif (cooldownCount\
      \ == 0) {\n    // All offensive abilities are available\n    player.CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FLASH_HEAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Cooldown Count for AI Decision Making
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = dynamic_cast<PvPCombatAI*>(unit->GetAI());\nif (ai) {\n\
      \    int cooldowns = ai->GetPriestOffensiveCooldowns(&player);\n    if (cooldowns\
      \ < 3) {\n        // Safe to use offensive abilities\n        player.CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_HOLY_FIRE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other cooldown management
    functions within the PvPCombatAI class. The implementation likely involves iterating
    through the player's spell cooldowns and filtering those that are offensive abilities
    specific to the priest class. Performance impact should be minimal since it only
    counts active cooldowns rather than processing each ability individually.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and represents a priest
    class instance; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method assumes that
    offensive cooldowns are tracked separately from defensive or utility cooldowns,
    so results might not reflect all possible spell restrictions.
