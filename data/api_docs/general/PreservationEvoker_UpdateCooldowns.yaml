  signature: void PreservationEvoker::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldowns for the Preservation Evoker's abilities based on the
    elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers of a Preservation Evoker's special abilities. It processes
    the time difference (diff) passed to it, typically from the game loop's update
    cycle, to decrement active cooldowns and handle ability readiness. This method
    ensures that abilities become available again after their cooldown periods have
    expired, maintaining proper game balance and player progression. The method is
    usually called during the creature or player's update tick to synchronize cooldown
    states with in-game time.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void PlayerAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_player->GetTypeId() ==\
      \ TYPEID_PLAYER)\n    {\n        if (PreservationEvoker* evoker = dynamic_cast<PreservationEvoker*>(m_player))\n\
      \        {\n            evoker->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the AI update loop or a similar
    periodic game tick. It's crucial that the diff parameter accurately reflects the
    time elapsed since the last call to ensure proper cooldown behavior. The implementation
    may involve internal tracking of ability states and should be called regularly
    for consistent gameplay.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the appropriate update context, as
    it relies on accurate timing from the game loop. Incorrect usage can lead to abilities
    becoming permanently stuck in cooldown or appearing ready before their cooldown
    has expired.
