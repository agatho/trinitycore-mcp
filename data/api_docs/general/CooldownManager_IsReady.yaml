documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell is ready to be cast by verifying its cooldown status.
  description: The IsReady method determines whether a specified spell is currently
    available for casting by checking if its cooldown period has expired. This method
    is commonly used in game logic to prevent players from casting spells before their
    cooldown timers have completed. It returns true if the spell is ready, and false
    if it is still on cooldown. The method operates on the internal cooldown tracking
    system of the CooldownManager, which maintains a mapping of spell IDs to their
    respective cooldown states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell is ready to be cast (i.e., its cooldown
    has expired), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (cooldownManager.IsReady(12345)) {\n    // Spell is ready, proceed with\
      \ casting\n    player.CastSpell(target, 12345);\n} else {\n    // Spell is on\
      \ cooldown\n    player.SendSystemMessage(\"Spell is still on cooldown.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Cooldown Check Before Action
    code: "uint32 spellId = 98765;\nif (cooldownManager.IsReady(spellId)) {\n    //\
      \ Perform spell casting logic\n    player.CastSpell(target, spellId);\n    cooldownManager.AddCooldown(spellId,\
      \ 10000); // Apply 10 second cooldown\n} else {\n    // Handle cooldown restriction\n\
      \    SendChatMessage(\"You must wait before using this ability again.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the cooldown state of spells; it only reads from
    the internal cooldown tracking. The cooldown manager typically tracks cooldowns
    per spell ID and may account for different types of cooldowns such as global cooldowns
    or category-based cooldowns depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Ensure that cooldowns are properly initialized before calling IsReady,
    especially if using custom cooldown logic. This method assumes that the CooldownManager
    has been correctly set up with relevant spell data and may return unexpected results
    if spell IDs are not registered.
