documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SelectionContext object with default values.
  description: The SelectionContext constructor initializes a new instance of the
    SelectionContext class. This method sets up the internal state of the selection
    context, preparing it for use in game entity selection operations within the TrinityCore
    framework. The constructor typically initializes member variables to their default
    states and may set up necessary data structures for tracking selected entities
    or managing selection criteria. This is a fundamental part of the selection system
    used by various game mechanics including player targeting, quest object interaction,
    and NPC dialogue systems.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SelectionContext Initialization
    code: 'SelectionContext context;

      // context is now initialized with default values

      Player* selectedPlayer = context.GetSelectedPlayer(); // Will return nullptr
      initially'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when declaring a SelectionContext
    variable on the stack. The object should be properly initialized before use in
    any selection-related operations. In TrinityCore, selection contexts are often
    used in conjunction with WorldSession and player interaction systems.
