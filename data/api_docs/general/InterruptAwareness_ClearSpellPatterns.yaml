documentation:
  brief: Clears all registered spell patterns from the interrupt awareness system
  description: The ClearSpellPatterns method removes all previously added spell patterns
    from the InterruptAwareness class, effectively resetting the system's tracking
    of interruptible spells. This method is typically used when reconfiguring or resetting
    the interrupt behavior for a specific unit or during cleanup operations. The operation
    is immediate and does not require any additional processing or validation. Any
    subsequent calls to check for interruptible spells will return no matches until
    new patterns are registered.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      awareness.ClearSpellPatterns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete reset of the spell pattern registry. It should
    be used carefully in performance-critical sections as it may trigger internal
    cleanup operations. The method is thread-safe and can be called from any context.
