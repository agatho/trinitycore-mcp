  method: extractQuotedArg
  signature: char * ChatHandler::extractQuotedArg(char * args)
documentation:
  brief: Extracts a quoted argument from command line arguments, handling escaped
    quotes and returning a pointer to the next unprocessed argument.
  description: The extractQuotedArg method processes command-line input to extract
    a single quoted argument, properly handling escaped quotes within the string.
    It modifies the input string by replacing quote characters with null terminators,
    effectively splitting the argument in place. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    ChatHandler class for parsing user commands that contain arguments enclosed in
    double quotes. The function advances the input pointer to point past the extracted
    argument and returns a pointer to the start of the quoted string. It assumes that
    the input string is properly formatted with at least one opening quote character,
    and it handles nested or escaped quotes according to standard shell-like parsing
    rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the beginning of the extracted quoted argument within the
    original args string, or nullptr if no valid quoted argument is found. The returned
    pointer points to a null-terminated string that has been modified in-place by
    replacing the closing quote with a null terminator.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'char args[] = "\"Hello World\" more arguments";

      char* extracted = handler->extractQuotedArg(args);

      // extracted now points to "Hello World" (null-terminated)

      // args is now modified to "\0 more arguments"'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling escaped quotes
    code: 'char args[] = "\"He said \\\"Hello\\\"\"";

      char* extracted = handler->extractQuotedArg(args);

      // extracted points to "He said \"Hello\""

      // The method properly handles the escaped quotes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This function modifies the input string in-place by replacing quote characters
    with null terminators. It's designed for use within TrinityCore's command processing
    pipeline where arguments are parsed from user input. The function assumes that
    the input is a valid command line string and handles edge cases such as empty
    quoted strings or improperly escaped quotes gracefully.
  warnings: This method modifies the input argument string in-place, which can have
    unintended side effects if the original string is needed after calling this function.
    Care should be taken when using this function in contexts where the original string
    must remain unchanged. Also, this function does not perform any validation on
    the content of the quoted argument beyond basic parsing.
