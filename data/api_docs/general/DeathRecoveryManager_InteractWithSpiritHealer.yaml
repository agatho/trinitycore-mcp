documentation:
  brief: Attempts to interact with a spirit healer to recover from death
  description: The InteractWithSpiritHealer method handles the player's interaction
    with a spirit healer object after death. This method typically checks if the player
    is in a valid state to be resurrected, verifies that a spirit healer is within
    range, and processes the resurrection mechanics. It may also handle the transition
    of the player from the dead state back to life, including updating their health,
    mana, and any relevant game state variables. The method is part of the death recovery
    system in TrinityCore and ensures proper handling of the resurrection process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the interaction with the spirit healer was successful and
    the player has been resurrected, or false if the interaction failed due to invalid
    conditions such as being in an invalid state, no spirit healer present, or other
    game restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of spirit healer interaction
    code: "if (player->GetDeathRecoveryManager()->InteractWithSpiritHealer()) {\n\
      \    // Player successfully resurrected\n    player->SetHealth(player->GetMaxHealth());\n\
      \    player->SetMana(player->GetMaxMana());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player right-clicks on a spirit healer
    or uses a resurrection-related spell. The implementation may vary depending on
    the specific TrinityCore version and server configuration. It's important to note
    that this method should only be invoked when the player is in a dead state.
  warnings: Calling this method while the player is not dead or when no spirit healer
    is available will likely result in a failed interaction and potentially unexpected
    behavior. Ensure proper checks are performed before invoking this method.
