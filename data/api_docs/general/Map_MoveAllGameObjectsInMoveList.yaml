documentation:
  brief: Moves all game objects in the map's move list to their new positions.
  description: The MoveAllGameObjectsInMoveList method processes and applies position
    updates for all game objects that have been marked for movement within the current
    map. This method is typically invoked during the map update cycle to ensure that
    GameObjects are properly relocated according to their pending movement operations.
    It handles the synchronization of object positions across the server's internal
    data structures and ensures that clients receive updated positioning information.
    The method operates on a list of objects that have been queued for movement, applying
    any pending transforms or position changes.

  - title: Basic Usage in Map Update Loop
    code: "void Map::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n \
      \   MoveAllGameObjectsInMoveList();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the map's update loop and should
    not typically be invoked directly by external code. It assumes that movement operations
    have already been queued for objects in the move list, and it processes these
    operations sequentially. Performance-wise, this method may cause noticeable overhead
    on maps with many moving objects.
