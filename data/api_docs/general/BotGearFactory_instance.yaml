documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotGearFactory class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotGearFactory
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the factory exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access the global factory responsible
    for creating and managing bot gear configurations. The returned pointer should
    be used directly without attempting to delete or manage its lifetime, as it represents
    a globally managed singleton object. This pattern is essential for maintaining
    consistent bot gear generation across different parts of the TrinityCore AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotGearFactory instance. The method never returns
    NULL under normal operation, as the singleton is typically initialized during
    system startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotGearFactory singleton
    code: 'BotGearFactory* factory = BotGearFactory::instance();

      // Use the factory to create bot gear configurations

      BotGear* gear = factory->CreateGear(playerClass, level);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe in most TrinityCore implementations as it typically
    uses static initialization or thread-safe singleton patterns. The underlying factory
    instance is usually initialized during server startup and remains valid for the
    entire application lifetime.
