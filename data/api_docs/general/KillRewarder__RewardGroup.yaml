  class: KillRewarder
  method: _RewardGroup
  signature: void KillRewarder::_RewardGroup(const Group * group, const Player * killer)
documentation:
  brief: Distributes kill rewards to group members when a player kills a creature
    or another player.
  description: The _RewardGroup method is responsible for handling the distribution
    of rewards, such as experience points and loot, among all members of a group who
    participated in a kill. This method ensures that each eligible group member receives
    appropriate rewards based on their contribution to the kill. It typically gets
    invoked after a successful kill event within the game's combat system. The method
    takes into account group dynamics, including whether players are within the required
    proximity and have been actively engaged in the fight.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who participated
      in the kill. Must not be null.
  - name: killer
    description: Pointer to the Player object who performed the killing blow. Must
      not be null and must be a member of the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat handler
    code: "void OnCreatureKilled(Creature* creature, Player* killer) {\n    Group*\
      \ group = killer->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n        _RewardGroup(group, killer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and killer are valid and properly initialized.
    It does not perform any checks for group validity or player status beyond ensuring
    pointers are non-null. The actual reward distribution logic may vary depending
    on the type of kill (creature vs. player) and group settings such as loot rules.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'group' and 'killer' parameters are valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. Calling with a null pointer will likely
    result in a crash or assertion failure.
