  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: RecoverFromCoordinationFailure
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::RecoverFromCoordinationFailure(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Reinitializes group coordination state after a failure has occurred.
  description: The RecoverFromCoordinationFailure method is responsible for resetting
    and reestablishing the coordination state of a group within the InstanceCoordination
    system. This method is typically invoked when a group experiences a failure during
    instance coordination, such as a player disconnecting or a synchronization error
    occurring. It ensures that the group's instance data is properly reset and that
    subsequent coordination attempts can proceed without interference from previous
    failed states. The method handles cleanup of temporary coordination data and prepares
    the group for potential re-assignment to an instance or retry of the coordination
    process.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose coordination state needs to be
      recovered. This parameter is required and must point to a valid Group instance
      that has previously participated in instance coordination.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage after group coordination failure
    code: "Group* failedGroup = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupById(12345);\nif (failedGroup)\n\
      {\n    sInstanceCoordination->RecoverFromCoordinationFailure(failedGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a group has experienced a coordination
    failure. It is not intended for normal group operations and may have performance
    implications if used excessively. The method assumes that the Group pointer passed
    in is valid and has been properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group that is currently in an active instance
    or being coordinated may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all players in
    the group are either disconnected or have been properly removed from the instance
    before calling this method.
