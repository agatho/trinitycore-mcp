  class: BotAIQuestIntegration
  method: InitializeQuestManager
  signature: void BotAIQuestIntegration::InitializeQuestManager(BotAI * ai, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the quest manager for a bot AI instance, setting up necessary
    quest-related data structures and state tracking.
  description: The InitializeQuestManager method prepares the quest management system
    for a specific bot AI instance by initializing internal data structures, registering
    quest-related callbacks, and establishing the necessary state tracking for quest
    progression. This method ensures that the bot can properly handle quest acceptance,
    completion, and objective tracking within the TrinityCore framework. It is typically
    called during the bot's initialization phase to ensure all quest-related functionality
    is ready for use. The method requires both a valid BotAI instance and a Player
    object representing the bot itself to be passed as parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will manage quest-related behavior
      for this bot. Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the actual bot character.
      Must not be null and must be a valid player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'BotAIQuestIntegration questIntegration;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Valid bot player object

      BotAI* botAI = ...; // Valid bot AI instance

      questIntegration.InitializeQuestManager(botAI, myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Error Checking
    code: "BotAIQuestIntegration questIntegration;\nif (botAI && myBot) {\n    questIntegration.InitializeQuestManager(botAI,\
      \ myBot);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid pointers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. The method assumes
    that the provided BotAI and Player objects are fully constructed and valid before
    being passed in.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for either parameter will likely cause crashes or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that both parameters point to valid, initialized objects
    before calling this method.
