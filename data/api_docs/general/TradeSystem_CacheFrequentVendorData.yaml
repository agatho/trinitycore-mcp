  brief: Caches frequently accessed vendor data for performance optimization in the

  description: The CacheFrequentVendorData method preloads and stores commonly requested
    vendor-related information into memory to reduce database queries and improve
    response times during trade operations. This method is typically invoked during
    server initialization or periodic maintenance intervals to ensure that essential
    vendor data such as item prices, availability, and stock levels are readily accessible.
    It helps minimize latency when players interact with vendors by avoiding repeated
    lookups in the database for frequently requested items.
