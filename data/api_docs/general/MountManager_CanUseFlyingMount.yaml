  signature: bool MountManager::CanUseFlyingMount(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can use a flying mount based on their current
    game state and restrictions.
  description: The CanUseFlyingMount method evaluates if a player is eligible to use
    a flying mount in World of Warcraft. This includes checking for valid player states,
    such as being in a location where flying is allowed, not under certain debuffs
    that prevent flight, and having the necessary spell or ability unlocked. The method
    returns true if the player can currently fly, and false otherwise. It's commonly
    used by the game engine to enforce mount usage rules and prevent players from
    using flying mounts in inappropriate zones or situations.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or internal
      game object reference. This parameter is likely used to retrieve player-specific
      data such as current zone restrictions, spell availability, and status effects
      that affect mount usage.
  returns: 'Returns true if the specified player can use a flying mount at this time,
    false otherwise. The method may return false due to various conditions including
    but not limited to: being in a non-flying zone, having a debuff that prevents
    flight, lacking required spells or abilities, or being in an invalid game state
    such as combat or during certain quest events.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nif (mountManager->CanUseFlyingMount(&playerId))\
      \ {\n    // Player can use flying mount\n    player->SetCanFly(true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Player cannot use flying mount\n    player->SetCanFly(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Mount System
    code: "void Player::HandleMountUse()\n{\n    if (mountManager->CanUseFlyingMount(&this->GetGUID().GetRawValue()))\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with flying mount activation\n        this->SendPacket(PrepareFlyMountPacket());\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Notify player they cannot fly\n        SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You cannot use a flying mount here.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the current zone's flight restrictions,
    player debuffs, and spell availability. It may also consider game events or seasonal
    restrictions that affect mount usage. The method is probably called frequently
    during gameplay to ensure mount behavior remains consistent with game rules.
  warnings: Incorrectly handling the return value of this method can lead to players
    being able to use flying mounts in invalid locations or situations, which breaks
    game balance and immersion. Always validate player state before allowing mount
    usage.
