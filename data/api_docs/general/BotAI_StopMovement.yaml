  class: BotAI
  method: StopMovement
  signature: void BotAI::StopMovement()
documentation:
  brief: Stops the bot's current movement and clears any pending movement commands.
  description: The StopMovement method halts the execution of any ongoing movement
    actions for the bot AI. It interrupts the bot's current pathing behavior, cancels
    queued movement commands, and ensures that the bot ceases all active movement
    operations. This method is typically used when the bot needs to pause its movement,
    either temporarily or permanently, in response to game events or AI decision-making
    processes. The method does not return any value and operates synchronously on
    the current thread.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnPlayerEnterCombat()\n{\n    // Stop the bot from moving\
      \ when entering combat\n    StopMovement();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stopping Movement Before Casting Spell
    code: "void MyBotAI::CastSpellWhenReady()\n{\n    if (CanCastSpell())\n    {\n\
      \        StopMovement(); // Ensure bot is stationary before casting\n      \
      \  CastSpell(SPELL_FIREBALL);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may interrupt ongoing AI behaviors
    or quest-related movement sequences. It's recommended to check if the bot is already
    stopped before calling this method to avoid unnecessary overhead.
