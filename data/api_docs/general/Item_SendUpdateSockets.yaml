documentation:
  brief: Updates socketed gem information for the item to the client.
  description: This method sends the updated socketed gem information for an item
    to the client, ensuring that the player's inventory reflects the current socketing
    status of the item. It is typically called when a gem is inserted or removed from
    an item, or when the item's socketing state changes due to game mechanics such
    as enchanting or gem removal. The method handles sending the appropriate packet
    to update the client's view of the item's sockets, including any gem bonuses and
    enchantment effects that may be present.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void SendUpdateSockets() {\n    // This method is called internally when\
      \ a gem is socketed\n    // or removed from an item\n    // No parameters required\n\
      }\n\n// Example of how it might be used in a larger context\nItem* item = new\
      \ Item();\nitem->SendUpdateSockets();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine when socketing
    changes occur, and should not normally be called directly by developers. It involves
    sending a packet to the client that updates the item's socketed gem information,
    including any bonuses or enchantment effects that may be present.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by developers unless in very
    specific circumstances related to custom game mechanics or debugging. It is part
    of the internal item update process and may cause client-side issues if called
    incorrectly.
