documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battleground bracket identifier associated with this PVP difficulty
    entry.
  description: The GetBracketId method returns the BattlegroundBracketId that corresponds
    to the PvP difficulty entry. This identifier is used internally by the TrinityCore
    server to map specific PvP difficulty levels to their respective battleground
    brackets, which define the player level ranges and other constraints for battleground
    participation. The method does not perform any validation or transformation of
    the data; it simply retrieves and returns the stored bracket ID value. This is
    typically used during battleground matchmaking and player eligibility checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BattlegroundBracketId value representing the identifier of the battleground
    bracket associated with this PvP difficulty entry. This ID is used to determine
    which battleground bracket a player should be matched into based on their PvP
    difficulty settings.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Bracket ID for PvP Difficulty
    code: 'PVPDifficultyEntry* entry = sPVPDifficultyMgr->GetPVPDifficultyEntry(12345);

      BattlegroundBracketId bracketId = entry->GetBracketId();

      // Use bracketId to determine battleground eligibility or matchmaking rules'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that directly returns a cached value. It should
    be used in performance-critical code paths with caution as it may be called frequently
    during battleground matching processes. The returned bracket ID is guaranteed
    to be valid within the context of the current game data.
