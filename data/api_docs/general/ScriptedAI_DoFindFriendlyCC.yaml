  class: ScriptedAI
  method: DoFindFriendlyCC
  signature: int ScriptedAI::DoFindFriendlyCC(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the GUID of the nearest friendly unit with a crowd control
    effect applied within the specified range.
  description: The DoFindFriendlyCC method searches for the closest friendly unit
    (player or creature) that has a crowd control debuff active within the given range.
    It is typically used in AI scripts to identify targets that are currently incapacitated
    or otherwise controlled by an enemy. The method performs a radius-based search
    and returns the GUID of the first matching unit found, or 0 if no suitable target
    exists. This functionality is commonly employed in scripted AI behaviors where
    the creature needs to prioritize or avoid targeting units under crowd control
    effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the GUID (Global Unique Identifier) of the nearest friendly unit
    with a crowd control effect within range, or 0 if no such unit is found. The GUID
    uniquely identifies the target unit in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find and target friendly CC unit
    code: "if (uint64 targetGuid = DoFindFriendlyCC(30.0f))\n{\n    if (Unit* target\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, targetGuid))\n    {\n        // Perform action\
      \ on the friendly CC unit\n        me->Attack(target, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ScriptedAI framework and should only be called
    from within AI update routines or event handlers. The range parameter determines
    how far the AI will search for targets; larger ranges may impact performance.
    The method internally uses the ObjectAccessor to locate units, so it requires
    valid game object references.
  warnings: Ensure that the range value is appropriate for your use case to avoid
    unnecessary performance overhead. Calling this method outside of proper AI execution
    contexts may result in undefined behavior or invalid GUID returns. Be cautious
    when using the returned GUID without verifying its validity before attempting
    operations on the target.
