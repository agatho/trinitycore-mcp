documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given item template represents a consumable item.
  description: The IsConsumable method evaluates whether a specified ItemTemplate
    object corresponds to an item that is classified as consumable. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, this determination is typically based on the item's class
    and subclass identifiers, which define its usability and behavior within the game.
    Consumable items are those that can be used once and then disappear from the player's
    inventory, such as potions, food, or scrolls. This method is commonly used during
    vendor interactions to determine if an item should be available for purchase or
    sale. The method does not perform any side effects and simply returns a boolean
    value indicating the consumable status of the item.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item template represents a consumable item, false otherwise.
    This includes items such as potions, food, bandages, and other one-time use items
    that are typically sold by vendors.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is consumable before offering it for sale
    code: "ItemTemplate const* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (vendorManager.IsConsumable(itemTemplate)) {\n    // Add item to vendor's\
      \ sell list\n    vendorManager.AddSellableItem(itemTemplate);\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Item is not consumable, skip\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal classification of items within the TrinityCore
    database. It checks against predefined item class and subclass values that correspond
    to consumable items in the game's data structures.
