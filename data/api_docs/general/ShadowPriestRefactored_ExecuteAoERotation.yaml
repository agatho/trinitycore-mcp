  class: ShadowPriestRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void ShadowPriestRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32
    enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the shadow priest's AoE rotation logic based on target count and
    enemy proximity.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for a shadow
    priest's area-of-effect combat rotation. It evaluates the current combat scenario,
    considering the number of enemies present and their positioning, to determine
    the optimal sequence of spells and abilities to cast. This method typically prioritizes
    damage-over-time effects, mana-efficient abilities, and crowd control mechanics
    suitable for multi-target encounters. The implementation may adjust spell priorities
    based on enemy count, debuff durations, and resource management strategies specific
    to the shadow priest class.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the primary target or target group
      identifier. Used to determine combat focus and targeting logic for AoE spells.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the number of enemies currently
      within the priest's attack range. Influences spell selection and rotation priority.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: 'int primaryTarget = 12345;

      uint32 enemies = 5;

      shadowPriest->ExecuteAoERotation(&primaryTarget, enemies);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Count Handling
    code: "int* targetPtr = &currentTarget;\nuint32 enemyCount = GetEnemyCountInArea(10.0f);\n\
      if (enemyCount > 0)\n{\n    shadowPriest->ExecuteAoERotation(targetPtr, enemyCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle and assumes
    that the target list and enemy count have been properly updated. The implementation
    may include internal state tracking for spell cooldowns and debuff management.
    Performance considerations include minimizing unnecessary calculations when enemy
    count is low.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent undefined behavior. The enemyCount parameter should be accurately calculated
    to avoid incorrect spell selection in combat scenarios.
