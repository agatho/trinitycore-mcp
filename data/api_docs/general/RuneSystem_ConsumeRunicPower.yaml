  class: RuneSystem
  method: ConsumeRunicPower
  signature: void RuneSystem::ConsumeRunicPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of runic power from the player's rune system.
  description: The ConsumeRunicPower method reduces the current runic power available
    to a player by the specified amount. This method is typically invoked when abilities
    or spells that require runic power are used. The rune system in World of Warcraft
    manages energy for Death Knights, allowing them to perform powerful attacks and
    abilities. This function ensures proper resource management and prevents over-consumption
    of runic power. It does not validate whether the requested amount is available;
    it simply deducts the specified value from the current runic power total.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of runic power to consume. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the units of runic power to subtract from the current resource
      pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RuneSystem* runeSys = player->GetRuneSystem();

      runeSys->ConsumeRunicPower(10);

      // Consumes 10 units of runic power from the player''s current pool.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming Power for a Spell
    code: "if (player->GetRuneSystem()->GetRunicPower() >= 25)\n{\n    player->GetRuneSystem()->ConsumeRunicPower(25);\n\
      \    // Execute spell that costs 25 runic power\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal runic power counter without any
    validation or checks for depletion. It is expected that callers ensure sufficient
    runic power exists before invoking this method to avoid negative values in the
    resource pool.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the current runic power
    may result in a negative value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in gameplay
    mechanics or UI display. Always validate available resources before consumption.
