documentation:
  brief: Records that a group member has won loot with the specified item ID.
  description: The RecordLootWon method is used to log or track when a player in a
    group wins loot during a loot roll. This functionality is typically part of the
    group loot system in TrinityCore, where it ensures proper tracking and distribution
    of loot among group members. The method takes a single parameter representing
    the item ID that was won. It likely updates internal data structures or logs to
    reflect this event for future reference or reporting purposes.

  examples:
  - title: Recording Loot Win
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->RecordLootWon(12345); // Records that item ID 12345 was won by
      a group member'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the internal loot tracking system and may be
    called automatically during loot distribution. It does not directly interact with
    players or items but rather maintains an internal record of loot wins within the
    group context.
