  class: InteractionManager
  method: ResetInteraction
  signature: void InteractionManager::ResetInteraction(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the interaction state of a bot player, clearing any active interactions
    or quests.
  description: The ResetInteraction method clears all ongoing interactions for a specified
    bot player within the TrinityCore framework. This includes resetting quest states,
    interaction timers, and any temporary flags that may have been set during previous
    interactions. The method ensures that the bot returns to a clean state where it
    can begin new interactions without interference from prior activities. It is typically
    called when transitioning between different AI behaviors or when a bot needs to
    be reinitialized for fresh interaction cycles.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose interaction
      state will be reset. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset of Bot Interaction
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player

      InteractionManager::ResetInteraction(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before Starting New Quest
    code: 'Player* bot = GetBotPlayer();

      InteractionManager::ResetInteraction(bot);

      // Proceed with initiating new quest logic

      bot->StartQuest(...);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked carefully as it can affect the bot's current
    quest progression and interaction state. It is recommended to call this before
    changing the bot's AI behavior or when preparing for a new set of interactions.
  warnings: Calling ResetInteraction on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the player object passed is valid and represents an actual bot instance.
