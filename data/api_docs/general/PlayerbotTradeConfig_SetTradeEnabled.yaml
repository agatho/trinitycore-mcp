  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: SetTradeEnabled
  signature: void PlayerbotTradeConfig::SetTradeEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables trading functionality for player bots within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The SetTradeEnabled method controls whether player bots are allowed
    to engage in trading activities. This configuration setting affects the bot's
    ability to initiate, accept, or participate in trades with other players or NPCs.
    The method directly modifies an internal flag that governs trade behavior, which
    can be queried using the corresponding GetTradeEnabled() method. This functionality
    is particularly relevant for bot AI scripts and server configurations where automated
    trading behavior needs to be controlled programmatically.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean value indicating whether trading should be enabled (true)
      or disabled (false) for player bots.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Trading for Player Bots
    code: 'PlayerbotTradeConfig config;

      config.SetTradeEnabled(true);

      // Bot will now be able to trade items with other players'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Trading Based on Server Condition
    code: "if (serverIsInMaintenanceMode)\n{\n    PlayerbotTradeConfig config;\n \
      \   config.SetTradeEnabled(false);\n    // Prevents bots from trading during\
      \ maintenance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a configuration flag that is typically checked during
    bot AI decision-making processes. Changes made using this method take effect immediately
    for newly created or updated bot instances, but may not affect already running
    bots without explicit refresh or restart operations.
  warnings: Modifying trade settings while bots are actively trading may result in
    unexpected behavior or incomplete transactions. It's recommended to disable trading
    before making configuration changes and re-enable after ensuring all active trades
    have completed.
