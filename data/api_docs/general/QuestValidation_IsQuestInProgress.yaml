  signature: bool QuestValidation::IsQuestInProgress(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has an active quest in progress with the specified quest
    ID
  description: The IsQuestInProgress method determines whether a given player is currently
    on a specific quest. It evaluates the player's quest log to see if the quest is
    active and not yet completed. This method is commonly used in questing scripts,
    bot logic, and quest validation systems within TrinityCore. The method requires
    a valid player object and a valid quest ID to function correctly. It returns true
    if the quest exists in the player's active quest log, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to check for progress. Must be
      a valid quest ID from the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose quest progress is being checked.
      Must not be null and must represent an active player in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest is currently in progress for the player
    (i.e., it exists in their active quest log), false if the quest is not found or
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Progress Check
    code: "if (QuestValidation::IsQuestInProgress(12345, player)) {\n    // Player\
      \ is currently on quest 12345\n    player->SendNotification(\"You are still\
      \ working on this quest!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Bot Logic
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player reference\nif (QuestValidation::IsQuestInProgress(67890,\
      \ bot)) {\n    // Bot should continue quest 67890\n    bot->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Continue with quest 67890\");\n} else {\n    // Quest is not in progress\n \
      \   bot->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Quest 67890 is no longer active\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current quest log state and does not consider
    quest completion status or objectives. It assumes that the player object passed
    is valid and properly initialized. The method may be called from various game
    contexts including AI scripts, quest handlers, and event triggers.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer exceptions. This method only checks for active quests in progress,
    not whether a quest has been completed or abandoned.
