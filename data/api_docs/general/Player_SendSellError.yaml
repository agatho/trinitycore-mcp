  signature: void Player::SendSellError(int msg, Creature * creature, int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a sell error message to the player's client when a vendor fails to
    process a sell transaction.
  description: This method is used to notify the player's client about a sell transaction
    error that occurs when attempting to sell an item to a creature vendor. It typically
    triggers when the vendor cannot process the sell due to inventory constraints,
    item requirements, or other game mechanics issues. The method sends a specific
    error message to the player's client based on the provided parameters, allowing
    for proper error handling and user feedback.
  parameters:
  - name: msg
    description: The error message identifier that determines which specific sell
      error is sent to the client. Valid values include various error codes such as
      1 (for item not found), 2 (for item already sold), or 3 (for item not available).
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor that failed
      to process the sell transaction. This parameter is essential for identifying
      which vendor sent the error message.
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the item being sold, used to identify
      which specific item caused the sell error. This value is crucial for proper
      error handling and client-side identification of the problematic item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Sell Error Usage
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Creature* vendor = GetCreature();

      player->SendSellError(1, vendor, 12345);

      // This sends error message 1 to the player''s client'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Sell Error Handling
    code: '// Example of handling sell errors in a transaction context

      Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Creature* vendor = GetCreature();

      uint32 itemGuid = 12345;

      int error_msg = 3;

      player->SendSellError(error_msg, vendor, itemGuid);

      // This sends error message 3 to the player''s client for item with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called internally by the game engine when sell transactions
    fail. It requires proper handling of error messages and GUIDs to ensure correct
    client-side behavior. The method may be used in conjunction with other player-related
    methods for comprehensive transaction handling.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a sell transaction fails, as calling
    it incorrectly may cause confusion or errors in the player's client. It is important
    to ensure that the error message and GUID values are valid before calling this
    method.
