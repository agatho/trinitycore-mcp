  signature: void ElementalShamanRefactored::ElementalShamanRefactored(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an Elemental Shaman AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The ElementalShamanRefactored constructor initializes a new instance
    of the ElementalShamanRefactored class, setting up the AI behavior for an elemental
    shaman character. This method configures the bot's spell selection, combat strategies,
    and resource management based on the provided player object. The initialization
    process includes setting up the shaman's elemental abilities, determining optimal
    spell rotation sequences, and establishing the bot's decision-making framework
    for both single-target and AoE encounters. This constructor is typically called
    when creating a new AI-controlled elemental shaman character within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Elemental Shaman Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      ElementalShamanRefactored shamanBot(bot);

      // The bot is now initialized with elemental shaman AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes the provided Player object has valid character data
    and is properly initialized. The AI behavior will adapt based on the player's
    level, equipment, and current game state. Performance considerations include initialization
    time which scales with the complexity of spell configurations and AI decision
    trees.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player parameter is not null before calling this constructor.
    Attempting to initialize a bot with an invalid player object may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes during gameplay.
