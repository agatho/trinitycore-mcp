documentation:
  brief: Unsummons any temporary pet that is currently summoned by the player.
  description: This method removes any temporary pet (such as a summoned companion
    or guardian) from the player's control. It is typically used when the player needs
    to release a pet that was summoned temporarily, such as during combat or when
    changing zones. The method ensures that no pet remains in the player's possession
    after execution, effectively clearing the pet's summoning state and removing it
    from the game world.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: player->UnsummonPetTemporaryIfAny();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player actions such as changing zones
    or entering combat, where the player may need to release their pet. It does not
    affect permanent pets or summoning any other type of pet; it only targets temporary
    summoning.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in scenarios involving combat or
    zone changes, as it may result in loss of control over summoned pets if not handled
    properly.
