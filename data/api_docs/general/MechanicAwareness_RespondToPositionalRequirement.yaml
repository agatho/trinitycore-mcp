  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: RespondToPositionalRequirement
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::RespondToPositionalRequirement(Spell * spell,
    Player * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and responds to positional requirements for a spell cast by a player
    within the MechanicAwareness system.
  description: The RespondToPositionalRequirement method is responsible for assessing
    whether a spell's positional casting requirements are met by the caster. This
    method is typically invoked during spell execution to ensure that the player's
    orientation, distance, or positioning relative to targets aligns with the mechanics
    defined for the spell. It integrates with the broader MechanicAwareness framework
    to enforce game rules related to spell positioning and targeting. The method does
    not return a value but may modify internal state or trigger additional actions
    based on positional compliance.
  parameters:
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object representing the spell being cast. This
      parameter defines the spell's properties, including its positional requirements
      and casting mechanics.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is casting the spell. This parameter
      provides context about the caster's position, orientation, and other relevant
      attributes needed for positional evaluation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Casting Context
    code: "void MySpellHandler::CastSpell(Player* player, Spell* spell)\n{\n    MechanicAwareness\
      \ awareness;\n    awareness.RespondToPositionalRequirement(spell, player);\n\
      \    // Proceed with spell logic after positional check\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell processing pipeline and may be
    called automatically by the core engine during spell validation. Developers should
    not directly invoke this method unless implementing custom spell behavior or extending
    the MechanicAwareness system.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of positional requirements can lead to unexpected spell
    behavior or failure to meet game mechanics. Ensure that all positional checks
    are properly initialized before calling this method.
