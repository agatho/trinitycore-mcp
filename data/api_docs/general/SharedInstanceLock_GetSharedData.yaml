  signature: const SharedInstanceLockData * SharedInstanceLock::GetSharedData() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the shared instance lock data structure associated with this lock.
  description: The GetSharedData method provides access to the underlying SharedInstanceLockData
    object that contains metadata and state information for a shared instance lock.
    This data typically includes details such as the lock's identifier, owner information,
    expiration time, and other synchronization-related attributes. The returned pointer
    is const, ensuring that the internal state of the lock data cannot be modified
    through this interface. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's instance
    management system to query the current status and properties of shared instance
    locks, which are essential for coordinating access to shared game world resources
    among multiple players or game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the SharedInstanceLockData object associated with
    this lock. Returns nullptr if the lock has not been properly initialized or if
    no data is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const SharedInstanceLockData* data = instanceLock->GetSharedData();\nif\
      \ (data != nullptr)\n{\n    // Access lock properties\n    uint32 lockId = data->GetLockId();\n\
      \    time_t expirationTime = data->GetExpirationTime();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Lock Validity
    code: "const SharedInstanceLockData* data = sharedLock->GetSharedData();\nif (data\
      \ && data->IsValid())\n{\n    // Proceed with operations that require valid\
      \ lock data\n    std::cout << \"Lock is active for instance: \" << data->GetInstanceId()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid or expired lock\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Lock is not valid\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer is valid only as long as the SharedInstanceLock object
    remains in scope and has not been destroyed. This method does not perform any
    locking or synchronization internally, so callers should ensure thread safety
    if accessing from multiple threads. The data pointed to should be treated as read-only.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned data through the const pointer.
    Accessing the data after the parent SharedInstanceLock object has been destroyed
    results in undefined behavior. Always check for null return values before dereferencing
    the pointer.
