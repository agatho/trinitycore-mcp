documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the idle movement generator, stopping any ongoing idle movement
    behavior for the associated unit.
  description: The Deactivate method is used to halt the idle movement behavior of
    a unit that is currently using an IdleMovementGenerator. This method is typically
    called when the unit needs to transition to a different movement state or when
    the idle behavior should be temporarily suspended. The method ensures that any
    ongoing idle movement animations or pathfinding are stopped and cleaned up properly.
    It is part of the AI movement system in TrinityCore, where movement generators
    control how units move within the game world. This method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Example
    code: 'IdleMovementGenerator* idleGen = new IdleMovementGenerator();

      // ... some logic that activates the generator ...

      idleGen->Deactivate(nullptr); // Deactivate the idle movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system when transitioning
    between different movement states. It's important to note that calling Deactivate
    on an already deactivated generator should not cause issues, as the implementation
    likely includes checks to prevent redundant operations.
