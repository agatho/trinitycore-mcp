  class: Creature
  method: GetSpawnId
  signature: int Creature::GetSpawnId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique spawn identifier associated with this creature instance.
  description: The GetSpawnId method retrieves the spawn ID that uniquely identifies
    a creature's spawning point or instance within the game world. This identifier
    is used by the server to track and manage creature spawns, particularly in scenarios
    involving multiple spawns of the same creature template. The spawn ID typically
    corresponds to an entry in the creature_spawn table or similar internal tracking
    mechanism. This value remains constant for the lifetime of the creature instance
    and can be used to correlate creature instances with their original spawn definitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique spawn identifier for this creature instance.
    A value of 0 typically indicates an invalid or uninitialized spawn ID, while positive
    values represent valid spawn identifiers assigned by the server during creature
    creation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Spawn ID
    code: "Creature* creature = ...; // Assume creature is initialized\nint spawnId\
      \ = creature->GetSpawnId();\nif (spawnId > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Creature spawned\
      \ with ID: %d\\n\", spawnId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Spawn ID for Spawn Tracking
    code: "void OnCreatureSpawn(Creature* creature)\n{\n    int spawnId = creature->GetSpawnId();\n\
      \    if (spawnId > 0)\n    {\n        // Log or store spawn information for\
      \ tracking\n        sLog->outString(\"Creature spawned with ID: %d\", spawnId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The spawn ID is assigned during creature creation and remains immutable throughout
    the creature's lifetime. It serves as a key for linking creature instances to
    their original spawn definitions in the database, which is crucial for respawn
    mechanics and world state management.
  warnings: Do not assume that spawn IDs are unique across different maps or zones;
    they are only guaranteed to be unique within the context of a single map instance.
    Also, be aware that some creatures (like those spawned via scripts) may have a
    spawn ID of 0 if they were created without a proper spawn point.
