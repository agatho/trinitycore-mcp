  method: LoadRarePetList
  signature: void BattlePetManager::LoadRarePetList()
documentation:
  brief: Loads the list of rare battle pet IDs into memory for use in pet spawning
    and management.
  description: The LoadRarePetList method initializes and populates an internal data
    structure with the identifiers of rare battle pets. This function is typically
    invoked during server startup or when the battle pet system is initialized to
    ensure that rare pets can be correctly spawned according to game rules and configurations.
    It reads from a database or configuration file containing the list of rare pet
    IDs, validates them, and stores them in a container for fast lookup during gameplay
    events such as pet battles or random pet spawns. The method does not return any
    value but modifies the internal state of the BattlePetManager instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BattlePetManager* manager = sBattlePetMgr;

      manager->LoadRarePetList();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during initialization; subsequent
    calls may result in duplicate entries or undefined behavior. The method assumes
    that the database or configuration source is accessible and properly formatted.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within a hot path or frequently during gameplay,
    as it may cause performance degradation due to potential I/O operations or data
    validation checks.
