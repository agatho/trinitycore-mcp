    uint8 race, uint8 classId, uint8 gender, const std::string & name, int & outGuid,
    std::string & outErrorMsg)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new player character object for the specified account with given
    race, class, gender, and name.
  description: The CreatePlayerObject method is responsible for creating a new player
    character within the TrinityCore database. It validates the provided parameters
    including account ID, race, class, gender, and character name to ensure they meet
    game requirements. The method checks for name uniqueness, valid race/class combinations,
    and account ownership before proceeding with character creation. Upon successful
    creation, it returns the GUID of the newly created character and sets an empty
    error message. If any validation fails or database operations encounter issues,
    appropriate error messages are returned along with a failure result code.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier of the account to which the new character will
      belong. Must correspond to an existing account in the database.
  - name: race
    description: Race identifier for the new character (e.g., Human = 1, Orc = 2,
      etc.). Must be a valid race ID supported by the game.
  - name: classId
    description: Class identifier for the new character (e.g., Warrior = 1, Mage =
      8, etc.). Must be a valid class ID supported by the game.
  - name: gender
    description: Gender of the character (0 = Male, 1 = Female). Must be either 0
      or 1.
  - name: name
    description: Desired name for the new character. Must be unique across all characters
      in the database and follow naming rules (typically 2-12 alphanumeric characters).
  - name: outGuid
    description: Output parameter that will contain the globally unique identifier
      (GUID) of the newly created character upon successful creation.
  - name: outErrorMsg
    description: Output parameter that will contain an error message if character
      creation fails. Will be empty on success.
  returns: Returns a CreateResult enum value indicating whether the operation succeeded
    or failed, along with specific failure reasons such as invalid parameters, name
    conflicts, or database errors.

      \ with GUID: \" << guid << std::endl;\n    break;\ncase CREATE_ERROR_NAME_EXISTS:\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Character name already exists\" << std::endl;\n    break;\n\
      case CREATE_ERROR_INVALID_RACE_CLASS:\n    std::cout << \"Invalid race/class\
      \ combination\" << std::endl;\n    break;\ndefault:\n    std::cout << \"Unknown\
      \ error occurred: \" << errorMsg << std::endl;\n    break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations and should be used carefully in
    performance-critical sections. Character creation involves multiple validation
    steps including checking account ownership, name uniqueness, and race/class compatibility.
    The method is typically called during character creation UI flows or automated
    bot character generation processes.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid parameters as it may lead to database
    corruption or inconsistent state. Ensure the account ID exists before calling
    this method. Character names must be validated for length and allowed characters
    before passing to this function.
