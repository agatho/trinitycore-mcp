documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a strategy instance by its name from the BotAI system
  description: The GetStrategy method retrieves a Strategy object from the BotAI system
    based on the provided strategy name. This method is used to access predefined
    behavior strategies that control how bot characters interact with the game world.
    The returned strategy can be used to configure bot behavior, such as combat tactics,
    movement patterns, or quest completion methods. The method performs a lookup in
    the internal strategy registry and returns a pointer to the requested strategy
    if it exists, or nullptr if no matching strategy is found.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier string name of the strategy to retrieve. This
      corresponds to the strategy's registered name within the BotAI system.
  returns: A pointer to the Strategy object if a strategy with the specified name
    exists, or nullptr if no matching strategy is found. The returned pointer should
    not be deleted by the caller as it is managed by the BotAI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Retrieval
    code: "Strategy* combatStrategy = botAI->GetStrategy(\"combat\");\nif (combatStrategy\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    // Use the combat strategy\n    combatStrategy->Execute(bot);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Strategy Access with Error Handling
    code: "std::string strategyName = \"questing\";\nStrategy* questStrategy = botAI->GetStrategy(strategyName);\n\
      if (questStrategy == nullptr) {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to retrieve\
      \ strategy: {}\", strategyName);\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with using the\
      \ retrieved strategy\nquestStrategy->Initialize(bot);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a string-based lookup in an internal registry, so performance
    may be impacted when called frequently. The returned Strategy pointer is managed
    by the BotAI system and should not be deleted or modified directly. Strategy objects
    are typically registered during system initialization and remain valid throughout
    the bot's lifetime.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid strategy name will return nullptr,
    which must be checked to prevent null pointer dereferences. Avoid storing references
    to returned Strategy pointers across different execution contexts as they may
    become invalid if strategies are reloaded or modified.
