  class: Battleground
  method: GetMinLevel
  signature: int Battleground::GetMinLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum required level for players to join the battleground.
  description: The GetMinLevel method returns the minimum player level required to
    participate in the battleground. This value is typically set during battleground
    creation or configuration and is used by the game client and server to enforce
    level restrictions. The returned level value determines whether a player can queue
    for or join the battleground based on their character's current level. This method
    does not perform any dynamic calculations; it simply returns a pre-defined minimum
    level constraint associated with the battleground instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the minimum level required to join the battleground.
    A value of 0 typically indicates no level restriction, while positive values indicate
    the minimum level needed for participation.
  examples:
  - title: Check Minimum Level Before Joining
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    int minLevel = bg->GetMinLevel();\n    if (minLevel > 0)\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Minimum level to join: %d\", minLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in battleground queue systems and player eligibility
    checks. The returned value should be compared against the player's actual level
    to determine if they meet the requirements for joining.
