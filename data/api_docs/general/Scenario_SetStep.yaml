  class: Scenario
  method: SetStep
  signature: void Scenario::SetStep(const ScenarioStepEntry * step)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the current scenario step to the provided step entry.
  description: The SetStep method updates the active scenario step for a scenario
    instance. This method is typically used during scenario progression to advance
    the scenario state to a specific step defined by the ScenarioStepEntry parameter.
    The method does not validate whether the provided step is valid or within the
    bounds of the scenario's defined steps, so callers should ensure the step entry
    is appropriate for the current scenario context. This method directly modifies
    the internal state of the scenario and may trigger related game events or updates
    depending on how the scenario is implemented.
  parameters:
  - name: step
    description: A pointer to a ScenarioStepEntry object that defines the new step
      to set for this scenario. Must not be null, as passing a null pointer would
      likely cause undefined behavior or crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a scenario step
    code: "Scenario* scenario = player->GetScenario();\nconst ScenarioStepEntry* newStep\
      \ = sScenarioStepStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif (newStep)\n{\n    scenario->SetStep(newStep);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the scenario and may be called
    from various game systems such as quest completion handlers or event triggers.
    It is recommended to ensure that the provided ScenarioStepEntry is valid and corresponds
    to a step within the current scenario's defined steps.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'step' parameter will likely result in
    a crash or undefined behavior. Always validate the input before calling this method.
