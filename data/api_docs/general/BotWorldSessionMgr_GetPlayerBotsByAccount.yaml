  class: BotWorldSessionMgr
  method: GetPlayerBotsByAccount
  signature: int BotWorldSessionMgr::GetPlayerBotsByAccount(uint32 accountId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of player bots associated with a given account ID.
  description: The GetPlayerBotsByAccount method is used to determine how many bot
    characters are currently registered under a specific account in the TrinityCore
    database. This functionality is primarily utilized within the bot management system
    to enforce account-based limits and track bot usage per user. The method performs
    a lookup in the database using the provided account ID and returns a count of
    all active player bots associated with that account. It does not distinguish between
    different types of bots or their specific configurations, but rather provides
    a simple total count for administrative purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of player bots currently registered
    under the specified account ID. Returns zero if no bots are found for the given
    account, or a negative value if an error occurs during database access.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nint botCount = sBotWorldSessionMgr->GetPlayerBotsByAccount(accountId);\n\
      if (botCount >= 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Account %u has %d bots\\n\", accountId,\
      \ botCount);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Error retrieving bot count for account\
      \ %u\\n\", accountId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during session initialization or when checking
    account limits for bot creation. It may involve database queries which could impact
    performance if called frequently in tight loops. The implementation assumes that
    the account ID is valid and exists in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent account ID may result
    in undefined behavior or database errors. Ensure proper validation of account
    IDs before calling this function, especially when dealing with user input.
