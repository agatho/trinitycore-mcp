documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the LFG bot system is currently enabled in the TrinityCore
    server.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the LFG (Looking for Group) bot
    functionality has been activated within the TrinityCore server instance. This
    feature allows automated character creation and group finding for players who
    wish to quickly join dungeons or raids without manual coordination. The method
    returns a boolean value indicating the current operational state of the LFG bot
    manager. It is typically used by other subsystems to verify that bot services
    are available before attempting to utilize them.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the LFG bot system is enabled and active; false otherwise. This
    indicates whether automated group finding and character management features are
    currently operational within the server.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (sLFGBotManager->IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with LFG bot operations\n\
      \    sLFGBotManager->StartBotSession();\n} else {\n    // Handle disabled state\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"LFG Bot system is disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple boolean check and should have minimal performance
    impact. It's recommended to cache the result if checking frequently in performance-critical
    code paths.
