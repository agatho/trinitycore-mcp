  class: HunterAI
  method: HandleInterrupts
  signature: bool HunterAI::HandleInterrupts(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles interrupting spell casts by the hunter's target.
  description: The HandleInterrupts method determines whether the hunter AI should
    attempt to interrupt an enemy's spell casting. It evaluates the current combat
    situation and the target's casting state to decide if an interrupt ability should
    be used. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle to manage
    spell interruption behavior for hunter characters in TrinityCore. The method considers
    factors such as the target's cast time, the hunter's available interrupt abilities,
    and the overall tactical situation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's ID or index. This
      parameter is used to identify which enemy to check for spell casting and potential
      interruption.
  returns: Returns true if the hunter successfully interrupts the target's spell cast,
    false otherwise. The method returns false when no interrupt opportunity is available
    or when the conditions for interruption are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (HandleInterrupts(&m_targetId))\n\
      \    {\n        // Interrupt was successful\n        DoInterruptSpell();\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HandleInterrupts with conditional logic
    code: "bool HunterAI::HandleInterrupts(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target || *target\
      \ <= 0)\n        return false;\n    \n    Unit* pTarget = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*m_creature,\
      \ *target);\n    if (!pTarget || !pTarget->IsInCombat())\n        return false;\n\
      \    \n    // Check if target is casting a spell\n    if (pTarget->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \    {\n        // Perform interrupt logic here\n        return true;\n    }\n\
      \    \n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI behavior system for hunter class in TrinityCore.
    The implementation likely checks against spell mechanics and cooldowns to determine
    valid interrupt opportunities. Developers should ensure proper target validation
    before calling this method.
  warnings: The target parameter must be properly initialized and valid, otherwise
    the method may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate that the target
    exists and is in combat before attempting to interrupt their spell cast.
