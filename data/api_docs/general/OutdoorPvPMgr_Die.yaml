documentation:
  brief: Handles the destruction and cleanup of all active Outdoor PvP zones managed
    by the OutdoorPvPMgr instance.
  description: The Die method is responsible for gracefully shutting down and cleaning
    up all active Outdoor PvP zones that are currently managed by the OutdoorPvPMgr.
    This method ensures that all resources associated with the Outdoor PvP systems
    are properly released, including unregistering event handlers, removing references
    to game objects, and notifying relevant subsystems that the Outdoor PvP functionality
    is being terminated. It's typically called during server shutdown or when the
    OutdoorPvPMgr instance itself is being destroyed. The method does not take any
    parameters and performs no return operations, as its sole purpose is to perform
    cleanup tasks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Server Shutdown Cleanup
    code: "void World::UpdateWorldState()\n{\n    // During server shutdown\n    sOutdoorPvPMgr->Die();\n\
      \    // All Outdoor PvP zones are now cleaned up\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the OutdoorPvPMgr is no longer needed,
    typically during server shutdown or when the manager itself is being destroyed.
    It's important to ensure that no other systems are actively using Outdoor PvP
    zones before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling Die() while Outdoor PvP zones are still in use may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that all Outdoor PvP operations have completed
    or been suspended before invoking this method.
