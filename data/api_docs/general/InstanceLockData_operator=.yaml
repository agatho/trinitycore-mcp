  brief: Moves an InstanceLockData object's resources to another InstanceLockData
    object.
  description: The move assignment operator for InstanceLockData transfers all resources
    from the source object to the target object, leaving the source in a valid but
    unspecified state. This operation is typically used when you want to efficiently
    transfer ownership of instance lock data without performing deep copies. In the
    context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this would be relevant when
    managing player instance locks or dungeon access permissions, where moving the
    lock data avoids unnecessary copying of potentially large internal structures.
    The method ensures that any existing resources in the target object are properly
    cleaned up before the move operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the InstanceLockData object after the move assignment has
    been completed, allowing for chaining of operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'InstanceLockData lock1;

      // ... populate lock1 with data ...

      InstanceLockData lock2 = std::move(lock1); // Uses move assignment operator

      // lock1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Operations
    code: 'InstanceLockData source;

      InstanceLockData target1, target2;

      target1 = std::move(source); // Move to target1

      // Now move from target1 to target2

      target2 = std::move(target1); // Move to target2

      // target1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics standard and is typically
    implemented using swap or direct resource transfer. The source object after a
    move operation should not be used unless it's explicitly reset or reassigned.
    In TrinityCore, this would be particularly useful for performance optimization
    when handling instance lock data that may be frequently transferred between different
    objects or scopes.
  warnings: After calling the move assignment operator, the source object is left
    in a valid but unspecified state. Using the source object after a move operation
    without reinitialization can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure proper initialization
    of moved-from objects if they are to be used again.
