documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the operation type associated with a trait definition effect point
    entry.
  description: The GetOperationType method returns the TraitPointsOperationType enum
    value that defines how the trait points are applied or calculated for a specific
    trait definition effect. This operation type determines whether the points are
    added, multiplied, or otherwise modified in the context of trait systems within
    World of Warcraft. The method is typically used during trait point calculations
    and UI display logic to properly interpret how trait effects should be processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A TraitPointsOperationType enum value indicating the type of operation
    applied to the trait points. Possible values include operations such as addition,
    multiplication, or other mathematical transformations that define how the effect
    points are calculated in relation to trait systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TraitDefinitionEffectPointsEntry* entry = sTraitMgr->GetTraitDefinitionEffectPointsEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    TraitPointsOperationType operation = entry->GetOperationType();\n\
      \    // Use operation type for further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the trait system implementation in TrinityCore and
    should only be called on valid entries retrieved from the trait manager. The returned
    enum value directly influences how trait point calculations are performed in the
    game engine.
