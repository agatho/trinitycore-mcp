  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with a skill line ability entry
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the combined
    flags that define various properties and behaviors of a skill line ability within
    the TrinityCore database. These flags control aspects such as whether the ability
    is affected by spell modifiers, if it's a passive skill, or if it has special
    interaction rules with other game systems. The returned value is a bitmask that
    can be evaluated using bitwise operations to determine specific flag states. This
    method provides access to internal configuration data used by the game engine
    to manage skill line abilities and their interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flags for the skill line ability.
    Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific property or behavior
    flag, allowing bitwise evaluation to determine individual flag states.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a skill is passive
    code: "SkillLineAbilityEntry* entry = sSkillLineAbilityStore.LookupEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & 0x01) //\
      \ Assuming bit 0 indicates passive\n        printf(\"This skill is passive\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Evaluate multiple skill flags
    code: "SkillLineAbilityEntry* entry = sSkillLineAbilityStore.LookupEntry(67890);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & 0x02) printf(\"\
      Affected by spell modifiers\\n\");\n    if (flags & 0x04) printf(\"Has special\
      \ interaction rules\\n\");\n    if (flags & 0x08) printf(\"Is a profession skill\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flag values are defined in the game's database and may vary between different
    TrinityCore versions or custom configurations. Developers should consult the relevant
    database schema or documentation to understand the meaning of specific bit positions.
    The returned value is read-only and represents static data from the skill line
    ability entry.
  warnings: Be cautious when interpreting flag values as they may change between game
    patches or custom server modifications. Always verify flag meanings against current
    database definitions rather than relying on hardcoded assumptions about bit positions.
