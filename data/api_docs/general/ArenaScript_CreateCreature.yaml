  class: ArenaScript
  method: CreateCreature
  signature: int * ArenaScript::CreateCreature(int entry, float x, float y, float
    z, float o) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates a creature in the arena with the specified entry and position.
  description: The CreateCreature method instantiates a new creature within the arena
    environment at the given coordinates. This method is typically used during arena
    match initialization or dynamic creature spawning during gameplay. The creature
    is created with the specified entry ID, which determines its type, stats, and
    behavior. The method returns a pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier
    (GUID) of the newly created creature. The position parameters (x, y, z) define
    where the creature will be spawned in the arena, while the orientation parameter
    'o' sets the creature's facing direction. This method is part of the ArenaScript
    class and is designed to work within the context of TrinityCore's arena system.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID that defines the type, model, stats, and behavior
      of the creature to be created. This ID must correspond to a valid creature template
      in the database.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate where the creature will be spawned within the arena
      environment.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate where the creature will be spawned within the arena
      environment.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate (height) where the creature will be spawned within
      the arena environment.
  - name: o
    description: The orientation angle (in radians) determining the direction the
      creature will face upon creation.
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    created creature. Returns NULL if the creature creation fails due to invalid parameters
    or system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Creation
    code: "int* guid = arenaScript->CreateCreature(12345, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f,\
      \ 0.0f);\nif (guid != nullptr) {\n    // Use the creature GUID for further operations\n\
      \    printf(\"Created creature with GUID: %d\\n\", *guid);\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to create creature\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Creatures
    code: "int* player1 = arenaScript->CreateCreature(12345, 50.0f, 50.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);\n\
      int* player2 = arenaScript->CreateCreature(12346, -50.0f, -50.0f, 0.0f, 3.14f);\n\
      if (player1 != nullptr && player2 != nullptr) {\n    // Both creatures created\
      \ successfully\n    printf(\"Player 1 GUID: %d, Player 2 GUID: %d\\n\", *player1,\
      \ *player2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called within the context of an active arena match.
    The returned integer pointer must be managed carefully to avoid memory leaks or
    dangling pointers. Creature creation is subject to arena resource limits and may
    fail if system constraints are exceeded.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid entry IDs or coordinates outside the
    arena boundaries may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate parameters
    before calling this method. The returned pointer should not be freed manually
    as it's managed by the arena system.
