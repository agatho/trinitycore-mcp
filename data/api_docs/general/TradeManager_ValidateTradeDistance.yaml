  class: TradeManager
  method: ValidateTradeDistance
  signature: bool TradeManager::ValidateTradeDistance(Player * trader) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the trading player is within the required distance for
    initiating a trade.
  description: The ValidateTradeDistance method checks if the specified player is
    within the acceptable range to perform a trade with another player. This validation
    ensures that players cannot trade across large distances, maintaining game balance
    and preventing exploitation. The method typically verifies the distance between
    the trading player and their trading partner using the game's internal distance
    calculation system. It returns true if the distance is valid for trading, false
    otherwise. This check is usually performed before allowing a trade to proceed
    in the game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: trader
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player attempting to
      initiate a trade. Must be a valid player instance.
  returns: Returns true if the trader is within the valid trading distance of their
    trading partner, false otherwise. A return value of false typically prevents the
    trade from being initiated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Distance Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nif (TradeManager::ValidateTradeDistance(player))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with trade initiation\n    // ...\n} else {\n    // Send\
      \ error message to player\n    player->SendTradeError(TRADE_ERROR_TOO_FAR_AWAY);\n\
      }"

  notes: This method likely uses the game's built-in distance checking functions and
    may consider factors such as map boundaries, instance restrictions, and player
    movement state. The exact distance threshold is determined by the game's configuration
    and may vary between different World of Warcraft versions or custom server configurations.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null before calling. Calling this method with an invalid player reference could
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes in the game server.
