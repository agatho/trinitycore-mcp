  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: SelectActionBasedOnPattern
  signature: std::string PlayerPatternRecognition::SelectActionBasedOnPattern(Player
    * bot, const PlayerProfile & pattern)
documentation:
  brief: Selects an appropriate action for a bot player based on a predefined pattern
    profile.
  description: The SelectActionBasedOnPattern method evaluates the provided PlayerProfile
    to determine and return the most suitable action for a given bot player. This
    method is typically used in AI-driven gameplay logic where bots need to make decisions
    based on behavioral patterns, such as combat strategies, movement tactics, or
    interaction sequences. The method analyzes the pattern data and returns a string
    identifier representing the chosen action. It assumes that the input PlayerProfile
    contains valid pattern data and that the bot player is properly initialized for
    decision-making.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the selected action. Must not be null.
  - name: pattern
    description: A constant reference to a PlayerProfile object containing behavioral
      or tactical patterns used to determine the appropriate action. The profile should
      contain valid data for pattern matching.
  returns: A std::string representing the identifier of the selected action based
    on the provided pattern. Returns an empty string if no suitable action is found
    or in case of invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SelectActionBasedOnPattern
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Initialized bot player\nPlayerProfile profile =\
      \ ...; // Predefined pattern profile\nstd::string action = PlayerPatternRecognition::SelectActionBasedOnPattern(myBot,\
      \ profile);\nif (!action.empty()) {\n    // Execute the selected action\n  \
      \  std::cout << \"Selected action: \" << action << std::endl;\n} else {\n  \
      \  std::cout << \"No valid action found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger AI decision-making framework and relies on
    the integrity of both the bot player object and the pattern profile. The implementation
    may involve complex pattern matching algorithms or lookup tables depending on
    how PlayerProfile is structured internally.
  warnings: Ensure that the PlayerProfile passed to this method contains valid data;
    otherwise, unexpected behavior or empty return values may occur. Also, calling
    this method with a null bot pointer will likely result in undefined behavior.
