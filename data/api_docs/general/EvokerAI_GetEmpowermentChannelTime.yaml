api:
  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetEmpowermentChannelTime
  signature: int EvokerAI::GetEmpowermentChannelTime(EmpowermentLevel level)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the channel time duration for a specified empowerment level.
  description: The GetEmpowermentChannelTime method retrieves the channel time in
    milliseconds associated with a given EmpowermentLevel. This value determines how
    long an evoker must channel their spell to achieve a specific empowerment state.
    The method is typically used within the EvokerAI class to manage spell casting
    behavior and timing logic. It ensures that the correct channel duration is applied
    based on the current empowerment level, which affects spell damage and effects.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The EmpowermentLevel enum value indicating the current empowerment
      state. Valid values are typically EMBER, BLOOD, FROST, and UNDEAD, representing
      different empowerment states that modify spell behavior.
  returns: An integer representing the channel time in milliseconds for the specified
    empowerment level. Returns 0 if the empowerment level is invalid or not supported.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int channelTime = evokerAI->GetEmpowermentChannelTime(EMBER);

      // Returns the channel time for Ember empowerment state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Spell Logic
    code: "if (player->HasAuraType(SPELL_AURA_CHANNEL_DEATH))\n{\n    int time = evokerAI->GetEmpowermentChannelTime(BLOOD);\n\
      \    // Use time to adjust spell duration or effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Evoker's AI system and directly influences spell
    casting behavior. The returned channel times are usually defined in the game's
    configuration files or hardcoded values based on class design. Ensure that the
    EmpowermentLevel enum values match those expected by the implementation.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the empowerment level is
    valid, as invalid inputs may return unexpected results. This method should only
    be used during active spell channeling or state management operations.
