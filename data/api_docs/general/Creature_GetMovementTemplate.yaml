  class: Creature
  method: GetMovementTemplate
  signature: const CreatureMovementData & Creature::GetMovementTemplate() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement template data for the creature, including its movement
    type and associated parameters.
  description: The GetMovementTemplate method retrieves the CreatureMovementData structure
    that defines how the creature moves within the game world. This includes information
    about the creature's movement type, such as walk, run, or fly, along with associated
    parameters like speed, waypoints, and other movement-related data. The method
    is essential for understanding a creature's behavior in terms of movement patterns
    and is commonly used in AI scripts and pathfinding implementations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to the CreatureMovementData structure which contains
    all movement-related parameters for this specific creature instance, including
    movement type, speed values, and waypoint information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      const CreatureMovementData& movementData = creature->GetMovementTemplate();

      // Use movementData to determine creature''s movement behavior'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nif (creature->GetMovementTemplate().MovementType\
      \ == MOVEMENT_TYPE_WALK)\n{\n    // Handle walking movement\n}\nelse if (creature->GetMovementTemplate().MovementType\
      \ == MOVEMENT_TYPE_RUN)\n{\n    // Handle running movement\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a const reference to avoid unnecessary copying of data.
    This is important for performance in high-frequency operations. The returned data
    is typically set during creature creation and remains constant throughout its
    lifetime.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in AI scripts, as modifying the returned
    data may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if not handled carefully. Also,
    ensure that the creature's movement type is properly initialized before calling
    this method.
