documentation:
  brief: Constructs and returns a formatted calendar mail subject string for a calendar
    event.
  description: The BuildCalendarMailSubject method generates a standardized subject
    line for calendar-related emails sent to players. This method is typically used
    when notifying participants of calendar events, such as invitations, updates,
    or cancellations. The generated subject includes relevant information about the
    event and the player who performed an action (like removing an invite). It uses
    internal event data and the remover's ID to format a user-friendly message that
    appears in the player's mailbox. This method is part of the calendar system implementation
    within TrinityCore's game framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the formatted calendar mail subject, which includes
    event details and the remover's identifier in a standardized format suitable for
    display in the player's mailbox.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      // Assume event is properly initialized

      std::string subject = event.BuildCalendarMailSubject(12345);

      // Returns a formatted string like "Calendar Event: [Event Name] - Removed by
      Player ID 12345"'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the calendar system when sending
    notifications. The remover parameter represents the GUID of the player who performed
    an action on the event, such as removing another player from an invitation. It's
    important to note that this method does not perform any validation on the remover
    ID; it simply formats it into the subject string.
