  signature: void SocialManager::StartPerformanceTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the performance timer for social network operations within the
    SocialManager.
  description: The StartPerformanceTimer method initializes a performance monitoring
    timer used to track the execution time of various social network-related operations
    within the SocialManager class. This timer is typically employed to measure the
    efficiency of social interactions such as friend list processing, guild communications,
    or chat message handling. The method sets up internal timing mechanisms that can
    be used later to calculate elapsed time for specific social operations. It is
    generally called before performing time-sensitive social actions to ensure accurate
    performance metrics are collected.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->StartPerformanceTimer();

      // Perform some social operations

      // Timer will be used to measure execution time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely initializes internal timing variables and may be part
    of a larger performance monitoring system. The timer should be started before
    any social operation that requires timing measurement, and it's recommended to
    pair this with a corresponding StopPerformanceTimer() call for accurate measurements.
