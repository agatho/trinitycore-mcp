  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: UpdateEventParticipation
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::UpdateEventParticipation(uint32 playerGuid,
    uint32 eventId, bool wasOrganizer)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the participation status of a player in a guild event, tracking whether
    they were an organizer or regular participant.
  description: The UpdateEventParticipation method is responsible for maintaining
    accurate records of player involvement in guild events within the TrinityCore
    framework. It updates internal data structures to reflect whether a specific player
    (identified by their GUID) participated in a particular guild event, and whether
    that player acted as an organizer for the event. This method likely integrates
    with the guild event system to ensure proper tracking of event attendance, organizer
    status, and related rewards or achievements. The method is typically invoked when
    a player joins or leaves a guild event, or when their role within the event changes
    from participant to organizer or vice versa.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose participation status
      needs to be updated. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game
      database.
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event for which the player's participation
      is being updated. This ID should reference an existing guild event within the
      system.
  - name: wasOrganizer
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player was acting as an organizer
      for the event. True if the player was an organizer, false if they were a regular
      participant.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage - Update Player Participation
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateEventParticipation(123456, 7890, true); // Player with GUID
      123456 is organizer of event 7890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update Regular Participant Status
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateEventParticipation(987654, 54321, false); // Player with GUID
      987654 is participant of event 54321'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild event tracking systems and
    may update database records or in-memory caches. It's important to ensure that
    the playerGuid and eventId parameters correspond to valid entities in the game
    world, as invalid values could lead to data inconsistency or errors. The method
    may also trigger additional logic such as updating achievement progress or notifying
    other subsystems about event participation changes.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid player GUIDs or event IDs can result
    in undefined behavior or database corruption. Ensure that all parameters are validated
    before calling this method, especially in high-frequency scenarios where multiple
    events might be processed simultaneously.
