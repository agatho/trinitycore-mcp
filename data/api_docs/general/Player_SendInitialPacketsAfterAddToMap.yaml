documentation:
  brief: Sends initial packets to player after adding to map
  description: This method sends all initial network packets required for a player
    to properly initialize their client connection when added to a game world map.
    It typically includes sending the player's character data, inventory items, quest
    information, and other essential packets that establish the player's connection
    state in the game world. The method is called automatically during player initialization
    and ensures that all necessary data is transmitted before the player becomes active
    in the world.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Player::SendInitialPacketsAfterAddToMap() {\n    // Implementation\
      \ details\n}\n\n// Called automatically during player initialization\nPlayer*\
      \ player = new Player();\nplayer->AddToWorld();\nplayer->SendInitialPacketsAfterAddToMap();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    player initialization. It may involve sending multiple packets including character
    data, inventory items, quest information, and other essential game state data.
    The method should not be called directly by developers unless specifically required
    for custom implementation.
  warnings: This method should not be called manually by developers unless implementing
    custom player initialization logic. Calling it at the wrong time may result in
    incomplete or corrupted client data packets being sent to the player.
