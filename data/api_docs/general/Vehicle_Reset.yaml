  class: Vehicle
  method: Reset
  signature: void Vehicle::Reset(bool evading)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the vehicle's state, clearing any active passengers and resetting
    its current mode.
  description: The Reset method is used to return a Vehicle object to its default
    state. This includes removing all currently seated passengers, clearing any active
    boarding or exiting processes, and resetting internal state flags that control
    the vehicle's behavior. The method optionally accepts an 'evading' parameter which
    may influence how the reset process handles certain edge cases such as passenger
    removal during combat or escape scenarios. This function is typically invoked
    when a vehicle needs to be reinitialized after an event like a battle, teleportation,
    or server-side state change.
  parameters:
  - name: evading
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the reset should handle passenger
      removal in an evasive manner. When true, the method may prioritize removing
      passengers more quickly or with special handling during combat or escape situations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Reset
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    vehicle->Reset(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset with Evasion Handling
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    vehicle->Reset(true);\
      \ // Force evasive reset during combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    manage vehicle lifecycle events. It ensures that all passengers are properly removed
    and that the vehicle's internal state is consistent before being reused or destroyed.
    The 'evading' parameter is particularly relevant in PvP or combat scenarios where
    immediate passenger removal might be necessary.
  warnings: Calling Reset on a vehicle while it is actively engaged in movement or
    combat may lead to inconsistent states if not handled carefully. Always ensure
    that the vehicle is in a stable state before invoking this method.
