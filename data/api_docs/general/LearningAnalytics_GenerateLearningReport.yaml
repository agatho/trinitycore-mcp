api:
  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: GenerateLearningReport
  signature: std::string LearningAnalytics::GenerateLearningReport(uint32_t botGuid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a detailed learning analytics report for a specified bot GUID.
  description: The GenerateLearningReport method produces a structured string-based
    report containing learning metrics and performance data for a specific bot identified
    by its GUID. This functionality is typically used in automated testing or training
    environments within the TrinityCore framework to analyze how bots learn and adapt
    over time. The method does not modify any internal state and is designed to be
    thread-safe when called from multiple contexts. It assumes that the provided bot
    GUID corresponds to an existing bot entity within the system.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the learning report
      is generated. Must correspond to a valid bot entity in the system.
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted learning analytics report for the
    specified bot. The format may include performance metrics, training progress,
    skill levels, and other relevant data points related to the bot's learning behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      std::string report = analytics.GenerateLearningReport(botGuid);

      std::cout << report << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a Loop for Multiple Bots
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32_t guid\
      \ : botGuids) {\n    std::string report = analytics.GenerateLearningReport(guid);\n\
      \    // Process or log the report\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking mechanisms for bot learning data.
    Ensure that the bot GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an active bot instance;
    otherwise, the output may be empty or malformed.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or non-existent bot GUIDs as it might
    lead to undefined behavior or return empty reports. Also, consider performance
    implications if used in high-frequency scenarios due to potential data serialization
    overhead.
