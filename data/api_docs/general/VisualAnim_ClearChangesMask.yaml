  method: ClearChangesMask
  signature: void VisualAnim::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the visual animation, resetting its modified state
    flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a VisualAnim
    object, effectively clearing any pending modifications or dirty flags that indicate
    the animation has been altered. This is typically used during synchronization
    processes where the system needs to know which properties of the animation have
    changed since the last update. The method ensures that subsequent checks for changes
    will not report previously modified state as new changes. It's commonly invoked
    when sending updates to clients or resetting internal tracking states in preparation
    for new operations.

  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Synchronization
    code: 'VisualAnim* anim = player->GetVisualAnim();

      anim->ClearChangesMask();

      // Animation state is now considered clean for next sync cycle'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after processing changes to avoid repeated notifications
    of the same modifications. It's part of the animation state management system
    and works in conjunction with other mask-based methods like SetChangesMask or
    HasChangesMask.
