  method: DisablePetControlsOnMount
  signature: void Player::DisablePetControlsOnMount(int reactState, int commandState)
documentation:
  brief: Disables pet controls when the player is mounted.
  description: This method disables pet control commands when a player is mounted,
    preventing pets from following or attacking while the player is in a mounted state.
    The method takes two integer parameters representing react state and command state
    to determine how pet behavior should be handled during mount. It is used primarily
    in conjunction with mount mechanics to ensure proper gameplay balance and prevent
    pets from interfering with player movement during mount.
  parameters:
  - name: reactState
    description: The reaction state of the pet controls, typically indicating whether
      the pet should follow or attack during mount. Valid values are 0 (no reaction),
      1 (follow), or 2 (attack).
  - name: commandState
    description: The command state for pet controls, determining whether the pet should
      be controlled or not. Valid values are 0 (disabled), 1 (enabled), or 2 (default).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->DisablePetControlsOnMount(1, 0);

      // This disables pet following behavior when mounted'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: The method likely involves setting internal flags
    or states within the player object to control pet behavior during mount. Performance
    considerations: This method should be called only when necessary as it may affect
    gameplay balance and could potentially cause issues if not used correctly.'
  warnings: This method may interfere with normal gameplay if not used properly, particularly
    in scenarios where pets are expected to follow or attack during mount. Common
    mistakes include using incorrect values for reactState or commandState which can
    lead to unexpected pet behavior.
