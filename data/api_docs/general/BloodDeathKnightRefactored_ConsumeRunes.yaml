  signature: void BloodDeathKnightRefactored::ConsumeRunes(int type, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes specified runes of a given type for the Blood Death Knight
  description: The ConsumeRunes method is responsible for depleting a specified number
    of runes of a particular type from the Blood Death Knight's rune pool. This method
    is typically invoked when abilities or spells that require rune consumption are
    executed. The 'type' parameter determines which rune type (e.g., blood, frost,
    unholy) to consume, while the 'count' parameter specifies how many runes of that
    type should be consumed. This functionality is integral to the Death Knight's
    resource management system and ensures proper cooldowns and ability usage mechanics
    within the game.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: Specifies the rune type to consume. Valid values are typically 0
      for blood, 1 for frost, and 2 for unholy runes. The exact mapping may depend
      on internal TrinityCore implementation.
  - name: count
    description: The number of runes of the specified type to consume. Must be a non-negative
      integer. If count exceeds available runes, behavior is implementation-defined
      but typically results in no consumption or partial consumption.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consume 1 Blood Rune
    code: 'BloodDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      dk->ConsumeRunes(0, 1); // Consume 1 blood rune'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consume Multiple Frost Runes
    code: 'BloodDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      dk->ConsumeRunes(1, 3); // Consume 3 frost runes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal rune system and may update
    cooldown timers or trigger visual effects. It is expected to be called only when
    the Death Knight has sufficient runes of the specified type, though implementation
    details regarding overflow or underflow behavior are not specified.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying rune availability may result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the 'count' parameter does not exceed available
    runes, especially in scenarios where multiple abilities might be triggered simultaneously.
