  method: AdjustStrategyBasedOnScore
  signature: void BattlegroundAI::AdjustStrategyBasedOnScore(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the battleground AI strategy based on current player scores and game
    state.
  description: The AdjustStrategyBasedOnScore method modifies the AI behavior of a
    battleground instance according to the current score distribution among players.
    This method is typically invoked during battleground updates to dynamically adapt
    strategies such as resource allocation, target prioritization, or tactical positioning.
    It evaluates the score differences between teams and adjusts the AI's decision-making
    process accordingly. The method may influence how NPCs behave, what objectives
    are prioritized, and how the overall battle strategy evolves throughout the match.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      whose score is being evaluated for strategy adjustment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground update loop
    code: "void BattlegroundAV::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_PLAYERS; ++i)\n    {\n        m_ai->AdjustStrategyBasedOnScore(&i);\n\
      \    }\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the dynamic battleground AI system and should be called
    regularly during battleground updates to ensure responsive strategy adjustments.
    It relies on accurate score tracking within the battleground instance.
