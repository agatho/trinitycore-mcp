  class: World
  method: GetDataPath
  signature: const std::string & World::GetDataPath() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the data directory path used by the World instance for loading game
    resources.
  description: The GetDataPath method retrieves the absolute path to the data directory
    where the World instance looks for game assets such as maps, scripts, and configuration
    files. This path is typically set during server initialization and determines
    the root location from which all game data is loaded. The returned string represents
    a valid filesystem path that can be used to construct full file paths for accessing
    game resources. This method is essential for systems that need to dynamically
    locate or reference game data files at runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the absolute path to the
    World's data directory. The string will always be valid and represent a readable
    directory path on the filesystem.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::string dataPath = sWorld->GetDataPath();

      std::cout << "Data directory: " << dataPath << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Constructing File Paths
    code: 'const std::string& dataPath = sWorld->GetDataPath();

      std::string mapFilePath = dataPath + "/maps/0_0_0.map";

      // Use mapFilePath to load or access map data'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned path is initialized during server startup and remains constant
    throughout the server's runtime. This method is thread-safe as it only returns
    a cached value without performing any modifications. The path typically points
    to the 'Data' directory relative to the server executable or is configured via
    command-line arguments or configuration files.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned string as it's a const reference. Modifying
    it would lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the data directory exists and
    is readable before attempting to access files within it.
