documentation:
  brief: Returns the event ID associated with the quest.
  description: This method retrieves the unique event identifier that is linked to
    a specific quest within the TrinityCore framework. The event ID typically corresponds
    to a specific quest event or trigger in the game world, such as a quest completion,
    quest start, or quest-related event. It is commonly used for identifying and managing
    quest-related events in the database or during quest handling. This method is
    part of the Quest class and provides access to the event ID without modifying
    any data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the event ID as a uint16 value, which represents a unique identifier
    for the quest event. This value can be used to identify specific events in the
    game world or database, such as quest completion triggers or event-related actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint16 eventId = quest->GetEventIdForQuest();
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to be thread-safe and does not modify any internal
    state. It simply retrieves the event ID from the quest object, making it suitable
    for use in both single-threaded and multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: This method should only be used when the quest object has been properly
    initialized with valid event data. If the quest is not correctly loaded or initialized,
    this method may return an invalid event ID value.
