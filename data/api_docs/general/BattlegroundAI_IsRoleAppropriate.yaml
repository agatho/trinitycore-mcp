  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: IsRoleAppropriate
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::IsRoleAppropriate(int * player, BGRole role) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a player's role is appropriate for the current battleground.
  description: The IsRoleAppropriate method evaluates whether a given player's assigned
    role is suitable for the current battleground instance. This method is typically
    used during battleground matchmaking and role assignment to ensure players are
    placed in roles that align with their capabilities and the battleground's requirements.
    It considers factors such as player class, level, and available role slots to
    make this determination. The method returns true if the role is appropriate, false
    otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose role suitability is being evaluated.
      This parameter represents the specific player instance for which the role check
      is performed.
  - name: role
    description: The BGRole enum value representing the role being checked for appropriateness.
      Valid values include various battleground roles such as TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE,
      etc., depending on the battleground type and current needs.
  returns: Returns true if the player's role is appropriate for the current battleground
    conditions, false otherwise. The method may return false when a player's class
    or level doesn't meet the requirements for the specified role, or when the role
    is already filled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Check
    code: "if (bgAI->IsRoleAppropriate(&player, BGRole::TANK)) {\n    // Player can\
      \ take on tank role\n    printf(\"Player is suitable for tank role\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Player cannot take on tank role\n    printf(\"Player is not\
      \ suitable for tank role\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Assignment Logic
    code: "BGRole assignedRole = BGRole::DAMAGE;\nif (!bgAI->IsRoleAppropriate(&player,\
      \ assignedRole)) {\n    // Find alternative role\n    assignedRole = BGRole::HEALER;\n\
      \    if (bgAI->IsRoleAppropriate(&player, assignedRole)) {\n        printf(\"\
      Player assigned to healer role\\n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against player statistics and
    battleground requirements. It may be called during battleground initialization
    or role reassignment processes. The implementation might cache results for performance
    optimization.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters. Passing null pointers or invalid
    BGRole values may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is
    properly initialized before calling this method.
