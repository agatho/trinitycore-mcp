  signature: const int * DB2Manager::GetQuestsForQuestLine(uint32 questLineId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an array of quest IDs associated with a specified quest line ID.
  description: The GetQuestsForQuestLine method fetches all quest identifiers that
    belong to a given quest line. This is useful for determining which quests are
    part of a specific quest chain or storyline in World of Warcraft. The returned
    pointer points to an array of integers, where each integer represents a quest
    ID. The array is managed internally by the DB2Manager and should not be modified
    or freed by the caller. The method performs a lookup based on the quest line identifier
    provided as input.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers representing the quest IDs associated
    with the specified quest line ID. Returns NULL if no quests are found for the
    given quest line ID or if the quest line does not exist.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through quests in a quest line
    code: "const int* quests = sDB2Manager->GetQuestsForQuestLine(12345);\nif (quests\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; quests[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"\
      Quest ID: %d\\n\", quests[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that quest line data is already loaded into memory. The
    returned array is null-terminated, meaning the last element in the array will
    be zero to indicate the end of the list. This function is typically used for quest
    chain traversal and UI display purposes.
  warnings: Do not modify or free the returned pointer as it points to internal data
    managed by DB2Manager. Ensure that the questLineId passed is valid, otherwise
    the method may return NULL without indicating an error condition.
