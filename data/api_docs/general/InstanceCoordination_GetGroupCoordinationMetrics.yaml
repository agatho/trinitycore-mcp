  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: GetGroupCoordinationMetrics
  signature: CoordinationMetrics InstanceCoordination::GetGroupCoordinationMetrics(uint32
    groupId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves coordination metrics for a specified group within the instance.
  description: The GetGroupCoordinationMetrics method fetches detailed performance
    and synchronization data related to a specific group's coordination within an
    instance. This includes information about group member synchronization, instance
    timing, and potential bottlenecks or delays in group activities. The method is
    typically used for monitoring and debugging purposes to ensure optimal group performance
    during instance encounters. It requires a valid group identifier to retrieve meaningful
    metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a CoordinationMetrics object containing detailed information about
    the group's coordination within the instance, including synchronization status,
    timing data, and performance indicators.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Group Coordination Metrics
    code: "CoordinationMetrics metrics = instanceCoordination->GetGroupCoordinationMetrics(12345);\n\
      if (metrics.IsValid()) {\n    // Process the coordination metrics\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Group synchronization status: \" << metrics.GetSyncStatus() << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications if called frequently, as it
    aggregates data from multiple sources within the instance. The returned CoordinationMetrics
    object should be checked for validity before accessing its members.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent group ID may result
    in undefined behavior or return invalid metrics. Always validate the groupId parameter
    before invoking this method.
