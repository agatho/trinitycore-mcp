    access to skill information without modifying it. This function is commonly used
    in skill calculation logic or when determining skill advancement status.
  parameters: []

    progression level. If the skill is not found or invalid, the method returns 0.

    data. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with invalid skill IDs, as it may return
    0 instead of throwing an error. Also, ensure that the skill ID passed is valid
