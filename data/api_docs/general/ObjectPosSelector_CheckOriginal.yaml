  method: CheckOriginal
  signature: bool ObjectPosSelector::CheckOriginal() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the original position is valid and available for use in object
    placement calculations.
  description: The CheckOriginal method evaluates whether the initial or 'original'
    position within an ObjectPosSelector instance has been properly initialized and
    is suitable for use in positioning calculations. This method typically ensures
    that no conflicting placements exist at the starting point, and that the selector's
    internal state allows for valid object positioning. It is commonly used during
    pathfinding or area-of-effect spell placement logic where the system needs to
    validate a candidate spawn or placement location before proceeding with further
    calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the original position is valid and available for use; otherwise
    returns false. A return value of false typically indicates that the position was
    either not set, is already occupied, or conflicts with existing placements in
    the selector's context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to validate original position
    code: "ObjectPosSelector selector;\n// Assume selector has been initialized with\
      \ some parameters\nif (selector.CheckOriginal()) {\n    // Proceed with object\
      \ placement logic\n    printf(\"Original position is valid\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle invalid original position case\n    printf(\"Original position\
      \ is not valid\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with other ObjectPosSelector methods
    like Initialize(), AddArea(), and Select() to manage object placement in complex
    scenarios such as AoE spell effects or creature spawning. The method may perform
    internal checks against occupied cells, collision detection, or spatial constraints
    depending on the implementation details.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid return value from CheckOriginal() guarantees
    successful placement of an object; additional validation or selection steps might
    still be required. Also, calling this method without prior initialization of the
    selector may lead to undefined behavior.
