  signature: int EarthShieldTracker::GetEarthShieldTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the target GUID of the Earth Shield effect.
  description: The GetEarthShieldTarget method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the creature or player that currently has the Earth Shield buff applied. This
    method is typically used in conjunction with the EarthShieldTracker class to manage
    and track Earth Shield effects on units within the game world. The returned value
    represents the target of the shield, which can be a player, NPC, or any other
    unit that is protected by the Earth Shield spell.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the unit targeted by the Earth Shield
    effect. Returns 0 if no valid target exists or if the Earth Shield is not active
    on any unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int targetGuid = earthShieldTracker.GetEarthShieldTarget();\nif (targetGuid\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Earth Shield is active on a valid target\n    Unit* target\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*m_player, targetGuid);\n    if (target)\n    {\n\
      \        // Process the shield target\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the EarthShieldTracker instance has been properly
    initialized and that the tracker is actively monitoring Earth Shield effects.
    The returned GUID should be validated before use to ensure it points to a valid
    unit in the game world.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without checking if the returned GUID
    is valid, as attempting to access an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the tracker is properly updated with current Earth Shield
    data before calling this method.
