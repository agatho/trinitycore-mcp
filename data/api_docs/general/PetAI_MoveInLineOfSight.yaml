  class: PetAI
  method: MoveInLineOfSight
  signature: void PetAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles line-of-sight detection for pet AI behavior, triggering awareness
    and response actions when targets enter the pet's vision.
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight method in PetAI is responsible for detecting
    when a target enters the pet's line of sight. This method is typically invoked
    by the core game engine when an entity moves into the pet's visual range. It triggers
    various AI behaviors such as aggro detection, targeting, and combat initiation.
    The method evaluates whether the detected unit is a valid target based on faction,
    threat level, and other criteria. It also updates the pet's current target and
    may initiate movement or attack actions depending on the pet's AI state and configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that likely represents a unit or
      entity identifier in the game world. This parameter is used internally by the
      AI system to determine which target has entered line of sight.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in pet AI context
    code: "void PetAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int* unitId)\n{\n    if (unitId && *unitId\
      \ != 0)\n    {\n        Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*unitId);\n \
      \       if (target && CanAttack(target))\n        {\n            AttackStart(target);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI system and is automatically called by
    the TrinityCore engine during movement updates. Developers should not directly
    call this method unless implementing custom pet AI behaviors. The method assumes
    that the input parameter points to a valid game object identifier.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the unitId parameter may lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always validate that the pointer is not null and that the referenced
    entity exists before performing operations on it. This method should only be overridden
    in specialized AI implementations.
