  class: EquipmentManager
  method: UpdatePlayerStatPriority
  signature: void EquipmentManager::UpdatePlayerStatPriority(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's stat priority based on equipped items and current gear
    configuration.
  description: The UpdatePlayerStatPriority method recalculates and applies the optimal
    stat priority for a player character, taking into account all currently equipped
    items and their associated stat bonuses. This method is typically invoked when
    equipment changes occur, such as when items are equipped, unequipped, or modified.
    It ensures that the player's effective stats are accurately reflected in the game's
    internal systems, which may influence combat performance, spell casting, and other
    gameplay mechanics. The method operates on a provided player reference and updates
    relevant stat-related fields within the player's data structure.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      or internal index in the game world. This parameter is used to locate and update
      the specific player's stat priority settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Stat Priority for a Player
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      EquipmentManager::UpdatePlayerStatPriority(&playerId);

      // This updates the stat priority for player with ID 12345 based on current
      equipment.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a player's equipment changes to ensure
    accurate stat calculation. It may trigger additional recalculations of derived
    stats such as attack power, spell damage, or defense ratings depending on the
    item types equipped.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This function does not validate
    equipment state; it assumes all items are properly configured.
