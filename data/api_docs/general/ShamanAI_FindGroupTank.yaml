  signature: int * ShamanAI::FindGroupTank(int * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a pointer to the group tank in the current group.
  description: The FindGroupTank method identifies and retrieves a pointer to the
    group tank within the current player's group. This method is typically used by
    ShamanAI to determine which player is designated as the primary tank for the group,
    allowing the shaman to make appropriate decisions regarding defensive abilities,
    healing priorities, and threat management. The method operates on the assumption
    that there is a valid group with at least one tank present. It returns a pointer
    to an integer representing the GUID of the tank or nullptr if no suitable tank
    is found. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper group dynamics
    and ensuring that the shaman's AI behaves appropriately in both solo and group
    scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the group tank, or nullptr
    if no tank is found in the current group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ShamanAI* shamanAI = static_cast<ShamanAI*>(player->GetAI());\nint* tankGUID\
      \ = shamanAI->FindGroupTank();\nif (tankGUID != nullptr) {\n    // Use the tank\
      \ GUID for further processing\n    uint64 tankId = *tankGUID;\n    // Example:\
      \ Apply defensive cooldowns or healing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the group's internal tank tracking system. It is important
    to verify that the player is in a group before calling this method to avoid unexpected
    behavior. The returned pointer points to an internal value and should not be modified
    directly.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned GUID will always point to a valid player
    object. Always validate the GUID against the current world state before using
    it for actions such as targeting or casting spells.
