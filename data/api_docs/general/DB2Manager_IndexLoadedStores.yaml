documentation:
  brief: Initializes and builds internal indexes for all loaded DB2 data stores within
    the TrinityCore database manager.
  description: The IndexLoadedStores method is responsible for constructing and populating
    internal indexing structures for all DB2 (Database 2) data files that have been
    previously loaded into memory by the DB2Manager. This method ensures that subsequent
    lookups, queries, and access patterns against these data stores are optimized
    through efficient indexing mechanisms. It typically runs during server initialization
    or after loading new DB2 files to make sure all data is properly indexed for fast
    retrieval. The method does not accept any parameters and performs no direct return
    operations, instead modifying internal state of the manager instance. This process
    is critical for performance in World of Warcraft server environments where rapid
    access to game data such as item templates, creature information, and other static
    game assets is required.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Startup
    code: "void InitializeDatabase()\n{\n    // Assume DB2Manager instance exists\n\
      \    sDB2Manager->IndexLoadedStores();\n    // All loaded DB2 stores are now\
      \ indexed for fast access\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after all necessary DB2 files have been
    loaded into the manager. It is typically invoked automatically during server startup
    sequence but can also be manually triggered if new DB2 data has been dynamically
    loaded. The indexing process may take some time depending on the number and size
    of loaded DB2 files, so it's recommended to call this method during low-traffic
    periods or initialization phases.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without reloading the underlying DB2
    data may lead to inconsistent or duplicate index entries. Avoid calling this method
    while other threads are actively querying the DB2 stores to prevent race conditions
    and potential data corruption.
