  class: SmartAIMgr
  method: IsMinMaxValid
  signature: bool SmartAIMgr::IsMinMaxValid(const SmartScriptHolder & e, uint32 min,
    uint32 max)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the given minimum and maximum values are properly configured
    for a SmartAI script event.
  description: The IsMinMaxValid method checks if the provided minimum and maximum
    values in a SmartScriptHolder structure are valid for use within the SmartAI system.
    This validation ensures that the min value is not greater than the max value,
    and that both values meet the requirements for the specific AI event type. The
    method is typically used internally by the SmartAIMgr to prevent invalid configuration
    of AI behaviors. It helps maintain data integrity in the AI scripting system by
    rejecting malformed or logically inconsistent parameters before they are processed
    further.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder structure containing the AI script
      event data and its associated parameters including min/max values.
  - name: min
    description: The minimum value to validate against the maximum value in the SmartScriptHolder.
  - name: max
    description: The maximum value to validate against the minimum value in the SmartScriptHolder.
  returns: Returns true if the min and max values are valid (i.e., min <= max), otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "SmartScriptHolder scriptEvent;\n// Assume scriptEvent has been populated\
      \ with valid data\nbool isValid = sSmartAIMgr->IsMinMaxValid(scriptEvent, 5,\
      \ 10);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with AI logic using these values\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking invalid min/max range
    code: "SmartScriptHolder scriptEvent;\n// Assume scriptEvent has been populated\
      \ with valid data\nbool isValid = sSmartAIMgr->IsMinMaxValid(scriptEvent, 10,\
      \ 5);\nif (!isValid)\n{\n    // Handle error case - invalid range\n    sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_AI_AND_SCRIPTS,\
      \ \"Invalid min/max values in SmartAI event\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during AI script loading and validation phases.
    It performs a simple comparison check without any external dependencies or complex
    logic. The method assumes that the SmartScriptHolder structure has already been
    initialized with valid data, and focuses solely on validating the relationship
    between min and max values.
  warnings: This method does not validate the actual contents of the SmartScriptHolder
    beyond the min/max relationship. It's important to ensure that other fields in
    the holder are also properly initialized before calling this method. Additionally,
    this check is only as reliable as the data passed into it, so invalid input could
    still lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly upstream.
