  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: InterruptMetrics InterruptCoordinatorFixed::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves interrupt-related performance metrics from the fixed interrupt
    coordinator.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a structured set of interrupt-related
    statistics and performance data collected by the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class.
    This includes information about interrupt occurrences, success rates, timing data,
    and other relevant metrics that help monitor and analyze the behavior of interrupt
    handling within the TrinityCore framework. The returned InterruptMetrics object
    encapsulates these values in a standardized format for further processing or reporting.
    This method is typically used for debugging, performance analysis, or monitoring
    of combat-related systems where interrupts play a significant role.
  parameters: []
  returns: An InterruptMetrics object containing detailed statistics about interrupt
    handling, including counts, timing data, and success/failure rates related to
    interrupt operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptMetrics metrics = interruptCoordinator.GetMetrics();

      std::cout << "Total interrupts: " << metrics.totalInterrupts << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Successful interrupts: " << metrics.successfulInterrupts << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not modify any internal
    state of the InterruptCoordinatorFixed instance. The returned InterruptMetrics
    object is a snapshot of current data at the time of the call, so subsequent calls
    may return different values if interrupt activity has occurred.
  warnings: The InterruptMetrics structure may contain uninitialized or default values
    if no interrupts have occurred since the coordinator was initialized. Always validate
    the returned data before using it in performance-critical code paths.
