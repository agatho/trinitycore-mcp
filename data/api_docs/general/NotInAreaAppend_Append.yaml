    const
documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    object for players not in a specific area.
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with data relevant to players who are not currently within a specified
    area. This functionality is typically used in World of Warcraft's channel system
    to manage which players receive certain channel notifications or updates based
    on their geographical location. The method modifies the provided packet object
    in-place, adding necessary fields such as player identifiers, channel information,
    and potentially location-based flags that determine visibility or accessibility
    of the channel. It is part of the internal infrastructure that supports area-based
    communication systems within TrinityCore's implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify object that
      will be populated with notification data for players outside the specified area.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Append method
    code: 'NotInAreaAppend notifier;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      notifier.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's channel management
    system to filter and broadcast messages only to players who are not within a certain
    area. The implementation may involve checking player positions against defined
    boundaries or zones, and could be part of larger systems such as instance-based
    channels or area-triggered notifications.
