documentation:
  brief: Sets the LFG ticket for the player
  description: The SetTicket method assigns a specific LFG (Looking for Group) ticket
    identifier to the player's data structure. This ticket is used internally by TrinityCore's
    LFG system to track and manage player group requests and matches. The method directly
    modifies the internal ticket state of the LfgPlayerData object, which is typically
    managed by the LFG subsystem. This operation is usually performed when a player
    submits a group request or receives a match notification.
  parameters:
  - name: ticket
    description: The LFG ticket identifier to assign to the player. This is typically
      a unique integer value generated by the LFG system that represents the player's
      current group request or match state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player's LFG Ticket
    code: 'LfgPlayerData playerData;

      int myTicket = 12345;

      playerData.SetTicket(myTicket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state and should only be called by
    the LFG subsystem or trusted components within the TrinityCore framework. The
    ticket value is typically managed automatically by the LFG manager.
