documentation:
  brief: Logs the current distribution of bot priorities for debugging and analysis
    purposes.
  description: The LogPriorityDistribution method outputs detailed information about
    how bot priorities are currently distributed within the system. This function
    is typically used for diagnostic purposes to understand which priority levels
    are most prevalent among active bots, aiding in performance tuning and behavior
    optimization. It does not modify any internal state but instead reads and logs
    the current priority assignments across all managed bots. The logging output includes
    statistical breakdowns of priority tiers and may be used in conjunction with other
    bot management tools to identify imbalances or anomalies in bot behavior distribution.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* priorityManager = BotPriorityManager::Instance();

      priorityManager->LogPriorityDistribution();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs logging operations which may impact performance if called
    excessively in high-frequency scenarios. It is recommended to use this function
    primarily during development or debugging sessions rather than in production environments
    where frequent logging could introduce overhead.
