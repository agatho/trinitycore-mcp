    encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles special positioning logic for group members during dungeon encounters
    based on encounter ID.
  description: The HandleSpecialPositioning method manages the strategic placement
    of players within a dungeon group during specific encounter events. This method
    is typically invoked when an encounter begins or transitions to a special phase
    that requires unique player positioning, such as avoiding certain areas, moving
    to designated locations, or preparing for mechanics that depend on player spacing
    or formation. It ensures that group members are correctly positioned according
    to the encounter's requirements and game rules. The method operates on a provided
    Group object and uses the encounterId to determine which specific positioning
    logic should be applied.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players that need special
      positioning during the dungeon encounter.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the current dungeon encounter, used to determine
      which special positioning rules apply.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Start
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::OnEncounterStart(uint32 encounterId)\n{\n    if\
      \ (Group* group = GetPlayer()->GetGroup())\n    {\n        dungeonBehavior.HandleSpecialPositioning(group,\
      \ encounterId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Custom Logic
    code: "void DungeonBehavior::HandleSpecialPositioning(Group* group, uint32 encounterId)\n\
      {\n    if (!group || !encounterId)\n        return;\n\n    // Example custom\
      \ positioning logic based on encounter ID\n    switch (encounterId)\n    {\n\
      \        case 1001: // Specific boss encounter\n            MoveGroupToSafeZone(group);\n\
      \            break;\n        case 1002: // Puzzle encounter\n            ArrangePlayersInFormation(group);\n\
      \            break;\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the dungeon encounter AI system and should be called
    during key moments in an encounter such as when it begins or transitions. It assumes
    that the Group object passed to it contains valid players and that the encounterId
    corresponds to a known encounter within the dungeon's context.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    incorrect encounterId values may result in unexpected positioning logic or no
    action being taken.
