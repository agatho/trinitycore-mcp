documentation:
  brief: Shuts down all registered managers in the registry
  description: The ShutdownAll method iterates through all registered managers within
    the ManagerRegistry and invokes their shutdown procedures. This method is typically
    called during server shutdown to ensure proper cleanup of resources managed by
    each individual manager. It guarantees that all managers are notified of the impending
    shutdown in a controlled manner, allowing them to perform necessary cleanup operations
    before the system terminates. The method does not return any value as it is designed
    to be a one-way operation for system termination.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: ManagerRegistry::instance()->ShutdownAll();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server shutdown or cleanup phases.
    Calling it during normal operation may result in undefined behavior as managers
    might be left in an inconsistent state.
