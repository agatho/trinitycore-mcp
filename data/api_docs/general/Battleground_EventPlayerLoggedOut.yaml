  class: Battleground
  method: EventPlayerLoggedOut
  signature: void Battleground::EventPlayerLoggedOut(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player logs out during a battleground.
  description: The EventPlayerLoggedOut method is invoked when a player disconnects
    or logs out while participating in a battleground. This method typically manages
    cleanup operations such as removing the player from the battleground's internal
    tracking systems, updating player states, and potentially triggering related events
    like adjusting the battleground's status if the player was the last one to leave.
    It ensures that the battleground remains in a consistent state even when players
    disconnect unexpectedly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who logged out.
      Must be a valid pointer to a player currently participating in the battleground.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground event handling
    code: "void MyBattleground::HandlePlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    EventPlayerLoggedOut(player);\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup logic can be added here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a player's session ends during a battleground. Developers should not call this
    method directly unless implementing custom battleground logic that requires explicit
    handling of player logout events.
  warnings: Do not assume that all players who log out will be removed from the battleground
    immediately; some cleanup may occur asynchronously. Also, ensure that any custom
    logic implemented in response to this event does not interfere with core battleground
    state management.
