  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: LoadActions
  signature: bool BotAIInitializer::LoadActions()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all available AI actions for bot behavior.
  description: The LoadActions method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all available AI actions that can be used by bots in the TrinityCore environment.
    This method typically reads action definitions from configuration files or internal
    databases, sets up action priorities, and prepares the action registry for use
    by bot AI systems. It ensures that bots have access to a complete set of behaviors
    they can execute during gameplay, including combat actions, movement patterns,
    and interaction routines. The method is usually called during bot initialization
    or when the AI system needs to refresh its available action set.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all actions were successfully loaded and initialized, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate configuration errors, missing
    action definitions, or internal initialization failures that prevent proper AI
    behavior setup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotAIInitializer initializer;\nbool success = initializer.LoadActions();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // AI actions are now loaded and ready for use\n    printf(\"\
      Bot AI actions loaded successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle loading failure\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to load bot AI actions\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during the initialization phase
    of a bot system. It may involve file I/O operations and database queries, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account in high-frequency scenarios. The method
    assumes that all necessary configuration files and data sources are accessible.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate action registrations or memory leaks. Ensure that the bot AI system
    is properly initialized before calling this method, as subsequent AI operations
    may depend on successful action loading.
