  class: KitingManager
  method: RequiresSprintForKiting
  signature: bool KitingManager::RequiresSprintForKiting()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player currently requires sprinting to maintain kiting
    speed.
  description: The RequiresSprintForKiting method evaluates the current state of the
    player's movement and combat situation to determine if sprinting is necessary
    for effective kiting. This method considers factors such as player speed, target
    distance, attack speed, and available stamina to decide whether the player should
    use sprint to maintain optimal kiting mechanics. The result is used by the kiting
    manager to control when sprint abilities should be automatically applied or recommended
    during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current kiting conditions require sprinting to maintain
    proper distance and speed; returns false otherwise. A return value of true indicates
    that the player's current movement state would benefit from sprint usage to sustain
    kiting effectiveness.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (kitingManager.RequiresSprintForKiting()) {\n    // Player should consider\
      \ using sprint for kiting\n    player->AddAura(SPELL_SPRINT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Kiting Logic
    code: "void PlayerKitingAI::Update()\n{\n    if (kitingManager.RequiresSprintForKiting()\
      \ && !player->HasAura(SPELL_SPRINT))\n    {\n        player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_SPRINT, true);\n    }\n    else if (!kitingManager.RequiresSprintForKiting()\
      \ && player->HasAura(SPELL_SPRINT))\n    {\n        player->RemoveAura(SPELL_SPRINT);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates and movement calculations.
    It's designed to work in conjunction with other kiting-related systems such as
    distance tracking, attack timing, and stamina management. The decision logic may
    vary based on player class, gear, and specific game mechanics.
  warnings: The method should not be used outside of combat or kiting scenarios as
    it may return incorrect results. Ensure proper initialization of the KitingManager
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
