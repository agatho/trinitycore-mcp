  class: Unit
  method: UpdateSplinePosition
  signature: void Unit::UpdateSplinePosition()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the unit's spline position to reflect its current movement state.
  description: The UpdateSplinePosition method is responsible for updating a Unit's
    internal spline position data, which represents the unit's current movement path
    in the game world. This method typically gets called during movement updates or
    when a unit's position needs to be synchronized with its spline path, particularly
    in cases involving dynamic movement such as flying or swimming. The method ensures
    that the unit's position reflects the correct spline coordinates and orientation,
    allowing for accurate movement tracking within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->UpdateSplinePosition();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally during movement updates and may
    be called automatically when a unit's position changes. It should not be manually
    called unless explicitly needed for special movement handling or debugging purposes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect movement tracking, especially
    in complex scenarios involving flying or swimming movement. Avoid calling this
    method outside of normal movement update cycles unless necessary.
