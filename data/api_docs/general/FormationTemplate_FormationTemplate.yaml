  signature: void FormationTemplate::FormationTemplate(FormationType t, const std::string
    & n, float spacing)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new formation template with specified type, name, and spacing
    parameters.
  description: The FormationTemplate constructor initializes a formation template
    object with the provided formation type, name, and spacing values. This method
    sets up the foundational data structure for managing creature formations within
    the TrinityCore framework. The formation type determines how creatures will position
    themselves relative to each other, while the name provides a unique identifier
    for the formation. The spacing parameter controls the distance between units in
    the formation. This constructor is typically used when defining custom formations
    for AI-controlled groups of creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: FormationType enum value specifying the type of formation to create.
      Valid values include various formation patterns like LINE, CIRCLE, SQUARE, etc.,
      which determine how creatures will position themselves relative to each other.
  - name: n
    description: String identifier for the formation template. This name is used to
      reference and retrieve specific formation configurations throughout the game
      system.
  - name: spacing
    description: Float value representing the spacing distance between creatures in
      the formation. This determines how far apart units will be positioned from each
      other within the formation pattern.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Line Formation Template
    code: 'FormationTemplate lineFormation(FORMATION_LINE, "MyLineFormation", 2.5f);

      // Creates a line formation with 2.5 unit spacing between creatures'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Circular Formation Template
    code: 'FormationTemplate circleFormation(FORMATION_CIRCLE, "MyCircleFormation",
      3.0f);

      // Creates a circular formation with 3.0 unit spacing between creatures'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during server initialization or when
    loading formation templates from database or configuration files. The FormationTemplate
    class is used primarily by the AI system to manage how groups of creatures move
    and position themselves in combat or patrol scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the formation type parameter corresponds to valid enum values
    defined in the FormationType enumeration. Invalid formation types may cause undefined
    behavior or runtime errors when the formation is subsequently used by AI systems.
