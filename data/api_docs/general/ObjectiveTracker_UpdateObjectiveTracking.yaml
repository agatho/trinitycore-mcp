  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: UpdateObjectiveTracking
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::UpdateObjectiveTracking(Player * bot, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the objective tracking state for a specified player character.
  description: The UpdateObjectiveTracking method is responsible for managing and
    updating the state of objectives that are being tracked by a player in the World
    of Warcraft game. This typically involves checking the progress of quests, achievements,
    or other in-game goals assigned to the player. The method takes a Player object
    and a time delta (diff) as parameters, which it uses to determine how much time
    has passed since the last update and whether any tracked objectives need to be
    refreshed or modified accordingly. It's an essential part of maintaining real-time
    objective status within the game client.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose objectives are being updated.
      This represents the specific character instance for which tracking information
      is managed.
  - name: diff
    description: An unsigned 32-bit integer representing the time elapsed (in milliseconds)
      since the last update cycle. Used to calculate timing-based changes in objective
      states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void UpdatePlayerObjectives(Player* player, uint32 deltaTime)\n{\n    ObjectiveTracker\
      \ tracker;\n    tracker.UpdateObjectiveTracking(player, deltaTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    static uint32 lastUpdate = 0;\n    uint32 currentTime\
      \ = getMSTime();\n    uint32 diff = currentTime - lastUpdate;\n    \n    for\
      \ (auto& player : sObjectAccessor->GetPlayers())\n    {\n        if (player)\n\
      \            objectiveTracker.UpdateObjectiveTracking(player, diff);\n    }\n\
      \    \n    lastUpdate = currentTime;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the game's main update loop to
    ensure real-time tracking of objectives. It may involve checking quest completion
    status, updating UI elements, and potentially triggering events or notifications
    when objectives are completed or modified.
