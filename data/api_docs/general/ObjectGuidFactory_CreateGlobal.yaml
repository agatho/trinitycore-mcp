    uint64 dbId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a global ObjectGuid with specified high GUID type and database identifiers
  description: The CreateGlobal method generates a unique ObjectGuid for game objects,
    players, or other entities within the TrinityCore framework. It combines a high
    GUID type identifier with two 64-bit database IDs to form a globally unique identifier
    that can be used throughout the game world. This method is typically used when
    initializing objects that need persistent identification across server sessions
    and database operations. The resulting ObjectGuid follows the standard TrinityCore
    GUID format where the high bits represent the object type and the lower bits contain
    the actual database identifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The HighGuid type enum value that specifies the category of object
      this GUID represents (e.g., HIGHGUID_PLAYER, HIGHGUID_UNIT, HIGHGUID_GAMEOBJECT).
      This determines how the GUID is interpreted by the game engine.
  - name: dbIdHigh
    description: The high 64-bit portion of the database identifier. Used for objects
      that require extended ID space beyond standard 32-bit identifiers, typically
      for large-scale world objects or entities with complex identification requirements.
  - name: dbId
    description: The low 64-bit portion of the database identifier. This represents
      the primary database row identifier for the object in question, used to retrieve
      specific object data from the database.
  returns: An ObjectGuid instance representing a globally unique identifier for the
    specified game object type with the provided database identifiers. The returned
    GUID can be used for object referencing, database operations, and network synchronization
    across the TrinityCore server.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Player GUID
    code: 'ObjectGuid playerGuid = guidFactory.CreateGlobal(HIGHGUID_PLAYER, 0, 12345);

      // Creates a player GUID with database ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Creature GUID
    code: 'ObjectGuid creatureGuid = guidFactory.CreateGlobal(HIGHGUID_UNIT, 0, 98765);

      // Creates a creature GUID with database ID 98765'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    ObjectGuid returned by this method is guaranteed to be globally unique within
    the server instance. The dbIdHigh parameter should typically be set to zero for
    most standard objects, unless specific extended ID requirements exist.
  warnings: Ensure that the HighGuid type parameter matches the actual object type
    being created, as incorrect types may cause lookup failures or unexpected behavior
    in the game world. Avoid using this method with invalid database IDs that do not
    correspond to existing records in the database.
