  method: AISpellInfoType
  signature: void AISpellInfoType::AISpellInfoType()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AISpellInfoType class with default values
    for AI spell configuration parameters.
  description: The AISpellInfoType constructor initializes all internal member variables
    to their default states, setting up the data structure used by the TrinityCore
    AI system to define spell behavior and conditions for NPC agents. This method
    is typically called when creating new AI spell entries or resetting existing ones
    to their baseline configuration. The initialization ensures that all spell-related
    parameters such as casting chances, cooldown periods, and target selection criteria
    are properly configured with sensible defaults before being customized for specific
    AI behaviors. This constructor plays a critical role in the AI system's ability
    to dynamically assign and execute spells based on combat conditions and NPC personality
    traits.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AI spell info instance
    code: 'AISpellInfoType spellInfo;

      // The spellInfo object is now initialized with default values

      // Ready to be configured for specific AI spell behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any dynamic memory allocation or external
    resource initialization. It simply sets member variables to their default states,
    making it safe to call multiple times on the same object instance. The class is
    designed to be used as a configuration container rather than an active AI component.
