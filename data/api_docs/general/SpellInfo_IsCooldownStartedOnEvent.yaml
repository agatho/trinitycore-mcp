documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell's cooldown has started on event.
  description: This method checks if a spell's cooldown period has begun, typically
    triggered by events such as casting or using the spell. It returns true when the
    cooldown is active and false when it's not, allowing developers to understand
    the current state of spell cooldowns within the game mechanics context. The method
    is commonly used in conjunction with other cooldown-related functions to manage
    spell usage and prevent abuse.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell's cooldown has started on event, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the spell is currently on cooldown and cannot be used again
    until the cooldown period expires.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Spell Cooldown Status
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsCooldownStartedOnEvent()) {\n    // Spell is on cooldown\n\
      \    // Do not allow player to use spell\n}\nelse {\n    // Spell is not on\
      \ cooldown\n    // Allow player to use spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other cooldown-related
    methods to determine the current state of a spell's cooldown. It may be called
    during spell casting or usage events to ensure proper cooldown management.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it directly affects game
    mechanics and player experience. Incorrect implementation can lead to overuse
    of spells or prevent legitimate use of spells.
