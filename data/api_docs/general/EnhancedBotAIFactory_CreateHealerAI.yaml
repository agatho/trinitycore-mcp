  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateHealerAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new healer AI instance for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreateHealerAI method is responsible for instantiating and configuring
    a healer AI behavior for a given bot player within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method likely assigns appropriate spell selections, targeting logic, and
    healing priority systems to ensure the bot can effectively perform healing duties
    in various game scenarios such as dungeons, raids, or PvP environments. The method
    may also handle initialization of healer-specific attributes like mana management,
    cooldown tracking, and target selection algorithms. It's designed to integrate
    seamlessly with the EnhancedBotAI system to provide specialized AI behavior for
    different class roles.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure status of the
    AI creation process. A positive value typically indicates successful creation,
    while a negative value may represent errors such as invalid player reference,
    insufficient resources, or failed initialization. The exact meaning of return
    codes should be verified against the implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healer AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid Player pointer\nint result\
      \ = factory->CreateHealerAI(bot);\nif (result >= 0) {\n    // AI successfully\
      \ created\n    printf(\"Healer AI created successfully with ID: %d\\n\", result);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to create healer AI, error\
      \ code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI system which extends TrinityCore's
    default bot functionality. The implementation likely involves setting up specific
    spell queues, target prioritization rules, and resource management strategies
    unique to healer classes. Developers should ensure that the Player object passed
    to this method is properly initialized and valid before calling to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid Player pointer may result in
    crashes or undefined behavior. The returned integer value must be checked for
    error conditions before assuming successful AI creation. This method may have
    performance implications if called frequently during bot initialization or when
    managing multiple bots simultaneously.
