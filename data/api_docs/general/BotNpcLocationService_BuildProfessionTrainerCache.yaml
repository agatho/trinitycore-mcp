documentation:
  brief: Populates the internal cache with profession trainer data from the game database.
  description: The BuildProfessionTrainerCache method initializes or updates an internal
    data structure that stores information about all profession trainers in the game
    world. This cache is used by the bot system to efficiently locate and interact
    with trainers for various professions without repeatedly querying the database.
    The method typically runs during server startup or when the trainer data is modified,
    ensuring that bot AI has access to up-to-date trainer locations and associated
    profession information. It processes NPC entries from the game database that are
    marked as profession trainers and caches their positions, associated skills, and
    other relevant metadata.

    initialized.
