  signature: bool VendorInteractionManager::IsEquipmentUpgrade(const ItemTemplate
    * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified item is an equipment upgrade eligible for
    vendor interaction.
  description: The IsEquipmentUpgrade method checks if a given item template represents
    an equipment upgrade that can be processed through vendor interactions. This typically
    includes items such as weapons, armor, or other gear that may have upgrade paths
    or enhancement capabilities within the game's economy system. The method evaluates
    various item properties and flags to determine compatibility with vendor upgrade
    mechanics. It is commonly used during vendor transaction processing to validate
    whether an item can be upgraded or enhanced through the vendor interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is classified as an equipment upgrade eligible
    for vendor interaction, false otherwise. This indicates that the item meets the
    criteria for being processed in vendor upgrade scenarios such as enchanting, reforging,
    or other enhancement operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "ItemTemplate const* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (vendorManager.IsEquipmentUpgrade(itemTemplate)) {\n    // Process upgrade\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"Item can be upgraded via vendor\\n\");\n} else {\n   \
      \ printf(\"Item cannot be upgraded via vendor\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal item flags and categories defined in
    the TrinityCore item system. It may perform checks against item class, subclass,
    and specific upgrade-related properties to determine eligibility. The implementation
    should be efficient as it might be called frequently during vendor transactions.
  warnings: Ensure that the ItemTemplate pointer passed is valid and not null before
    calling this method. Passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer could lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes in the game server.
