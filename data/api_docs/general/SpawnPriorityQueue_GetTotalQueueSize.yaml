  signature: size_t SpawnPriorityQueue::GetTotalQueueSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total number of elements currently queued in the
    SpawnPriorityQueue.
  description: The GetTotalQueueSize method provides a count of all items present
    in the SpawnPriorityQueue instance. This method is typically used to monitor queue
    length for performance tuning, debugging, or game logic decisions related to spawn
    management. It aggregates the sizes of all internal queues or containers that
    make up the priority queue structure. The returned value represents the cumulative
    number of queued elements across all priority levels and does not include any
    pending or deferred operations. This method is generally non-blocking and safe
    for concurrent access in multi-threaded environments, though specific thread safety
    guarantees may depend on the underlying implementation details of the SpawnPriorityQueue
    class.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the total number of elements currently stored
    in the SpawnPriorityQueue. Returns zero if the queue is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Queue Size
    code: "SpawnPriorityQueue spawnQueue;\n// ... populate the queue with spawn data\
      \ ...\nsize_t totalSize = spawnQueue.GetTotalQueueSize();\nif (totalSize > 1000)\
      \ {\n    // Log warning or take action for large queue\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Warning: Spawn queue size is %zu\", totalSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Queue Size in Spawn Management Logic
    code: "class SpawnManager {\npublic:\n    void ProcessSpawns() {\n        if (m_spawnQueue.GetTotalQueueSize()\
      \ > 0) {\n            // Process spawns only when queue has items\n        \
      \    while (!m_spawnQueue.Empty()) {\n                auto spawnData = m_spawnQueue.Pop();\n\
      \                // Handle individual spawn\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a constant-time operation to return the total queue
    size, making it efficient for regular monitoring. The implementation likely maintains
    an internal counter or iterates through priority levels to compute the sum of
    all elements. It's recommended to use this method sparingly in performance-critical
    sections due to potential synchronization overhead if the queue is accessed concurrently.
  warnings: The returned value may not reflect immediate changes if the queue is being
    modified by other threads simultaneously. In highly concurrent scenarios, the
    size might be inconsistent with actual processing state. Avoid relying on exact
    queue sizes for critical game logic decisions without considering race conditions.
