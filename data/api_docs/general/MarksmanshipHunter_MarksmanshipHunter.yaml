  class: MarksmanshipHunter
  method: MarksmanshipHunter
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunter::MarksmanshipHunter(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Marksmanship Hunter AI player with the specified bot player.
  description: The MarksmanshipHunter constructor initializes a specialized AI class
    for managing a hunter player character focused on marksmanship abilities. This
    method sets up the necessary internal state and configurations required for the
    AI to function properly within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor takes
    a Player pointer as input, which represents the actual bot character that will
    be controlled by this AI implementation. It performs initialization tasks such
    as setting up ability priorities, target selection logic, and combat behavior
    patterns specific to marksmanship hunters. This method is typically called during
    the creation or activation of an AI-controlled hunter character in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      MarksmanshipHunter hunterAI(bot);

      // The hunterAI is now initialized and ready to control the bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per AI instance. The Player pointer
    must not be null or already destroyed when this constructor is invoked. The AI
    system relies on proper initialization order, so this method should be called
    after the Player object has been fully constructed but before any AI behavior
    is activated.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same AI instance as
    it may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player pointer
    remains valid throughout the lifetime of the MarksmanshipHunter instance, as the
    AI will reference it during operation.
