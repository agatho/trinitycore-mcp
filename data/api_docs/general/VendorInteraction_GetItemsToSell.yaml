  class: VendorInteraction
  method: GetItemsToSell
  signature: int VendorInteraction::GetItemsToSell(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of items a bot can sell to a vendor.
  description: The GetItemsToSell method determines which items from a bot's inventory
    are eligible for sale back to a vendor. It evaluates each item in the bot's inventory
    based on criteria such as item quality, type, and whether the item is bound or
    tradeable. The method returns the count of items that meet these criteria, allowing
    the bot to efficiently identify what can be sold. This functionality is crucial
    for automated merchant interactions within TrinityCore-based bots.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of items in the bot's inventory
    that are eligible for sale to a vendor. A return value of zero indicates no sellable
    items were found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int itemCount = vendorInteraction.GetItemsToSell(bot);\nif (itemCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with selling items\n    // Implementation logic here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through the bot's inventory and applies vendor-specific
    rules to filter sellable items. Performance may be affected by large inventories,
    though typical bot inventories are usually small.
