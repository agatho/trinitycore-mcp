documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new bot session for the specified Battle.net account ID
  description: The BotSession constructor initializes a new bot session associated
    with a specific Battle.net account identifier. This method sets up the necessary
    internal state and data structures required for managing bot behavior within the
    TrinityCore framework. The initialization process typically involves establishing
    connections, loading configuration settings, and preparing the session context
    for subsequent bot operations. This constructor is part of the bot management
    system that allows administrators to create and control automated player characters
    (bots) within the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bnetAccountId
    description: The unique Battle.net account identifier that will own this bot session.
      This value must correspond to an existing Battle.net account in the database,
      otherwise the session initialization may fail or behave unexpectedly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Session Initialization
    code: 'BotSession* session = new BotSession(123456789);

      // Initializes a bot session for Battle.net account with ID 123456789'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Bot Sessions
    code: "std::vector<BotSession*> sessions;\nfor (uint32 accountId : {1001, 1002,\
      \ 1003}) {\n    sessions.push_back(new BotSession(accountId));\n}\n// Creates\
      \ three separate bot sessions for different Battle.net accounts"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during server startup or when a new
    bot needs to be registered. The session object should be properly managed and
    cleaned up to prevent memory leaks. Internal state initialization may involve
    database lookups and configuration loading which can impact performance if many
    sessions are created simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this constructor without a valid Battle.net account ID may result
    in undefined behavior or failed session initialization. Ensure that the provided
    account ID exists in the database before creating a BotSession instance. The constructor
    does not perform any validation of the account's permissions or bot eligibility.
