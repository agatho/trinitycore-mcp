documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the temporary summon is set to automatically resume after
    being dismissed.
  description: The IsAutoResummoned method checks if a TempSummon object is configured
    to automatically respawn or reappear after it has been dismissed or removed from
    the game world. This functionality is commonly used for summoned creatures that
    should return to their original location or state when certain conditions are
    met, such as when a player logs out and back in, or when a summon's duration expires
    but it is designed to reappear. The method returns true if auto-resumption is
    enabled for this summon, and false otherwise. This behavior is typically controlled
    by flags or settings set during the summon creation process.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the temporary summon will automatically
    resume after being dismissed. Returns true if auto-resumption is enabled; false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a summoned creature will auto-resume
    code: "if (TempSummon* summon = player->GetFirstSummon()) {\n    if (summon->IsAutoResummoned())\
      \ {\n        // The summon will automatically return when dismissed\n      \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Summon is set to auto-resume.\");\n    } else {\n     \
      \   // The summon will not reappear after dismissal\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Summon will not auto-resume.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with summon management systems
    to determine the behavior of summoned creatures. It's important to note that this
    setting may be overridden by other conditions such as player logout, zone changes,
    or specific spell effects.
