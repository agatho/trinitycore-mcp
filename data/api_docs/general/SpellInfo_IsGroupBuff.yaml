documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is a group buff
  description: This method checks if the spell is classified as a group buff, which
    means it provides benefits that affect multiple players within a group. The function
    returns true when the spell's properties indicate it should be applied to group
    members rather than individual targets. This is particularly relevant for spells
    that provide buffs such as increased health or mana, or other beneficial effects
    that are meant to enhance group performance. The method evaluates the spell's
    attributes and determines if it qualifies as a group buff based on its classification
    within the game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is a group buff, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the spell should be applied to group members rather than individual targets.
