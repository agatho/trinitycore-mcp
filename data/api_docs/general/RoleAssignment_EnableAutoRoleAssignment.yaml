  class: RoleAssignment
  method: EnableAutoRoleAssignment
  signature: void RoleAssignment::EnableAutoRoleAssignment(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic role assignment for players in the game.
  description: The EnableAutoRoleAssignment method controls whether players are automatically
    assigned roles within the game environment, such as tank, healer, or damage dealer.
    This functionality is typically used in group settings like dungeons, raids, or
    battlegrounds where role distribution affects gameplay mechanics and performance.
    When enabled, the system will automatically assign roles based on player class,
    specialization, and other relevant factors. When disabled, players must manually
    select their roles or rely on manual assignment by group leaders. The method does
    not validate input parameters beyond the boolean flag, so calling with an invalid
    value may result in undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean flag that determines whether automatic role assignment
      is enabled (true) or disabled (false). When true, the system will automatically
      assign roles to players; when false, manual assignment is required.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto Role Assignment
    code: 'RoleAssignment* roleAssign = new RoleAssignment();

      roleAssign->EnableAutoRoleAssignment(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto Role Assignment
    code: 'RoleAssignment* roleAssign = new RoleAssignment();

      roleAssign->EnableAutoRoleAssignment(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal game systems that manage player
    roles during group activities. It's important to call this method before initiating
    group content to ensure proper role distribution. The change takes effect immediately
    and affects all subsequent player entries into group scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the RoleAssignment
    object may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the object is properly
    constructed before invoking this method.
