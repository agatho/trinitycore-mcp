    * reverseMap, const std::string & table)
documentation:
  brief: Loads quest relations from a specified database table into memory maps for
    fast lookup.
  description: 'The LoadQuestRelationsHelper method is responsible for loading quest-related
    data from a specified database table into internal memory structures. It populates
    two data structures: a forward map (QuestRelations) that maps quest IDs to related
    entries, and an optional reverse map (QuestRelationsReverse) that allows looking
    up quests by the related entry. This method is typically called during server
    startup or database reload operations to ensure all quest relationships are properly
    indexed in memory for efficient runtime access. The method does not validate data
    integrity beyond basic loading; it assumes the database table structure matches
    expected formats.'
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Reference to a QuestRelations map that will be populated with quest
      ID to related entry mappings. This is used for fast lookup of entries associated
      with a specific quest.
  - name: reverseMap
    description: Pointer to an optional QuestRelationsReverse map that will be populated
      with reverse lookups from related entries back to quests. Can be null if reverse
      mapping is not required.
  - name: table
    description: String identifier for the database table containing quest relation
      data. This determines which SQL table is queried for loading relations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: 'QuestRelations questAreaMap;

      QuestRelationsReverse questAreaReverseMap;

      ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadQuestRelationsHelper(questAreaMap, &questAreaReverseMap,
      "quest_area_trigger");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading multiple relation types with separate maps
    code: 'QuestRelations questItemMap;

      QuestRelationsReverse questItemReverseMap;

      QuestRelations questNpcMap;

      QuestRelationsReverse questNpcReverseMap;


      ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadQuestRelationsHelper(questItemMap, &questItemReverseMap,
      "quest_item");

      ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadQuestRelationsHelper(questNpcMap, &questNpcReverseMap,
      "quest_npc");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reloads.
    It performs a single database query per call to fetch all entries from the specified
    table. The method assumes that the database schema matches expected column structures
    (typically quest_id and entry columns). Performance can be impacted by large datasets
    in the source tables, especially if reverse maps are enabled.
  warnings: This method should only be called during initialization or reload phases
    when no concurrent access to quest data is occurring. Modifying the underlying
    database while this method is running may lead to inconsistent state. Ensure that
    the table name passed matches an existing database table with correct column structure.
