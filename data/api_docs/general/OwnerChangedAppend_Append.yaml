documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to the provided WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    structure.
  description: The OwnerChangedAppend::Append method is responsible for populating
    a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet with relevant data when a channel
    owner has changed. This method is typically invoked during channel management
    operations, such as when a player is promoted or demoted to channel owner status.
    The method modifies the input packet structure in-place by adding appropriate
    notification fields that indicate the change in ownership. It does not return
    any value but directly alters the state of the provided data object. This functionality
    is integral to maintaining real-time communication state updates within the TrinityCore
    framework's channel system.

    code: 'WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      OwnerChangedAppend append;

      append.Append(notifyPacket);

      // notifyPacket now contains the updated channel owner notification data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a pre-existing WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    object and modifies it in-place. It assumes that the packet structure has been
    properly initialized before calling. The implementation likely involves setting
    specific flags or fields within the packet to indicate an owner change event.
