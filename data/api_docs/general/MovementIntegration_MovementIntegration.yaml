  class: MovementIntegration
  method: MovementIntegration
  signature: void MovementIntegration::MovementIntegration(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes movement integration for a player bot, setting up necessary movement
    behaviors and states.
  description: The MovementIntegration constructor initializes the movement behavior
    for a player bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up internal
    state management for the bot's movement system, including pathfinding configurations,
    movement speed adjustments, and integration with the core AI subsystem. It ensures
    that the bot can properly navigate the game world according to its assigned role
    or task. The initialization process typically occurs during bot creation or when
    transitioning a player character into bot mode. This method does not perform any
    direct movement actions but prepares the underlying infrastructure required for
    movement operations.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will have
      movement integration initialized. Must be a valid player instance, typically
      created through the bot management system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Integration Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = new Player();

      // ... bot initialization code ...

      MovementIntegration movementInt(myBot);

      // Movement integration is now active for the bot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Manager System
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void CreateAndInitializeBot(Player* player)\
      \ {\n        // Set up bot properties\n        MovementIntegration movementInt(player);\n\
      \        // Additional bot setup\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may cause undefined behavior or memory leaks. The method assumes
    that the Player object passed in is properly allocated and initialized with valid
    player data. Movement integration relies on the underlying AI system, so proper
    AI setup must occur before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will likely result in a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object is fully constructed and
    valid before passing it to this constructor. This method does not validate the
    player's state or role - it simply initializes movement integration without checking
    if the player is actually intended to be a bot.
