  signature: GroupCategory Group::GetGroupCategory() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the category type of the group.
  description: The GetGroupCategory method returns the GroupCategory enumeration value
    that represents the type of group this object represents. This is used internally
    by TrinityCore to distinguish between different types of groups such as raid groups,
    party groups, or battleground groups. The returned value helps determine how the
    group should be handled in various game systems and UI elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupCategory enumeration value indicating the type of group. Possible
    values include GROUP_CATEGORY_NONE, GROUP_CATEGORY_RAID, GROUP_CATEGORY_PARTY,
    and GROUP_CATEGORY_BATTLEGROUND.
  examples:
  - title: Check if group is a raid
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->GetGroupCategory()\
      \ == GROUP_CATEGORY_RAID)\n{\n    // Handle raid-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not modify the group state. It's
    commonly used in game logic to route group operations based on their category
    type.
