  class: Corpse
  method: ReplaceAllFlags
  signature: void Corpse::ReplaceAllFlags(int flags)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all flags on the corpse with the specified flag value.
  description: The ReplaceAllFlags method updates all flag fields associated with
    a Corpse object to the provided integer value. This method is typically used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to manage the state and
    behavior of player corpses, such as setting their visibility, loot eligibility,
    or respawn status. The operation directly modifies internal flag bits within the
    corpse data structure without requiring additional database updates or network
    packets. This method should be called carefully as it can affect how the corpse
    is handled by the game engine, including its removal from the world, loot availability,
    and player resurrection mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: An integer value representing the new flag state to apply to all
      corpse flags. This value typically represents a bitmask where individual bits
      control different aspects of corpse behavior such as visibility, loot status,
      or respawn settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Corpse Flags to Full Visibility and Lootable
    code: "Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n{\n    corpse->ReplaceAllFlags(CORPSE_FLAG_FULL_LOOT\
      \ | CORPSE_FLAG_VISIBLE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear All Corpse Flags to Default State
    code: "Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n{\n    corpse->ReplaceAllFlags(0);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal flags and bypasses normal game state
    transitions. It should not be used in conjunction with other flag manipulation
    methods unless carefully coordinated to avoid conflicts. The method does not trigger
    any automatic updates to the database or world state; changes are only reflected
    in memory until explicitly saved.
  warnings: Using this method incorrectly can result in unexpected behavior such as
    corpses that do not despawn properly, players unable to resurrect, or loot not
    being available. Always ensure that the flag values passed are valid and appropriate
    for the intended corpse state. Avoid calling this method during active gameplay
    loops without proper synchronization.
