  signature: const int & UpdateData::GetOutOfRangeGUIDs() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the internal collection of GUIDs that are out of range
    for updates.
  description: The GetOutOfRangeGUIDs method retrieves a constant reference to an
    internal data structure containing the list of GameObject and Item GUIDs that
    are currently out of range for player update packets. This is used in the TrinityCore's
    update system to manage which objects should be removed from a player's client
    view when they move beyond the visibility distance. The returned reference provides
    direct access to the underlying container, allowing efficient iteration or manipulation
    without copying data. This method is typically called during the update process
    to determine which objects need to be marked for removal from a player's visible
    set.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an internal collection (likely std::set or similar)
    of GUIDs that are out of range and should be removed from the player's update
    list. The actual type is not specified in the signature but is expected to be
    a container holding GameObject and Item GUIDs.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating through out-of-range GUIDs
    code: "UpdateData updateData;\n// ... populate updateData with data ...\nconst\
      \ auto& outOfRangeGUIDs = updateData.GetOutOfRangeGUIDs();\nfor (const auto&\
      \ guid : outOfRangeGUIDs) {\n    // Process each GUID that is out of range\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Out of range GUID: \" << guid << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, meaning the caller should not modify
    the returned collection directly. The internal data structure is managed by the
    UpdateData class and may be modified by other methods during the update cycle.
    It's important to use this method only when the data is guaranteed to be valid
    and consistent for the duration of the operation.
  warnings: Since this returns a reference to an internal member, modifying the returned
    collection directly will corrupt the internal state of UpdateData. Also, the contents
    of the returned container may change between calls if other methods modify the
    update data, so it should not be cached or stored for later use without revalidation.
