  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateClient
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateClient(HighGuid type, uint32 realmId,
    uint32 arg1, uint64 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new client-side ObjectGuid with specified high GUID type, realm
    ID, argument, and counter values.
  description: The CreateClient method generates a unique ObjectGuid suitable for
    use in client-side game objects. It constructs the GUID using a combination of
    the provided high GUID type, realm identifier, an additional argument (which may
    represent entity type or sub-type), and a counter value to ensure uniqueness.
    This method is typically used when creating new entities such as players, creatures,
    game objects, or items that need to be uniquely identified within the World of
    Warcraft client environment. The resulting ObjectGuid follows TrinityCore's internal
    GUID structure where the high bits encode the type information, the realm ID identifies
    the specific server realm, and the counter ensures uniqueness among entities of
    the same type within that realm.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The HighGuid enumeration value specifying the type of object this
      GUID represents (e.g., HIGHGUID_PLAYER, HIGHGUID_UNIT, HIGHGUID_GAMEOBJECT).
      This determines how the GUID is interpreted by the client and server.
  - name: realmId
    description: The unique identifier for the realm or world where this object exists.
      Used to distinguish objects across different server instances in a multi-realm
      environment.
  - name: arg1
    description: Additional argument value that may represent sub-type information,
      entity class, or other domain-specific data depending on the HighGuid type.
      For example, it might indicate creature entry ID for units or item template
      ID for items.
  - name: counter
    description: A monotonically increasing counter value used to ensure that GUIDs
      generated for objects of the same type and realm remain unique. This is typically
      managed by a global or realm-specific counter.
  returns: An ObjectGuid instance representing the newly created unique identifier
    for a client-side game object, properly formatted according to TrinityCore's GUID
    structure with all components correctly encoded.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Player GUID
    code: ObjectGuid playerGuid = guidFactory.CreateClient(HighGuid::HIGHGUID_PLAYER,
      1, 0, 12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Creature GUID
    code: ObjectGuid creatureGuid = guidFactory.CreateClient(HighGuid::HIGHGUID_UNIT,
      1, 12345, 67890);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the counter parameter is properly managed to avoid
    collisions. The realmId should match the current server's realm identifier. The
    arg1 parameter's meaning varies based on the HighGuid type, so developers must
    ensure correct usage per object type.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the HighGuid type can lead to misinterpretation of
    the GUID by client or server components. Using a non-unique counter value will
    result in duplicate GUIDs which may cause gameplay issues or crashes.
