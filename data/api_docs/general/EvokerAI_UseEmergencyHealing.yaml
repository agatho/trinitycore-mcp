  class: EvokerAI
  method: UseEmergencyHealing
  signature: void EvokerAI::UseEmergencyHealing()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates emergency healing behavior for the evoker AI unit.
  description: The UseEmergencyHealing method is responsible for triggering the evoker
    AI's emergency healing response. This function is typically invoked when the evoker
    is under threat or when its health drops below a certain threshold, prompting
    it to use emergency healing abilities such as 'Emerald Blossom' or other defensive
    spells. The method evaluates the current state of the evoker and its target, then
    selects an appropriate healing spell based on the game's internal logic and the
    evoker's current resource availability. It ensures that healing is prioritized
    in critical situations to maintain survivability during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30.0f)\n    {\n        UseEmergencyHealing();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the evoker's AI behavior system and should only be
    called when the evoker is in a combat state or under immediate threat. The method
    does not directly cast spells but rather initiates the healing process within
    the AI framework.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called excessively during combat as it
    may lead to resource depletion or spell cooldown issues. It should only be invoked
    when the evoker's health is critically low and emergency healing is warranted.
