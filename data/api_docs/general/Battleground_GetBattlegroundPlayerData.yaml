  class: Battleground
  method: GetBattlegroundPlayerData
  signature: const BattlegroundPlayer * Battleground::GetBattlegroundPlayerData(const
    int & playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves battleground player data for a specified player GUID.
  description: The GetBattlegroundPlayerData method retrieves a const pointer to the
    BattlegroundPlayer structure associated with a given player's GUID. This structure
    contains player-specific information relevant to the battleground, such as team,
    score, and other match-related statistics. The method is typically used during
    battleground operations to access or modify player state without direct access
    to the underlying player object. It assumes that the player is currently participating
    in the battleground and that the GUID corresponds to an active participant.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose battleground data
      is being retrieved. This value must correspond to a valid player who is currently
      participating in the battleground.
  returns: A const pointer to the BattlegroundPlayer structure for the specified player
    GUID, or nullptr if no such player exists in the battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Player Data
    code: "const BattlegroundPlayer* bgPlayer = bg->GetBattlegroundPlayerData(playerGuid);\n\
      if (bgPlayer)\n{\n    // Access player data\n    uint32 team = bgPlayer->Team;\n\
      \    uint32 score = bgPlayer->Score;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Player Participation
    code: "const BattlegroundPlayer* bgPlayer = bg->GetBattlegroundPlayerData(playerGuid);\n\
      if (bgPlayer == nullptr)\n{\n    // Player is not in the battleground\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Player %u is not in the battleground.\", playerGuid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player\
      \ is in the battleground, proceed with operations\n    sLog->outInfo(\"Player\
      \ %u found in battleground.\", playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup based on the player GUID and may involve iterating
    through internal battleground data structures. It is recommended to cache results
    when frequently accessing player data to avoid repeated lookups. The returned
    pointer is valid only as long as the player remains in the battleground.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned BattlegroundPlayer structure directly unless
    you are certain of the implications; modifications may affect gameplay balance
    or cause unexpected behavior. Always check for null return values before using
    the result to prevent segmentation faults.
