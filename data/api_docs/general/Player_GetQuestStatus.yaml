  brief: Returns the quest status for a specified quest ID
  description: The GetQuestStatus method retrieves the current status of a specific
    quest for the player. This method is commonly used in quest-related scripts and
    game mechanics to determine whether a player has completed, failed, or is still
    active on a particular quest. The returned value represents the quest's progress
    state, which can be used to trigger quest-related events or actions within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the quest status. Possible values include
    0 (not active), 1 (active), 2 (completed), and 3 (failed). The exact meaning depends
    on the quest's state in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int status = player->GetQuestStatus(quest_id);\nif (status == 2)\n{\n \
      \   // Quest completed\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    like GetQuestReward and GetQuestObjective. Performance considerations include
    avoiding repeated calls for the same quest ID within a short time frame.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in loops or repeatedly, as it may cause
    performance issues if not properly optimized. Also note that the return value
    might vary depending on the quest's state in the game world.
