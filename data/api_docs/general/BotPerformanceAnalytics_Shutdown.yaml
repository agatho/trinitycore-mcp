  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot performance analytics system, cleaning up resources and
    stopping data collection.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the bot performance analytics subsystem
    within TrinityCore. This function is responsible for safely disposing of allocated
    resources, stopping any ongoing data collection processes, and ensuring that all
    pending analytics data is properly flushed or discarded. It should be called during
    server shutdown or when the analytics system needs to be temporarily disabled.
    The method performs no operations if the analytics system was not initialized,
    making it safe to call multiple times. This function typically ensures thread
    safety by synchronizing access to shared resources before proceeding with cleanup.

    code: BotPerformanceAnalytics::Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be safely called
    multiple times without causing errors. It may block briefly during cleanup operations
    depending on the amount of pending data. The shutdown process ensures that no
    memory leaks occur and that all internal buffers are properly released.
