documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum skill value allowed by server configuration.
  description: Retrieves the configured maximum value for player skills in the World
    of Warcraft server. This value determines the upper limit that can be reached
    for any skill, including combat abilities, professions, and secondary skills.
    The returned value is typically defined in the server's configuration files or
    database settings and affects gameplay mechanics such as skill progression and
    ability scaling. This method provides a consistent way to access this global configuration
    setting across the TrinityCore codebase.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value representing the maximum allowed skill level. This value
    typically ranges from 1 to 3000+ depending on server configuration, with common
    default values being 300 or 450 for standard retail-like configurations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Maximum Skill Value
    code: "uint16 maxSkill = sWorld->GetConfigMaxSkillValue();\nif (maxSkill > 0)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"Maximum skill value is: \" << maxSkill << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Maximum Skill Value for Skill Validation
    code: "void ValidatePlayerSkill(uint16 skillValue)\n{\n    uint16 maxSkill = sWorld->GetConfigMaxSkillValue();\n\
      \    if (skillValue > maxSkill)\n    {\n        // Handle invalid skill value\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Invalid skill value: %u exceeds maximum allowed: %u\"\
      , skillValue, maxSkill);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a server-wide configuration value that is typically
    loaded during server startup. The value may be overridden by different server
    configurations or patches. This method is thread-safe as it only reads a cached
    configuration value.
  warnings: Ensure that any code using this value properly validates skill values
    against the returned maximum to prevent out-of-bounds errors. Some server configurations
    may have very high maximum skill values (e.g., 6000+) which could affect performance
    if not handled properly in calculations.
