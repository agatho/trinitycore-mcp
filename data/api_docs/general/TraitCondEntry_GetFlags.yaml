  method: GetFlags
  signature: int TraitCondEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with a trait condition entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitwise
    flags that define the conditions and behaviors for a specific trait in the World
    of Warcraft game system. These flags are used internally by TrinityCore to determine
    how trait conditions should be evaluated and applied during gameplay. The returned
    value typically combines multiple flag bits that indicate various properties such
    as whether the condition is required, if it's a passive trait, or other behavioral
    modifiers. This method provides read-only access to the internal flag state of
    the trait condition entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value containing the bitwise flags that define the behavior
    and conditions of this trait entry. Each bit in the returned integer represents
    a specific flag with predefined meanings within the TrinityCore trait system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Trait Flags
    code: "TraitCondEntry* traitCond = sTraitCondStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif (traitCond)\n\
      {\n    int flags = traitCond->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & TRAIT_COND_FLAG_REQUIRED)\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle required trait condition\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a simple getter operation and does not modify any internal
    state. The flag values are defined by the game's trait system and should be referenced
    against the official TrinityCore trait flag definitions. This method is commonly
    used in trait evaluation logic during character progression and specialization
    handling.
