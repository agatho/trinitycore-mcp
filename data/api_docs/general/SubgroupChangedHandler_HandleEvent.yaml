  signature: bool SubgroupChangedHandler::HandleEvent(const GroupEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles group subgroup changes in the game world
  description: The HandleEvent method is responsible for processing group-related
    events that occur when a player's subgroup membership changes within a group.
    This handler manages the logic for updating player positions, synchronizing group
    data, and ensuring proper communication between group members. The method typically
    receives a GroupEvent object containing information about the change, such as
    player joining or leaving a subgroup, and performs necessary updates to maintain
    group integrity. It is part of the TrinityCore's event handling system for managing
    dynamic group compositions during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A constant reference to a GroupEvent object containing details about
      the subgroup change event including player information, old subgroup ID, new
      subgroup ID, and event type
  returns: Returns true if the event was successfully processed and handled, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the event could not be properly
    processed or that an error occurred during handling.
  examples:
  - title: Basic subgroup change handling
    code: "bool result = subgroupHandler.HandleEvent(groupEvent);\nif (result) {\n\
      \    // Event was successfully processed\n    sLog->outString(\"Subgroup change\
      \ handled successfully\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to process the event\n \
      \   sLog->outError(\"Failed to handle subgroup change event\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event handling with error checking
    code: "const GroupEvent& event = GetGroupChangeEvent();\nbool success = subgroupHandler.HandleEvent(event);\n\
      if (!success) {\n    // Log the failure and potentially notify the player\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Subgroup change handler failed for player %u\", event.GetPlayerGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    // Additional error recovery logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the TrinityCore's main game loop
    or event processing system. The handler may perform synchronization operations
    with other players in the group, update internal data structures, and potentially
    send network packets to inform other players of the subgroup change. It's important
    that this method be thread-safe as it may be invoked from different threads during
    concurrent gameplay operations.
  warnings: The method assumes that the GroupEvent object passed contains valid data.
    If an invalid or malformed event is provided, the behavior may be undefined. Developers
    should ensure proper validation of event parameters before calling this method.
    Additionally, improper handling of subgroup changes can lead to desynchronization
    between players and incorrect group positioning.
