  brief: Checks if the Chi system is available for use by a player.
  description: The ChiSystem::available() method determines whether the Chi system
    is currently enabled and accessible for a player character. This system is typically
    associated with certain classes or abilities in World of Warcraft, particularly
    those related to energy management or special mechanics. The method returns true
    if the system is active and usable, and false if it's disabled or not applicable
    to the current game state or character configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the Chi system is available.
    True indicates the system can be used; false indicates it is currently unavailable
    or disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Availability Check
    code: "if (player->GetChiSystem()->available()) {\n    // Proceed with Chi-based\
      \ actions\n    player->UseChiAbility();\n} else {\n    // Handle unavailable\
      \ system case\n    player->SendNotification(\"Chi system not available.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal flags or state conditions that determine
    if the Chi system should be active. It may be called frequently during gameplay
    to ensure proper system state management.
