documentation:
  brief: Records a failed bot spawn event in the performance monitoring system.
  description: The RecordFailedSpawn method logs an unsuccessful attempt to spawn
    a bot within the TrinityCore server environment. This function is typically invoked
    when a bot fails to initialize or appear in the world due to various reasons such
    as resource constraints, invalid configuration, or server-side limitations. The
    method contributes to performance monitoring and debugging by tracking spawn failures,
    which can help identify issues with bot deployment, memory allocation, or system
    load. It does not return any value and is intended for internal use within the
    bot management subsystem.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Manager
    code: "void BotManager::HandleSpawnFailure()\n{\n    m_performanceMonitor->RecordFailedSpawn();\n\
      \    // Additional error handling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe as it's part of a performance monitoring
    interface, but callers should verify the implementation details. The recorded
    data may be used for statistical analysis or alerting systems to monitor bot spawn
    reliability.
