  class: Trigger
  method: GetType
  signature: TriggerType Trigger::GetType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the type identifier of the trigger object.
  description: The GetType method returns the TriggerType enumeration value that identifies
    the specific category or class of the trigger. This allows developers to determine
    how the trigger should behave or what actions it is intended to perform within
    the game world. The returned value can be used to conditionally execute logic
    based on the trigger's type, enabling flexible and dynamic trigger handling in
    World of Warcraft's scripting and AI systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A TriggerType enumeration value indicating the specific type of this trigger.
    Possible values include but are not limited to TRIGGER_TYPE_EVENT, TRIGGER_TYPE_SPELL,
    TRIGGER_TYPE_ITEM, or TRIGGER_TYPE_CREATURE, depending on how the trigger was
    defined in the game database or script.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Type Checking
    code: "Trigger* trigger = ...;\nTriggerType type = trigger->GetType();\nif (type\
      \ == TRIGGER_TYPE_SPELL)\n{\n    // Handle spell-based trigger logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Type in Conditional Logic
    code: "void HandleTrigger(Trigger* trigger)\n{\n    switch (trigger->GetType())\n\
      \    {\n        case TRIGGER_TYPE_EVENT:\n            // Process event trigger\n\
      \            break;\n        case TRIGGER_TYPE_ITEM:\n            // Process\
      \ item trigger\n            break;\n        default:\n            // Default\
      \ handling\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not modify the trigger object.
    It's typically used in conjunction with other trigger methods to determine behavior
    at runtime. The TriggerType enumeration values are defined in the TrinityCore
    source code and correspond to specific trigger definitions in the game database.
  warnings: Ensure that the trigger pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    accessing a null trigger could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    different trigger types may require different handling logic, so proper type checking
    is essential for safe operation.
