  method: GetSpellId
  signature: uint32 GameObject::GetSpellId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell ID associated with the GameObject.
  description: The GetSpellId method retrieves the unique spell identifier that is
    linked to a specific GameObject instance. This spell ID typically corresponds
    to the spell that was used to create or activate the GameObject, and it plays
    a crucial role in determining the game mechanics and behavior of the object. The
    method is commonly used during gameplay events such as quest completion, spell
    casting, or when the GameObject is interacted with by players. It returns a uint32
    value representing the spell ID, which may be zero if no spell is associated with
    the GameObject.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the spell ID associated with the GameObject,
    typically used for determining the effects of spells or interactions during gameplay
    events. A value of zero indicates that no spell is linked to the object, which
    can occur when the GameObject is not activated by a spell or when it's a static
    object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 spellId = gameobject->GetSpellId();\nif (spellId != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Process the spell ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It's important
    to note that the returned spell ID may vary depending on how the GameObject was
    created or activated, and it should be used in conjunction with other methods
    like GetGOData() or GetSpellInfo() for full context.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return zero if the GameObject
    is not associated with a spell. Also, ensure that the GameObject instance is valid
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
