  signature: bool GatheringManager::IsInGatheringRange(const GatheringNode & node)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is within the valid gathering range of a specified gathering
    node.
  description: The IsInGatheringRange method determines whether the player associated
    with the GatheringManager instance is currently within the acceptable distance
    to interact with a given gathering node. This method evaluates the spatial relationship
    between the player's position and the node's location, ensuring that the player
    is close enough to perform gathering actions such as mining, herbalism, or skinning.
    The check typically accounts for game-specific mechanics like minimum interaction
    distances and any environmental restrictions that may prevent gathering at certain
    locations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is within the valid gathering range of the node;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (gatheringManager.IsInGatheringRange(node)) {\n    // Player can gather\
      \ from this node\n    player->Gather(node);\n} else {\n    // Move closer to\
      \ the node\n    player->MoveTo(node.GetPosition());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the player's current position and the node's coordinates
    to calculate distance, possibly incorporating a tolerance margin or minimum distance
    threshold. It may also consider the player's state (e.g., if they are mounted
    or in combat) that could affect gathering eligibility.
