documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of another BotSessionFactory object to this instance.
  description: The assignment operator for the BotSessionFactory class copies all
    member data from the provided BotSessionFactory object to the current instance.
    This operation ensures that both objects become equivalent in state, with the
    current object taking on the values of the source object. The method follows standard
    C++ copy semantics and returns a reference to the current object to allow for
    chaining operations. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this operator
    is used to duplicate or transfer the configuration and state of one bot session
    factory to another, which may be necessary when reconfiguring or cloning bot behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotSessionFactory object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance.
  returns: A reference to the current BotSessionFactory object, enabling operator
    chaining such as 'a = b = c'.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'BotSessionFactory factory1;

      BotSessionFactory factory2;

      // Configure factory1...

      factory2 = factory1; // Copies contents of factory1 to factory2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'BotSessionFactory a, b, c;

      // Configure objects...

      a = b = c; // Assigns c''s contents to b, then b''s contents to a'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely performs deep copying of internal data structures. It
    is important to ensure that any dynamically allocated memory within BotSessionFactory
    is properly managed during assignment to avoid memory leaks or dangling pointers.
