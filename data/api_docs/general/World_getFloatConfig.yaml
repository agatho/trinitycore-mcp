documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a floating-point configuration value from the world configuration
    based on the provided index.
  description: The getFloatConfig method is used to retrieve specific floating-point
    configuration values defined in the WorldFloatConfigs enumeration. This method
    allows access to various game settings and parameters that control gameplay behavior,
    such as rate multipliers, time factors, or other numeric configuration options.
    The method takes a single parameter representing the index of the desired configuration
    value and returns the corresponding float value. It is typically used during runtime
    to dynamically adjust or query game settings without requiring server restarts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a floating-point value corresponding to the requested configuration
    index. The actual value depends on the specific WorldFloatConfigs enum value provided
    as input. Common return values might include rate multipliers (e.g., 1.0f for
    normal rates, 2.0f for double rates) or time-related factors.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve the PvP kill reward rate
    code: 'float killRate = World::instance()->getFloatConfig(WORLD_FLOAT_PVP_KILL_REWARD_RATE);

      // Returns the configured rate multiplier for PvP kill rewards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Get the experience gain rate for players
    code: "float expRate = World::instance()->getFloatConfig(WORLD_FLOAT_EXP_RATE);\n\
      if (expRate > 1.0f)\n{\n    // Server is running with increased experience rates\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Server running with %.2fx experience rate\", expRate);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a global configuration cache and should be used efficiently.
    The WorldFloatConfigs enumeration contains predefined constants for different
    game settings, and each constant maps to a specific floating-point value stored
    in the world configuration system. The method is thread-safe as it only reads
    from a cached configuration structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided index parameter corresponds to a valid WorldFloatConfigs
    enum value; invalid indices may result in undefined behavior or incorrect values.
    This method should not be used for setting values, only for reading current configuration
    settings.
