documentation:
  brief: Removes expired quest validation cache entries from memory.
  description: The CleanupExpiredCache method is responsible for removing outdated
    quest validation data from the internal cache structure. This method ensures that
    stale or expired quest validation entries do not consume unnecessary memory resources.
    It typically runs periodically as part of the server's maintenance routines to
    keep the quest validation system efficient and up-to-date. The cleanup process
    evaluates each cached entry against current time thresholds to determine expiration
    status.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: QuestValidation::CleanupExpiredCache();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the server's background maintenance
    tasks. Developers should not typically call this method directly unless implementing
    custom cache management logic. The cleanup operation is thread-safe and does not
    block other operations.
