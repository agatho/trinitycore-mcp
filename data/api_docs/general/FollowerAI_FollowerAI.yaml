api:
  class: FollowerAI
  method: FollowerAI
  signature: void FollowerAI::FollowerAI(int * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a FollowerAI instance with the provided creature pointer.
  description: The FollowerAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a creature
    that follows a player or another entity. This method sets up internal state variables
    and prepares the AI to handle follower-specific logic such as movement, combat,
    and interaction with the player. The constructor typically expects a valid creature
    pointer which represents the NPC instance that will be controlled by this AI type.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that this FollowerAI will control.
      Must be a valid pointer to an existing creature instance, otherwise behavior
      is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic FollowerAI Initialization
    code: "class MyFollower : public FollowerAI {\npublic:\n    MyFollower(Creature*\
      \ creature) : FollowerAI(creature) {}\n};\n\n// Usage in creature AI creation\n\
      void AddSC_my_follower() {\n    RegisterCreatureAI(MyFollower);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a creature with FollowerAI is spawned. Developers should not manually instantiate
    FollowerAI objects directly unless implementing custom AI logic that inherits
    from it.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid creature pointer to this constructor will result
    in undefined behavior and likely crash the server. Always ensure the creature
    parameter is valid before calling this constructor.
