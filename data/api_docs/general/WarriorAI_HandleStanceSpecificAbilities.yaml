  signature: void WarriorAI::HandleStanceSpecificAbilities(WarriorStance stance, ::Unit
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles stance-specific ability execution for warrior AI based on current
    combat stance and target.
  description: The HandleStanceSpecificAbilities method manages the execution of abilities
    that are unique to specific warrior stances, such as Battle Stance, Defensive
    Stance, or Berserker Stance. This method evaluates the current stance of the warrior
    AI and determines which abilities should be applied or triggered based on the
    target's state and combat context. It integrates with the overall AI decision-making
    process to ensure appropriate tactical behavior during combat. The method typically
    operates within the warrior's AI update cycle and may involve checking for ability
    cooldowns, targeting requirements, and stance validity before executing any actions.
  parameters:
  - name: stance
    description: The current warrior stance enum value indicating which stance the
      AI is currently in. Valid values include BattleStance, DefensiveStance, and
      BerserkerStance.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Unit that the warrior AI is engaging or considering
      for ability application. Can be nullptr if no valid target exists.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic stance-specific ability handling
    code: "void ExampleUsage(WarriorAI* ai, Unit* target)\n{\n    WarriorStance currentStance\
      \ = ai->GetStance();\n    ai->HandleStanceSpecificAbilities(currentStance, target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional stance ability execution
    code: "void AdvancedUsage(WarriorAI* ai)\n{\n    Unit* target = ai->GetVictim();\n\
      \    if (target && target->IsAlive())\n    {\n        WarriorStance stance =\
      \ ai->GetStance();\n        ai->HandleStanceSpecificAbilities(stance, target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update loop and should not
    be invoked directly unless within a controlled AI execution context. The implementation
    relies on the warrior's current stance state being properly maintained by the
    AI system. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary ability checks
    when stance or target conditions are invalid.
  warnings: Invoking this method with an invalid stance enum value may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the target pointer is valid and alive before calling to
    prevent null reference exceptions. This method assumes proper stance state management
    by the AI system.
