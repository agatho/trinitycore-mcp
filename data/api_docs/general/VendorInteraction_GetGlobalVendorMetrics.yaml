documentation:
  brief: Retrieves global vendor metrics for the current vendor interaction session
  description: The GetGlobalVendorMetrics method returns a VendorMetrics object containing
    aggregated statistics and performance data related to the current vendor interaction.
    This includes information such as transaction counts, revenue generated, item
    popularity, and other relevant business metrics that track the effectiveness and
    usage patterns of the vendor system. The returned metrics are typically used for
    administrative monitoring, performance analysis, and game economy tracking purposes
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A VendorMetrics object containing global vendor statistics including transaction
    counts, revenue data, item popularity metrics, and other relevant performance
    indicators for the current vendor interaction session.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'VendorMetrics metrics = vendorInteraction.GetGlobalVendorMetrics();

      uint32 totalTransactions = metrics.GetTransactionCount();

      uint64 totalRevenue = metrics.GetTotalRevenue();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may aggregate data from multiple sources including local session
    data, database records, and cached vendor information. The returned metrics object
    should be treated as read-only for most use cases. Performance impact is minimal
    as the data is typically cached or pre-aggregated.
  warnings: Ensure that the VendorInteraction object is properly initialized before
    calling this method. Accessing metrics from an uninitialized or invalid vendor
    interaction session may result in undefined behavior or empty metric values.
