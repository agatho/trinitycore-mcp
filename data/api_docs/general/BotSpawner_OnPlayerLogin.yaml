  brief: Handles player login events for bot spawning functionality
  description: The OnPlayerLogin method is triggered when a player successfully logs
    into the game world. This method initializes or updates bot-related data structures
    and ensures that any configured bots are properly managed for the logging-in player.
    It typically handles tasks such as loading saved bot configurations, setting up
    necessary game state variables, and potentially spawning initial bots if configured
    to do so upon login. The method is part of the BotSpawner class which manages
    automated player characters (bots) within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Basic usage in event handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    BotSpawner::OnPlayerLogin();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the TrinityCore core system
    during player login process. Developers should not call this directly unless implementing
    custom login logic. The method may perform database operations to load bot data,
    so performance considerations apply for servers with many bots.
