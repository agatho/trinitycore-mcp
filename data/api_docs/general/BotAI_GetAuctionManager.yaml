documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the auction manager instance used by the bot AI.
  description: The GetAuctionManager method provides access to the AuctionManager
    object that handles auction-related functionality within the bot's AI context.
    This manager is responsible for managing auctions, retrieving auction data, and
    interacting with the auction house system on behalf of the bot. The returned pointer
    is constant, indicating that the method does not modify the auction manager instance
    but rather provides read-only access to it. This method is typically used internally
    by the bot AI to perform auction-related operations such as browsing auctions,
    placing bids, or listing items for sale.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the AuctionManager instance associated with this BotAI
    object. Returns nullptr if no auction manager has been initialized or if the bot
    AI is not configured for auction functionality.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const AuctionManager* auctionMgr = botAI->GetAuctionManager();\nif (auctionMgr\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use auction manager to perform auction operations\n\
      \    auctionMgr->GetAuctions();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "const AuctionManager* auctionMgr = botAI->GetAuctionManager();\nif (auctionMgr)\n\
      {\n    // Perform auction house operations\n    uint32 auctionCount = auctionMgr->GetAuctionCount();\n\
      \    // Process auctions...\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where auction manager\
      \ is not available\n    sLog->outError(\"BotAI: Auction manager not initialized\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned AuctionManager pointer should be used with caution as it's tied
    to the lifetime of the BotAI instance. The method is thread-safe in the context
    of TrinityCore's architecture, but direct manipulation of the AuctionManager through
    this interface may require proper locking mechanisms depending on usage context.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or delete the returned AuctionManager pointer.
    Accessing auction data without checking for null can lead to crashes. The auction
    manager might be nullptr if the bot AI is not properly initialized with auction
    capabilities.
