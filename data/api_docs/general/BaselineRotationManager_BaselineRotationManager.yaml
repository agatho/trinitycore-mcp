  method: BaselineRotationManager
  signature: void BaselineRotationManager::BaselineRotationManager()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BaselineRotationManager class for handling
    AI combat rotation logic.
  description: The BaselineRotationManager constructor initializes the core components
    and data structures required for managing baseline combat rotations in World of
    Warcraft's AI system. This method sets up internal state tracking for spell casting
    sequences, cooldown management, and target selection logic that forms the foundation
    of NPC combat behavior. The initialization process ensures all necessary variables
    are properly configured before the rotation manager begins evaluating and executing
    combat actions during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BaselineRotationManager instance
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager* rotationManager = new BaselineRotationManager();

      // The object is now ready to manage combat rotations for an AI-controlled unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during the initialization phase of
    an AI-controlled creature or during the creation of a new combat rotation context.
    The manager will not function properly if initialized without proper game context
    or if used outside of a valid AI subsystem.
