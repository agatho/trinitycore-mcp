  brief: Cleans up GameObject resources before deletion
  description: The CleanupsBeforeDelete method performs necessary cleanup operations
    on a GameObject instance before it is removed from memory. This includes releasing
    references to associated data, clearing internal caches, and ensuring proper resource
    management. The method is typically called during the object's destruction process
    to prevent memory leaks and maintain game stability. It may also handle final
    cleanup tasks depending on whether this is a final cleanup or not.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      // ... perform operations ...

      go->CleanupsBeforeDelete(true);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any GameObject deletion to ensure proper
    cleanup. It's part of the standard object lifecycle in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Improper use can lead to memory leaks or crashes if cleanup is skipped
    during deletion process.
