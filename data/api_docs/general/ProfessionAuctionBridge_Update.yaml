  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: Update
  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::Update(int * player, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the profession auction bridge state based on elapsed time and player
    data.
  description: The Update method in the ProfessionAuctionBridge class is responsible
    for maintaining the state of profession-related auctions within the game world.
    It processes time-based events, handles player interactions, and ensures that
    auction listings are properly managed according to game mechanics. This method
    typically gets called during the game loop to synchronize auction data with real-time
    changes such as bid updates, expiration timers, or player activity. The method
    accepts a pointer to a player object and a time difference value to determine
    how much time has passed since the last update cycle.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object associated with the auction bridge.
      This parameter is used to access player-specific auction data and state information.
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since the last update cycle. Used
      to calculate time-based events such as auction expiration or bid processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 diff = 1000; // One second

      ProfessionAuctionBridge::Update(player, diff);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    if (player && player->GetSession())\n    {\n        ProfessionAuctionBridge::Update(player,\
      \ diff);\n    }\n    // ... more update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or update system.
    It's important to ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this
    function to avoid undefined behavior. The diff parameter should represent actual
    elapsed time in milliseconds for accurate auction timing.
  warnings: Passing a null player pointer will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the player object is fully initialized and has an active session before
    invoking this method. Incorrect diff values can lead to inaccurate auction timers
    or missed events.
