  class: MLPerformanceSample
  method: GetThroughput
  signature: float MLPerformanceSample::GetThroughput() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the throughput value of the performance sample.
  description: The GetThroughput method computes and retrieves the throughput metric
    associated with the MLPerformanceSample instance. This value typically represents
    the rate at which data or operations are processed within a given time frame,
    often used for monitoring system performance or machine learning model efficiency.
    The method is read-only and does not modify any internal state of the object.
    It assumes that the sample has been properly initialized with relevant performance
    data prior to calling.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated throughput. The unit of measurement
    depends on the context in which the MLPerformanceSample is used, but commonly
    reflects operations per second or bytes processed per second.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MLPerformanceSample sample;

      float throughput = sample.GetThroughput();

      std::cout << "Throughput: " << throughput << " ops/sec" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorPerformance() {\n    MLPerformanceSample sample;\n    // Simulate\
      \ some processing\n    float throughput = sample.GetThroughput();\n    if (throughput\
      \ < 100.0f) {\n        std::cerr << \"Warning: Low throughput detected!\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not introduce significant
    overhead during execution. It relies on internal timing and data counters that
    must be properly maintained by the caller or underlying system for accurate results.
  warnings: Ensure that the MLPerformanceSample object has been initialized with valid
    performance data before calling this method, otherwise the returned value may
    be undefined or misleading.
