  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: EvaluateFitness
  signature: void RoleOptimizer::EvaluateFitness(Chromosome & chromosome, const int
    & players, OptimizationGoal goal)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the fitness of a given chromosome based on player count and optimization
    goal for role distribution.
  description: The EvaluateFitness method computes a fitness score for a provided
    Chromosome object, which represents a potential solution in a genetic algorithm
    used for optimizing player roles in World of Warcraft groups. It takes into account
    the number of players and a specified optimization goal to determine how well
    the chromosome's role assignments meet the desired criteria. This method is typically
    used within the context of group composition optimization where the fitness score
    helps guide the evolution process toward better solutions. The evaluation considers
    factors such as role balance, player capabilities, and team synergy based on the
    defined goal.
  parameters:
  - name: chromosome
    description: Reference to a Chromosome object containing role assignments for
      players that will be evaluated for fitness.
  - name: players
    description: Integer representing the total number of players in the group being
      optimized.
  - name: goal
    description: OptimizationGoal enum value specifying the desired outcome for role
      distribution (e.g., optimal DPS, tank balance, heal efficiency).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fitness Evaluation
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      Chromosome chrom;

      int playerCount = 5;

      OptimizationGoal goal = OPTIMIZE_DPS;

      optimizer.EvaluateFitness(chrom, playerCount, goal);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Evaluating Different Optimization Goals
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      Chromosome chrom1, chrom2;

      int playerCount = 8;


      // Evaluate for DPS optimization

      optimizer.EvaluateFitness(chrom1, playerCount, OPTIMIZE_DPS);


      // Evaluate for tank balance

      optimizer.EvaluateFitness(chrom2, playerCount, OPTIMIZE_TANKS);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the chromosome's fitness score internally. The evaluation
    process may involve complex calculations based on role priorities and player attributes.
    Performance can be impacted when dealing with large player counts or complex optimization
    goals.
  warnings: Ensure that the chromosome contains valid role assignments before calling
    this method, as invalid data may lead to incorrect fitness evaluations. The method
    assumes all players have been properly initialized with their respective roles.
