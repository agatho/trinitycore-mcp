  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: GetObstaclesOnPath
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GetObstaclesOnPath(const int & start, const
    int & end)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of obstacles detected along a path between
    two points.
  description: The GetObstaclesOnPath method determines how many navigational obstacles
    are located on the direct path from a starting point to an ending point. This
    method is typically used in AI pathfinding and obstacle avoidance systems within
    TrinityCore's movement engine. It evaluates the spatial relationship between the
    start and end coordinates, checking for any solid objects or terrain features
    that would block movement along that line. The result indicates how many such
    obstacles exist, which can be used to determine whether alternative routes should
    be considered or if the path is viable.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting coordinate of the path. This represents the x or y position
      in the world coordinate system.
  - name: end
    description: The ending coordinate of the path. This represents the x or y position
      in the world coordinate system.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of obstacles found along the
    path from start to end. A value of 0 indicates no obstacles were detected, while
    a positive integer signifies the number of obstacles encountered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle detection
    code: "int obstacleCount = obstacleManager.GetObstaclesOnPath(100, 200);\nif (obstacleCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Handle path with obstacles\n    std::cout << \"Found \" <<\
      \ obstacleCount << \" obstacles on the path.\";\n} else {\n    // Path is clear\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Path is clear of obstacles.\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs spatial queries against the navigation mesh or
    collision data. It may be computationally expensive depending on the complexity
    of the terrain and number of obstacles in the area. The method assumes that both
    start and end parameters are valid coordinates within the same map instance.
  warnings: The method signature shows parameters as const int&, but the actual implementation
    might expect coordinate pairs or vector objects. Using invalid coordinates could
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure proper coordinate system
    alignment when calling this method.
