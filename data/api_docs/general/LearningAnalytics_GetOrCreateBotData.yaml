  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: GetOrCreateBotData
  signature: BotLearningData * LearningAnalytics::GetOrCreateBotData(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves or creates bot learning data for a specified bot GUID.
  description: The GetOrCreateBotData method retrieves an existing BotLearningData
    object associated with the given bot GUID, or creates a new one if it does not
    already exist. This method is used in the context of learning analytics for AI-controlled
    bots within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that each bot has a corresponding
    data structure for tracking its learning progress and behavior patterns. The method
    typically operates within a data management system where bot learning data is
    stored and accessed by unique identifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to retrieve or
      create learning data. This value must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer representing
      a bot's unique ID in the game world.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the BotLearningData object associated with the specified
    bot GUID. If no such data exists, it creates and returns a new instance. The method
    will return NULL if the input GUID is invalid or if memory allocation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nBotLearningData* data = analytics->GetOrCreateBotData(botGuid);\n\
      if (data)\n{\n    // Use the bot learning data\n    data->RecordAction(\"move\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 0;\nBotLearningData* data = analytics->GetOrCreateBotData(botGuid);\n\
      if (!data)\n{\n    // Handle invalid GUID or allocation failure\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to retrieve or create bot learning data for GUID %u\", botGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded environment,
    but developers should verify the underlying implementation. The returned pointer
    should not be deleted directly as it's managed by the LearningAnalytics system.
    Performance considerations include potential memory allocation when creating new
    BotLearningData objects.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned pointer is always valid; check for NULL
    before using it. Avoid calling this method with invalid or zero GUIDs, which may
    lead to undefined behavior or memory issues.
