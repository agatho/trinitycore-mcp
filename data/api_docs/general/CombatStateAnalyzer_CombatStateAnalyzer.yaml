  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: CombatStateAnalyzer
  signature: void CombatStateAnalyzer::CombatStateAnalyzer(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CombatStateAnalyzer instance with the specified player bot
    for combat analysis.
  description: The CombatStateAnalyzer constructor initializes internal state tracking
    for analyzing combat behavior of a given player bot. This method sets up necessary
    data structures and references to monitor the bot's combat-related activities,
    including attack patterns, target selection, and engagement states. The analyzer
    is designed to work within the TrinityCore framework and integrates with the game's
    combat system to provide insights into AI decision-making during battles. It prepares
    the object for subsequent analysis operations by establishing baseline combat
    parameters and player context.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose combat state
      will be analyzed. Must not be null and should represent a valid player instance
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat State Analyzer Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player

      CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer(myBot);

      // The analyzer is now ready to analyze combat behavior of ''myBot'''
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any immediate analysis or data collection.
    It merely initializes the object with the provided player reference and prepares
    internal tracking mechanisms. The actual combat state analysis must be performed
    through other methods like Update() or AnalyzeCombat(). This implementation assumes
    that the Player object remains valid throughout the lifetime of the CombatStateAnalyzer
    instance.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the bot parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Player object is properly initialized and
    exists in the game world before creating a CombatStateAnalyzer instance with it.
    Also, be aware that this class may not be thread-safe if used concurrently from
    multiple threads.
