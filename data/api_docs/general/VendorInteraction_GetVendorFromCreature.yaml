  class: VendorInteraction
  method: GetVendorFromCreature
  signature: VendorInfo VendorInteraction::GetVendorFromCreature(const Creature *
    creature)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves vendor information associated with a creature in the game world.
  description: The GetVendorFromCreature method fetches the VendorInfo structure that
    contains all relevant data about a creature's vendor inventory and related settings.
    This includes items available for purchase, vendor flags, and other trade-related
    properties. The method is typically used during vendor interaction events to determine
    what goods a specific NPC offers to players. It requires a valid Creature pointer
    and will return an empty VendorInfo structure if no vendor data is found or if
    the creature is not a vendor.
  parameters: []
  returns: A VendorInfo object containing all vendor-related data for the specified
    creature, including item lists, vendor flags, and trade settings. Returns an empty
    VendorInfo if the creature does not have vendor data or if the input is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Vendor Interaction
    code: "Creature* vendorCreature = player->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(targetGuid,\
      \ UNIT_NPC_FLAG_VENDOR);\nif (vendorCreature)\n{\n    VendorInfo vendorData\
      \ = VendorInteraction::GetVendorFromCreature(vendorCreature);\n    if (!vendorData.empty())\n\
      \    {\n        // Process vendor items\n        for (auto& item : vendorData)\n\
      \        {\n            // Handle each vendor item\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally accesses the creature's database entries and may involve
    database lookups. It should be used carefully in performance-critical sections
    of code. The returned VendorInfo structure is typically cached or pre-fetched
    during vendor initialization to avoid repeated database queries.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null before calling. Passing an invalid pointer may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. This method does not perform any validation on the creature's NPC
    flags, so it's recommended to verify that the creature actually has vendor capabilities
    before calling.
