  brief: Destroys a ScopedDifficultyAdjustment object and restores the previous difficulty
    setting.
  description: The destructor for the ScopedDifficultyAdjustment class is responsible
    for cleaning up the object's resources and restoring the game difficulty level
    that was active before this adjustment was applied. This class is typically used
    to temporarily modify the difficulty of a game scenario or encounter, ensuring
    that the original difficulty setting is automatically restored when the object
    goes out of scope. The destructor ensures proper cleanup and maintains consistency
    in game state management.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    // Temporarily adjust difficulty\n    ScopedDifficultyAdjustment\
      \ adjustment(DIFFICULTY_HEROIC);\n    \n    // Perform heroic difficulty actions\
      \ here\n    // ...\n    \n    // When adjustment goes out of scope, difficulty\
      \ is restored automatically\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is implicitly called when a ScopedDifficultyAdjustment object
    goes out of scope. It's designed to work with RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    principles to ensure automatic cleanup and state restoration.
