  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: CalculateDistance3D
  signature: float LineOfSightManager::CalculateDistance3D(const int & from, const
    int & to)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the three-dimensional straight-line distance between two points
    in the game world.
  description: 'The CalculateDistance3D method computes the Euclidean distance between
    two points in three-dimensional space, typically represented by their x, y, and
    z coordinates. This function is commonly used in World of Warcraft''s TrinityCore
    to determine spatial relationships between game entities such as players, NPCs,
    or objects. It performs a simple mathematical calculation using the 3D distance
    formula: sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2). The method assumes that both
    input parameters correspond to valid coordinates within the game world''s coordinate
    system and returns a floating-point value representing the distance in yards.
    This calculation is essential for various gameplay mechanics including line-of-sight
    checks, range-based spell casting, and AI behavior decisions.'
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The identifier or reference point for the starting location. In TrinityCore
      context, this typically represents a GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  - name: to
    description: The identifier or reference point for the destination location. Similar
      to 'from', this is usually a GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  returns: A float value representing the straight-line distance in yards between
    the two specified points in three-dimensional space. Returns 0.0 if both points
    are identical or if either point reference is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distance Calculation
    code: "float distance = lineOfSightManager.CalculateDistance3D(playerGUID, npcGUID);\n\
      if (distance < 10.0f) {\n    // Player is within 10 yards of NPC\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Line-of-Sight Checks
    code: "float distance = lineOfSightManager.CalculateDistance3D(playerGUID, targetGUID);\n\
      if (distance > 50.0f) {\n    // Check if player can see target through line\
      \ of sight\n    bool isLOS = lineOfSightManager.IsInLineOfSight(playerGUID,\
      \ targetGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct distance calculation without considering terrain
    height differences or obstacles. For accurate line-of-sight determination, use
    IsInLineOfSight() in conjunction with CalculateDistance3D(). The method may return
    inaccurate results if used with invalid GUIDs or if the referenced entities have
    not been properly initialized in the game world.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on distance calculations for gameplay logic that requires
    precise spatial awareness. Always validate input parameters and handle potential
    errors when working with entity references. Using this function with uninitialized
    or destroyed entities may result in undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
