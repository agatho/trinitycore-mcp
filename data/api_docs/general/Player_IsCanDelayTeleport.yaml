documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player can delay teleportation events.
  description: The IsCanDelayTeleport method checks if a player is currently allowed
    to delay or postpone teleportation actions. This functionality is typically used
    during combat, movement, or other game states where immediate teleportation might
    be disruptive or inappropriate. The method evaluates various player conditions
    such as being in combat, affected by certain spells, or in specific game states
    that prevent teleportation delays. It returns true if the player can delay teleportation,
    and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is allowed to delay teleportation events; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if player can delay teleport
    code: "if (player->IsCanDelayTeleport()) {\n    // Allow teleport delay logic\n\
      \    player->SetTeleportDelay(5000); // Delay teleport by 5 seconds\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with immediate teleport\n    player->TeleportTo(mapId, x,\
      \ y, z, orientation);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore core to manage
    teleportation behavior during critical game states. It's important to note that
    even if this returns true, additional checks may still be performed before allowing
    a delay.
