  class: Player
  method: SetHonorLevel
  signature: void Player::SetHonorLevel(uint8 honorLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's honor level to the specified value.
  description: This method allows developers to directly set a player's honor level,
    which affects their reputation with various factions and their ability to earn
    honor points. The honor level is typically used in conjunction with other honor-related
    methods like SetHonorPoints to control a player's progression in the game's honor
    system. This method does not trigger any automatic updates or notifications to
    the client; it simply modifies the internal state of the player object.
  parameters:
  - name: honorLevel
    description: The new honor level to set for the player, ranging from 0 to 255.
      Values beyond this range may cause unexpected behavior or errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetHonorLevel(10);

      // Sets the player''s honor level to 10'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint8 newHonorLevel = 25;

      player->SetHonorLevel(newHonorLevel);

      // Sets the player''s honor level to 25, affecting their faction reputation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it bypasses normal game progression
    mechanics. It may affect the player's ability to earn honor points and could potentially
    disrupt balance if not used properly.
  warnings: Setting a player's honor level to values beyond the expected range (0-255)
    can cause unexpected behavior or errors in faction reputation system.
