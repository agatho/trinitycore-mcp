  class: RogueCombatPositioning
  method: RogueCombatPositioning
  signature: void RogueCombatPositioning::RogueCombatPositioning(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Positions the rogue bot in optimal combat stance based on target distance
    and threat level
  description: The RogueCombatPositioning method adjusts the bot's positioning strategy
    to maximize combat effectiveness. It evaluates the distance to the current target,
    assesses threat levels, and determines whether the rogue should maintain melee
    range, use stealth for positioning, or reposition for optimal attack angles. This
    method is typically called during combat scenarios to ensure the rogue maintains
    an advantageous position relative to enemies.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot object that will be positioned. Must not be null
      and should represent a valid rogue class instance.
  returns: No return value. The method modifies the bot's positioning state directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: 'RogueCombatPositioning* positioning = new RogueCombatPositioning();

      int* rogueBot = &playerBot->GetGUID();

      positioning->RogueCombatPositioning(rogueBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI state tracking and should only be called
    during active combat situations. The positioning logic considers factors such
    as target mobility, available stealth abilities, and environmental obstacles.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid bot pointer may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure the bot is in a valid combat state before invoking this method.
