  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetTimeSinceLastSeen
  signature: int LeaderFollowBehavior::GetTimeSinceLastSeen() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time elapsed since the leader was last seen by the follower in
    milliseconds.
  description: The GetTimeSinceLastSeen method calculates and returns the number of
    milliseconds that have passed since the leader unit was last observed by the follower
    unit. This is typically used in AI behavior systems to determine how long a follower
    has been without visual contact with its leader, which can influence decision-making
    such as repositioning or alert status changes. The value is updated whenever the
    follower detects the leader through vision or other sensory mechanisms. This method
    does not perform any internal state updates; it simply reports the stored time
    delta.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of milliseconds since the leader was
    last seen. Returns 0 if the leader has never been seen, or a positive value indicating
    elapsed time since last sighting.
  examples:
  - title: Check if leader has been seen recently
    code: "if (follower->GetTimeSinceLastSeen() < 5000) {\n    // Leader seen within\
      \ the last 5 seconds\n    follower->MoveToLeader();\n} else {\n    // Leader\
      \ not seen for more than 5 seconds\n    follower->SetState(FOLLOWER_STATE_LOST);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of the last seen timestamp, which
    is updated by vision or detection systems. It's important to note that this value
    may not reflect actual real-time conditions if the AI system does not regularly
    update the last seen state.
