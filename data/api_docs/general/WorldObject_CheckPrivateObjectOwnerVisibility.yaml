api:
  class: WorldObject
  method: CheckPrivateObjectOwnerVisibility
  signature: bool WorldObject::CheckPrivateObjectOwnerVisibility(const WorldObject
    * seer) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the private object owner visibility is enabled for the
    specified seer.
  description: This method checks if the private object owner visibility is enabled
    for a given WorldObject, which typically represents a player or creature in the
    game. It evaluates whether the current object's visibility settings allow the
    seer to see the private object owner's data. This functionality is crucial for
    determining visibility of private objects such as pets, vehicles, or other controlled
    entities in World of Warcraft, particularly when dealing with player-controlled
    creatures or objects that may have specific visibility rules based on their relationship
    with the seer.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: The WorldObject that is attempting to view the private object owner.
      This parameter represents the observer or viewer in the visibility context.
  returns: Returns true if the private object owner visibility is enabled for the
    seer, false otherwise. This indicates whether the current object's visibility
    settings allow the seer to access the private object owner's data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (object->CheckPrivateObjectOwnerVisibility(player)) {\n    // Do something\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other visibility-related
    methods and may be part of a larger system for determining object visibility.
    Implementation details include checking the object's owner's visibility settings,
    which can vary based on the type of object and its relationship to the seer.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without understanding the broader
    context of visibility systems in TrinityCore. Incorrect usage may lead to unexpected
    behavior when determining visibility of controlled objects.
