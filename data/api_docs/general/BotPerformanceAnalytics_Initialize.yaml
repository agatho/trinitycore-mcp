  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotPerformanceAnalytics::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot performance analytics system, setting up internal data
    structures and preparing for tracking bot behavior metrics.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotPerformanceAnalytics class for
    tracking and collecting performance data from game bots. It sets up necessary
    internal data structures, registers required event handlers, and ensures all subsystems
    are ready to monitor bot behavior. This method should be called once during server
    startup or when the analytics system needs to be activated. The initialization
    process may involve allocating memory, opening log files, or establishing connections
    to performance monitoring services. If initialization fails, subsequent calls
    to analytics methods may not function correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all internal components
    were properly set up. Returns false if any critical component failed to initialize,
    which typically indicates a system resource issue or configuration error that
    prevents proper operation of the performance analytics system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nbool success = analytics.Initialize();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Analytics system is ready for use\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\"\
      , \"Bot performance analytics initialized successfully\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle initialization failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Failed to initialize\
      \ bot performance analytics\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when the analytics
    system needs to be enabled. It's important to check the return value to ensure
    proper initialization before using other analytics methods. The method may perform
    blocking operations during setup, so it should not be called from time-critical
    code paths.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    resource leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure that any previous analytics state
    is properly disposed of before reinitializing. This method might fail if required
    system resources (like file handles or memory) are unavailable.
