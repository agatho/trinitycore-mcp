documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the efficiency of empowerment effects for the evoker AI.
  description: The AnalyzeEmpowermentEfficiency method assesses how effectively the
    evoker AI utilizes empowerment mechanics during combat. This internal method likely
    evaluates the current state of empowerment buffs, their duration, and potential
    impact on spell casting decisions. It may be used to determine optimal timing
    for empowerment-related abilities or to adjust strategy based on empowerment status.
    The method operates within the broader context of the EvokerAI's decision-making
    framework, potentially influencing which spells are prioritized or when specific
    empowerment effects should be applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    AnalyzeEmpowermentEfficiency();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the AI system during combat updates
    and may influence spell selection or timing decisions. It's part of the evoker's
    strategic decision-making process rather than a direct action.
