  method: IsInviterInRange
  signature: bool GroupInvitationHandler::IsInviterInRange(Player * inviter) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the group inviter is within the acceptable range for inviting players
    to a group
  description: The IsInviterInRange method determines whether a given player (the
    inviter) is within the valid distance range to invite another player into a group.
    This check is essential for preventing players from inviting others across large
    distances in the game world, maintaining gameplay balance and preventing exploitation.
    The method typically evaluates the physical distance between the inviter and the
    target player, ensuring they are within the limits defined by the game's group
    invitation system. It may also consider other factors such as whether both players
    are in the same instance or map, though this depends on the specific implementation
    details.
  parameters:
  - name: inviter
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is attempting
      to invite another player into a group. This parameter must not be null and should
      represent an active player in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the inviter is within the acceptable range for group invitation,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically means that either the players
    are too far apart or some other condition (such as being in different instances)
    prevents the invitation from proceeding.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player can invite another
    code: "Player* inviter = ...; // Get the inviter player object\nif (groupHandler.IsInviterInRange(inviter))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with group invitation logic\n    groupHandler.InvitePlayer(inviter,\
      \ targetPlayer);\n} else {\n    // Notify the inviter that they are too far\
      \ away\n    inviter->SendNotification(\"You are too far away to invite this\
      \ player.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a group invitation flow with error handling
    code: "void HandleGroupInvite(Player* inviter, Player* target) {\n    if (!inviter\
      \ || !target) return;\n    \n    GroupInvitationHandler handler;\n    if (handler.IsInviterInRange(inviter))\
      \ {\n        // Check if the target is already in a group\n        if (target->GetGroup())\
      \ {\n            inviter->SendNotification(\"Player is already in a group.\"\
      );\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        // Proceed with invitation\n\
      \        handler.InvitePlayer(inviter, target);\n    } else {\n        inviter->SendNotification(\"\
      You must be closer to invite this player.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the game's built-in distance calculation functions
    and may take into account instance boundaries, map restrictions, or other environmental
    factors. It is commonly used in conjunction with other group-related methods to
    ensure proper group management and prevent abuse of the invitation system.
  warnings: Ensure that the inviter parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Failing to do so could result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also,
    be aware that distance checks may vary depending on the specific game version
    and server configuration.
