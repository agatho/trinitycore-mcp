  class: EnhancementShamanRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void EnhancementShamanRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32
    enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the enhancement shaman's AoE rotation logic based on target count
    and enemy proximity.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for an enhancement
    shaman's area-of-effect combat rotation. It evaluates the current combat situation,
    including the number of enemies within range and their positioning, to determine
    the optimal sequence of spells and abilities to maximize damage output in AoE
    scenarios. This method typically utilizes the shaman's available spells such as
    Lava Burst, Chain Lightning, and Earth Shock, prioritizing them based on cooldowns,
    mana efficiency, and enemy density. The implementation considers factors like
    spell range, targeting mechanics, and the shaman's current resource levels to
    ensure efficient and effective AoE damage execution.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of target GUIDs or identifiers representing enemies
      within the AoE range. The method uses this to determine optimal spell targeting
      order and to assess enemy clustering for Chain Lightning usage.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: The total number of enemies currently within the shaman's effective
      AoE range. This value determines which abilities are prioritized and how many
      targets can be hit by multi-target spells like Chain Lightning.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: "void ExecuteAoERotation(int* target, uint32 enemyCount) {\n    // Example\
      \ implementation logic\n    if (enemyCount >= 3) {\n        // Use Chain Lightning\
      \ for multiple targets\n        DoCastSpell(ChainLightning);\n    } else {\n\
      \        // Use Lava Burst or Earth Shock for single targets\n        DoCastSpell(LavaBurst);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat when multiple enemies are present.
    The shaman's AI must account for spell range limitations, cooldown management,
    and resource consumption to maintain optimal rotation efficiency.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target array or enemy count can lead to incorrect
    targeting or missed opportunities for high-damage AoE spells. Ensure that the
    target array is properly populated before calling this method.
