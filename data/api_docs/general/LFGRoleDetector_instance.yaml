documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the LFGRoleDetector class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the LFGRoleDetector
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application.
    This method is used to access the global LFGRoleDetector object which handles
    role detection logic for Looking For Group (LFG) activities in World of Warcraft.
    The method performs lazy initialization, creating the instance on first call if
    it does not already exist. This is commonly used within LFG systems to determine
    appropriate roles for players based on their character's stats, gear, and other
    criteria.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton LFGRoleDetector instance. The method will never
    return a null pointer as it ensures instantiation on first access.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the LFG Role Detector
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector* roleDetector = LFGRoleDetector::instance();

      // Use roleDetector to determine player roles for LFG activities'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Role Detector in LFG Context
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector* detector = LFGRoleDetector::instance();

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint8 role = detector->DetectRole(player);

      // Process the detected role for LFG matching'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it uses a static local variable for singleton
    instantiation, which is guaranteed to be initialized only once in C++11 and later.
    The LFGRoleDetector instance should be accessed through this method rather than
    creating new instances directly.
