documentation:
  brief: Destroys a QuestAcceptanceManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The QuestAcceptanceManager destructor is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources held by the manager. This includes cleaning up any internal
    data structures, unregistering event handlers, and ensuring no dangling pointers
    remain. The destructor is automatically invoked when a QuestAcceptanceManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of
    quest acceptance-related state and prevents memory leaks within the TrinityCore
    framework.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of QuestAcceptanceManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    QuestAcceptanceManager manager;\n    // ...\
      \ use manager ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It's important to ensure that all references to the manager are cleared
    before it goes out of scope to avoid potential dangling references.
