documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum number of players required to start the battleground.
  description: The GetMinPlayers method retrieves the minimum player count needed
    for a battleground to begin. This value is defined per battleground type and ensures
    that matches do not start with insufficient participation. The method is commonly
    used during battleground queue management and pre-start validation logic. It returns
    an integer representing the required number of players, which can vary between
    different battleground types such as Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, or Eye of the
    Storm.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the minimum number of players required to initiate
    the battleground match. This value is typically 10 for most battlegrounds but
    may differ based on specific battleground type and configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Check Minimum Players Before Starting
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg &&\
      \ bg->GetMinPlayers() <= bg->GetPlayerCount()) {\n    // Proceed with battleground\
      \ start logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context where a battleground
    instance is available. The returned value is constant for the lifetime of a battleground
    instance and does not change during gameplay.
