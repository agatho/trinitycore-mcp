  class: UnitAI
  method: AttackStart
  signature: void UnitAI::AttackStart(Unit * victim)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior against a specified target unit.
  description: The AttackStart method is used by UnitAI to begin attacking a given
    victim unit. It triggers the AI's combat behavior, setting up the necessary state
    for the unit to engage in combat with the specified target. This method typically
    handles the initial setup of the attack sequence, including updating the unit's
    threat table, initiating melee or ranged attacks depending on the unit's configuration,
    and ensuring that the AI properly transitions into an aggressive state towards
    the victim. The method does not directly perform damage calculations but rather
    initiates the combat mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: A pointer to the Unit object that this AI-controlled unit will begin
      attacking. Must be a valid, non-null Unit instance. If null is passed, the behavior
      is undefined and may result in crashes or unexpected AI behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Start Usage
    code: 'Unit* target = ...; // Some valid Unit pointer

      ai->AttackStart(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Attack Start
    code: "if (victim && victim->IsAlive())\n{\n    ai->AttackStart(victim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a unit detects
    a threat or when combat is initiated. It's important to ensure that the victim
    unit is valid and alive before calling AttackStart, as passing invalid pointers
    can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the victim parameter will likely cause a crash
    or unpredictable behavior in the AI system. Always validate that the target unit
    exists and is in a valid state before invoking this method.
