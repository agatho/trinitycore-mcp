  brief: Loads game object data required for quest interactions.
  description: The LoadGameObjectForQuests method initializes and loads all game objects
    that are associated with quests in the TrinityCore database. This includes loading
    quest-related GameObject templates, their positions, and linking them to specific
    quest requirements or objectives. The method ensures that quest-related game objects
    are properly registered within the ObjectMgr system so they can be correctly referenced
    during quest progression, interaction, and completion events. It typically runs
    during server startup or world initialization to ensure all quest-related objects
    are available for player interactions.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadGameObjectForQuests();\n    // Continue with\
      \ other initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup as part of the world
    loading process. It may involve database queries to fetch quest-related GameObject
    entries and can impact startup time depending on the number of quest objects in
    the database.
