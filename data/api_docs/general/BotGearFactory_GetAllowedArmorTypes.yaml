documentation:
  brief: Returns the bitmask of allowed armor types for a specified class
  description: The GetAllowedArmorTypes method retrieves the bitmask representing
    which types of armor a given class can wear. This is used internally by the bot
    system to determine valid equipment choices when generating gear for AI-controlled
    characters. The returned value corresponds to the armor type flags defined in
    the game's constants, allowing for bitwise operations to check if a specific armor
    type is permitted for the class. This method is essential for ensuring that bots
    equip appropriate gear according to their class restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask where each bit represents a specific armor type. The
    bits correspond to cloth (1), leather (2), mail (4), plate (8), and shield (16)
    armor types. A value of 0 indicates no armor restrictions, while specific combinations
    indicate which armor types are allowed for the class.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a class can wear plate armor
    code: "int allowedTypes = factory->GetAllowedArmorTypes(CLASS_WARRIOR);\nif (allowedTypes\
      \ & ARMOR_TYPE_PLATE)\n{\n    // Warrior can wear plate armor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine all allowed armor types for a class
    code: 'uint8 playerClass = CLASS_MAGE;

      int armorMask = factory->GetAllowedArmorTypes(playerClass);

      std::cout << "Allowed armor types mask: " << armorMask << std::endl;

      // Output might be 3 (leather and cloth only for mages)

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches its results internally to avoid repeated calculations.
    The returned bitmask values are consistent with World of Warcraft's internal armor
    type definitions. The implementation may vary based on game expansion or patch
    versions.
  warnings: The return value should be interpreted using bitwise operations. Direct
    comparison against specific armor type constants without proper bit masking may
    lead to incorrect results. Ensure that the class parameter is a valid class identifier
    from the game's class enumeration.
