  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: ShouldRest
  signature: bool EnhancedBotAI::ShouldRest()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot should enter a resting state based on its current
    health, mana, and other conditions.
  description: The ShouldRest method evaluates the current state of the EnhancedBotAI
    instance to decide if it is appropriate for the bot to rest. This decision is
    typically made based on factors such as the bot's health and mana levels, whether
    it is in combat, and other contextual game states. The method returns true when
    resting is recommended, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for
    bots to maintain optimal performance by avoiding unnecessary combat or resource
    depletion during low-resource periods.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the bot should rest. Returns true if
    resting is advised based on internal conditions; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (botAI->ShouldRest()) {\n    // Initiate rest behavior\n    botAI->StartResting();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal state tracking variables such
    as health percentage, mana levels, and combat status. It may also consider environmental
    factors like proximity to a safe zone or rest locations.
