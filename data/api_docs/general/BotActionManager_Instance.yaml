  method: Instance
  signature: BotActionManager * BotActionManager::Instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotActionManager class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the BotActionManager
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access the global bot action management
    system that handles AI behaviors, command execution, and interaction logic for
    player-controlled bots in World of Warcraft. The returned pointer provides access
    to all bot-related actions and state management functions. This method should
    be called whenever bot-specific functionality needs to be accessed from different
    parts of the codebase.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotActionManager instance, or nullptr if the instance
    has not been initialized yet
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotActionManager singleton
    code: "BotActionManager* actionManager = BotActionManager::Instance();\nif (actionManager)\n\
      {\n    // Use the bot action manager\n    actionManager->ProcessBotActions();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using BotActionManager for bot command execution
    code: "BotActionManager* manager = BotActionManager::Instance();\nif (manager\
      \ && bot)\n{\n    // Execute a specific action for the bot\n    manager->ExecuteBotCommand(bot,\
      \ \"move_to_target\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard singleton pattern conventions. The instance
    is typically initialized during server startup or when the first bot is created.
    Multiple calls to this method will return the same pointer address, ensuring consistent
    access to the global bot action manager state.
  warnings: Ensure that the TrinityCore server has properly initialized the bot system
    before calling this method. Accessing the singleton before initialization may
    result in a nullptr return value and potential crashes if not properly checked.
