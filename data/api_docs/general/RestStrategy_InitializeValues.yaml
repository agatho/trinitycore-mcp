documentation:
  brief: Initializes internal values and state for the rest strategy behavior.
  description: The InitializeValues method sets up the initial configuration and state
    variables required for the RestStrategy to function properly. This method is typically
    called during the initialization phase of an AI behavior or when a new rest strategy
    instance is created. It ensures that all necessary parameters, thresholds, and
    internal flags are correctly configured before the strategy begins executing its
    logic. The method may also perform validation checks on input values and set default
    states for various rest-related conditions such as energy levels, health recovery
    rates, or environmental factors affecting rest behavior.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'RestStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeValues();

      // Strategy is now ready for use with default configuration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during object initialization before any
    other rest strategy operations are performed. It may internally access global
    configuration settings or player state data that could affect the behavior of
    subsequent calls.
