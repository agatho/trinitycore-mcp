documentation:
  brief: Establishes a link between the group instance reference and its target object.
  description: The targetObjectBuildLink method is responsible for creating or updating
    a reference link between a GroupInstanceReference object and its associated target
    object within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically ensures that the
    group instance maintains proper synchronization with the referenced target, which
    could be a player, creature, game object, or other entity in the world. It is
    commonly used during group creation, member addition, or when establishing relationships
    between group instances and their target entities. The method likely performs
    internal bookkeeping to track group membership and instance references.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group management
    code: 'GroupInstanceReference* reference = new GroupInstanceReference();

      reference->targetObjectBuildLink();

      // The reference is now linked to its target object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after initializing a GroupInstanceReference
    object but before attempting to perform operations that require the link to be
    established. It may internally trigger additional validation or synchronization
    processes.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the GroupInstanceReference
    object may result in undefined behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that all required
    fields are set before invoking this method.
