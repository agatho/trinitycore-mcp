  class: Trigger
  method: GetActionName
  signature: std::string Trigger::GetActionName() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name of the action associated with this trigger.
  description: The GetActionName method returns a std::string containing the name
    of the action that is linked to this Trigger object. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, triggers are often used in game events, quest systems,
    or scripted behaviors where an action needs to be identified by name for logging,
    debugging, or execution purposes. This method provides access to the action name
    without modifying the trigger's state. The returned string is typically used for
    identifying what action should be performed when the trigger condition is met.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string representing the name of the action associated with this
    trigger. If no action name has been set, an empty string may be returned depending
    on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Log Trigger Action
    code: 'Trigger* trigger = ...; // Assume trigger is initialized

      std::string actionName = trigger->GetActionName();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server.loading", "Trigger action: %s", actionName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Action Name for Conditional Logic
    code: "Trigger* trigger = ...;\nstd::string actionName = trigger->GetActionName();\n\
      if (actionName == \"TeleportPlayer\") {\n    // Handle teleportation logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a getter function and should be thread-safe if used
    in multi-threaded environments. It does not modify the internal state of the Trigger
    object, making it safe to call repeatedly.
