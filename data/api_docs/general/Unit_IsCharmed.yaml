  method: IsCharmed
  signature: bool Unit::IsCharmed() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently charmed by another entity.
  description: The IsCharmed method checks if the current Unit object is under the
    control of another creature or player, typically through charm effects such as
    those from spells like Mind Control or Enslave Demon. This method is commonly
    used in game mechanics to determine if a unit is subject to mind control or similar
    effects that restrict its autonomy. It returns true when the unit's state is influenced
    by an external entity, and false otherwise. The method is particularly useful
    in AI scripting and player behavior analysis where control over unit actions is
    required.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently charmed by another entity, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the unit's behavior is controlled by an external
    source rather than being autonomous.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsCharmed())\n{\n    // Unit is charmed, perform special actions\n\
      \    // Example: stop attacking, follow commands\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Unit is\
      \ not charmed, normal behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the unit's control status.
    It may be affected by various game mechanics including spell effects, aura states,
    and player-controlled entities. Performance considerations are minimal as this
    is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: The method does not account for all possible charm-related scenarios;
    it only checks for active charm state. Be aware that other control mechanisms
    (such as fear or pacification) may also affect unit behavior but are not covered
    by this method.
