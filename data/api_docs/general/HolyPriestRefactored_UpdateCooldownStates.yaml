  method: UpdateCooldownStates
  signature: void HolyPriestRefactored::UpdateCooldownStates()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all abilities and spells used by the Holy
    Priest.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers associated with all abilities, spells, and talents available
    to the Holy Priest class. This method typically iterates through the priest's
    spellbook or ability list, checking each spell's current cooldown status and updating
    internal tracking variables accordingly. It ensures that spells cannot be cast
    until their respective cooldown periods have expired, maintaining game balance
    and proper resource management. The method is commonly called during combat updates,
    tick intervals, or when specific conditions are met within the priest's AI logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void HolyPriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    if (m_updateCooldowns)\n        m_priest->UpdateCooldownStates();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Cooldown Update Trigger
    code: "void HolyPriestRefactored::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spell)\n{\n   \
      \ // Handle spell-specific logic\n    // ... \n    // Manually update cooldown\
      \ states after casting\n    UpdateCooldownStates();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    accurate cooldown tracking. It may involve iterating through a spell list or checking
    internal cooldown timers, so performance considerations are important for high-frequency
    updates. The method is likely part of a larger combat state management system
    and depends on proper initialization of spell cooldown data structures.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect spell availability
    checks, allowing players to cast spells before cooldowns expire. This may result
    in game balance issues or unexpected behavior in PvP scenarios. Ensure that all
    relevant cooldown data is properly initialized before calling this method.
