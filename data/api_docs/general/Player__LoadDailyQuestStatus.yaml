  brief: Loads daily quest status for the player
  description: This method initializes and loads the player's daily quest status information,
    including tracking which daily quests have been completed and which are available.
    It handles the internal data structures required for daily quest tracking and
    ensures proper synchronization with the game server state. The method is typically
    invoked during player login or when the player enters the world to ensure accurate
    quest tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_LoadDailyQuestStatus(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest system initialization and should
    only be called during player loading or when entering the world. It may involve
    database operations and should not be called repeatedly without proper synchronization.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code; it's an internal
    method used by the TrinityCore core. Calling it multiple times without proper
    synchronization could lead to data inconsistencies or duplicate quest tracking.
