  signature: uint32 InsanityTracker::GetInsanityPercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current insanity percentage value for the tracked
    entity.
  description: The GetInsanityPercent method retrieves the current insanity level
    of an entity as a percentage value. This method is typically used in game mechanics
    involving sanity or mental state tracking, such as in certain spells, abilities,
    or effects that modify a player's or creature's insanity status. The returned
    value represents how much of the maximum insanity has been accumulated, expressed
    as a whole number percentage. The method does not modify any internal state and
    is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current insanity level as a percentage.
    This value typically ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no insanity and 100
    represents maximum insanity. Values outside this range may indicate an error or
    special game state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 insanityPercent = tracker->GetInsanityPercent();\nif (insanityPercent\
      \ >= 75)\n{\n    // Apply effects for high insanity\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with UI Display
    code: 'InsanityTracker* tracker = player->GetInsanityTracker();

      uint32 percent = tracker->GetInsanityPercent();

      player->SendNotification("Your insanity level is: %u%%", percent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the InsanityTracker has been properly initialized
    and contains valid insanity data. The implementation likely relies on internal
    calculations based on accumulated insanity points versus maximum possible insanity.
    If used in a multi-threaded environment, ensure thread safety when accessing the
    tracker object.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned value will always be within the 0-100
    range; edge cases or special game states might produce unexpected values. The
    method should not be called on an uninitialized or invalid InsanityTracker instance,
    as this could lead to undefined behavior.
