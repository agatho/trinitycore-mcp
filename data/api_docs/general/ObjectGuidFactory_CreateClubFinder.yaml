  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateClubFinder
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateClubFinder(uint32 realmId, uint8
    type, uint32 clubFinderId, uint64 dbId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a unique ObjectGuid for a ClubFinder entity using specified
    realm, type, club ID, and database ID.
  description: The CreateClubFinder method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically
    designed for ClubFinder entities within the TrinityCore framework. This function
    constructs a GUID by combining the provided realm identifier, entity type, club
    finder identifier, and database ID into a standardized format that uniquely identifies
    ClubFinder-related objects across the game world. The generated GUID is typically
    used to reference or track ClubFinder instances such as clubs, applications, or
    related data structures in the game's object management system. This method ensures
    consistency and uniqueness of identifiers for ClubFinder functionality within
    the WoW server environment.
  parameters:
  - name: realmId
    description: The unique identifier of the realm where the ClubFinder entity exists.
      Must be a valid realm ID from the game database.
  - name: type
    description: The type identifier for the ClubFinder entity. This determines the
      specific category or subtype of the ClubFinder object being created (e.g., club,
      application).
  - name: clubFinderId
    description: A unique identifier for the specific ClubFinder instance. Used to
      distinguish between different clubs or ClubFinder entities within the same realm.
  - name: dbId
    description: The database ID of the underlying record in the ClubFinder table.
      This ensures that the GUID maps directly to a persistent database entry.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid object that uniquely identifies the ClubFinder entity
    across the game world. The returned GUID follows the standard TrinityCore GUID
    format with embedded realm, type, and identifier information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to create a ClubFinder GUID
    code: 'ObjectGuid clubGuid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateClubFinder(1, 5, 12345,
      987654321);

      // Creates a GUID for a ClubFinder club with ID 12345 in realm 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating multiple ClubFinder GUIDs for different entities
    code: 'ObjectGuid club1 = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateClubFinder(1, 5, 1001, 100000001);

      ObjectGuid club2 = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateClubFinder(1, 5, 1002, 100000002);

      // Creates two distinct GUIDs for different clubs in the same realm'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectGuidFactory class which centralizes GUID
    generation logic. The resulting GUIDs are compatible with TrinityCore's object
    tracking and database mapping systems. Ensure that all parameters are valid before
    calling this method to avoid incorrect GUID construction.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values may result in invalid or non-unique GUIDs.
    The type parameter should match expected ClubFinder entity types to maintain compatibility
    with game mechanics. Avoid reusing the same clubFinderId across different realms
    without proper validation.
