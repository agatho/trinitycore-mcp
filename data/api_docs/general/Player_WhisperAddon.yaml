documentation:
  brief: Sends a whisper message with addon prefix to another player
  description: The WhisperAddon method allows a player to send a whispered message
    that includes an addon prefix to another player in the game. This method is typically
    used for communication between players and addon developers or for specific addon-related
    messaging. The message will be sent as a whisper, meaning it will only be visible
    to the receiver and sender, not to other players in the area. The method handles
    the formatting of the message with the prefix and can optionally log the message
    to the player's chat log.
  parameters:
  - name: text
    description: The main text content of the whisper message to be sent
  - name: prefix
    description: The addon prefix that will be added to the beginning of the message
  - name: isLogged
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the message should be logged to
      the player's chat log
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the target player who will receive the whisper message
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Player* receiver = new Player();

      player->WhisperAddon("Hello World!", "[MyAddon]", true, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for addon communication and requires proper
    player pointers to function correctly. The prefix is added to the beginning of
    the message, and the isLogged parameter determines whether the message appears
    in the player's chat log.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method with null pointers or invalid player
    references as it may cause crashes. Ensure that both sender and receiver are valid
    Player objects before calling this method.
