  method: ProcessBotAI
  signature: void BotSessionManager::ProcessBotAI(WorldSession * session, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes AI behavior for bot sessions within the World of Warcraft server.
  description: The ProcessBotAI method is responsible for executing the artificial
    intelligence logic associated with bot characters in the TrinityCore server environment.
    It handles decision-making processes, movement patterns, combat behaviors, and
    other automated actions for bots controlled by the session. This method is typically
    invoked during each game tick to ensure that bot characters respond appropriately
    to their environment and maintain realistic gameplay behavior. The method operates
    on a per-session basis, processing only those bots associated with the provided
    WorldSession object.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the client session
      for which bot AI should be processed. This parameter is required and must point
      to a valid session instance.
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since last call, used to determine
      how much time has passed for AI timing calculations. This value affects movement
      speed, cooldowns, and other time-dependent behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic bot AI processing
    code: "void UpdateBotAI(WorldSession* session, uint32 diff)\n{\n    BotSessionManager::instance()->ProcessBotAI(session,\
      \ diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing multiple sessions
    code: "void UpdateAllBotAIs()\n{\n    for (auto& session : sWorld->GetAllSessions())\n\
      \    {\n        if (session && session->GetPlayer() && session->GetPlayer()->IsBot())\n\
      \        {\n            BotSessionManager::instance()->ProcessBotAI(session,\
      \ sWorld->getMSTimeDiff());\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or tick handler.
    It's important to note that this method may perform significant processing and
    could impact server performance if not properly optimized. The implementation
    likely involves iterating through all active bots within a session and applying
    appropriate AI behaviors based on their current state, target, and environmental
    conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided WorldSession pointer is valid before calling
    this method to avoid segmentation faults. Improper handling of bot AI processing
    can lead to unexpected behavior in bot characters or performance degradation.
    This method should not be called from multiple threads simultaneously without
    proper synchronization.
