  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: IsMoving
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::IsMoving(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified bot player is currently moving.
  description: The IsMoving method checks if a given Player object (typically a bot)
    is currently in motion. This method evaluates the player's movement state by examining
    internal AI flags and movement data to determine if the character is actively
    moving, either through walking, running, or other movement types. It is commonly
    used within the LeaderFollowBehavior class to control follower behavior based
    on whether the leader is moving or stationary. The method does not consider the
    bot's destination or pathfinding state directly, but rather focuses on the active
    movement status of the player object itself.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose movement
      state is being checked. Must be a valid pointer to an existing player instance.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot player is currently moving (walking,
    running, or otherwise in motion), and false if the bot is stationary or not actively
    moving.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if bot is moving
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior->IsMoving(bot)) {\n    // Bot is currently moving\n\
      \    // Perform movement-related actions\n} else {\n    // Bot is stationary\n\
      \    // Perform idle actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsMoving in a follower AI loop
    code: "void FollowerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (!leader || !bot)\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    if (IsMoving(bot)) {\n        // Adjust follower position\
      \ to maintain formation\n        bot->SetFacingTo(leader->GetOrientation());\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Bot is idle, consider repositioning or waiting\n \
      \       if (bot->GetDistance(leader) > FOLLOW_DISTANCE) {\n            bot->GetMotionMaster()->MoveFollow(leader,\
      \ FOLLOW_DISTANCE, 0);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal player movement state tracking within TrinityCore's
    AI system. It may not detect all types of movement immediately due to potential
    latency in state updates. The method should only be called with valid Player pointers
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer passed to this method is valid and points
    to an active player object. Calling this method on a null or invalid pointer will
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. This method does not account for movement
    caused by spells, abilities, or other game mechanics that might temporarily affect
    a player's motion state.
