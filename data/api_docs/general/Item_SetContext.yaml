  class: Item
  method: SetContext
  signature: void Item::SetContext(int context)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the context value for an item, which determines its quality and properties
    in the game world.
  description: The SetContext method assigns a specific context value to an Item object,
    influencing its quality, stats, and other properties within the TrinityCore framework.
    This context value directly affects how the item behaves in-game, including its
    random enchantment, gem sockets, and other configurable attributes. The method
    is typically used during item creation or modification processes to ensure proper
    item configuration according to game mechanics. It should be called before the
    item is fully initialized or added to a player's inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: An integer value representing the context level for the item. This
      value determines the item's quality, stats, and other configurable properties
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetContext(1);

      // Sets item context to 1, affecting item quality and stats'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetContext(3);

      // Sets item context to 3 for higher quality item

      // This would typically be used during item creation or modification'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before the item is added to a player's inventory.
    The context value affects item quality and stats, and it's recommended to set
    this value early in the item creation process. Implementation details may vary
    based on how the item is being created or modified.
  warnings: Improper use of SetContext can lead to items with incorrect quality or
    stats. This method should not be used after an item has been added to a player's
    inventory, as it may cause unexpected behavior or game mechanics issues.
