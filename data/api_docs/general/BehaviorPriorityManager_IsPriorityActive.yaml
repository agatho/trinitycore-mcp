    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified behavior priority is currently active within the
    manager.
  description: The IsPriorityActive method determines if a given BehaviorPriority
    enum value is currently marked as active in the BehaviorPriorityManager. This
    functionality is typically used in AI systems to control which behaviors are currently
    enabled or disabled during runtime. The method performs a simple lookup operation
    against an internal set or list of active priorities and returns true if the specified
    priority exists in that collection, false otherwise. It's commonly called by AI
    decision-making logic to evaluate whether certain actions or behaviors should
    be considered for execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified BehaviorPriority is currently active; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (behaviorManager.IsPriorityActive(BehaviorPriority::Low)) {\n    //\
      \ Execute low priority behavior logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AI Decision Making
    code: "BehaviorPriority currentPriority = BehaviorPriority::Medium;\nif (behaviorManager.IsPriorityActive(currentPriority))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with medium priority AI actions\n    DoMediumPriorityAction();\n\
      } else {\n    // Fall back to default behavior\n    DoDefaultAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in performance-critical AI code paths, so it
    should have O(1) or O(log n) lookup time. The internal implementation likely uses
    a hash set or similar fast lookup structure for active priorities.
  warnings: Ensure that BehaviorPriority values passed to this method are valid and
    defined within the system's priority enum. Passing invalid or uninitialized enum
    values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
