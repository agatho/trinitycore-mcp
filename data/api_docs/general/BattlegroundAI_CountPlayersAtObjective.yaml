  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: CountPlayersAtObjective
  signature: uint32 BattlegroundAI::CountPlayersAtObjective(const int & objLocation,
    float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of players located within a specified range of a given
    objective position in the battleground.
  description: The CountPlayersAtObjective method is used to determine how many players
    are currently positioned within a defined radius around a specific objective location
    on the battleground. This utility function is typically employed by battleground
    AI systems to monitor player proximity to objectives such as flags, capture points,
    or control zones. The method takes an objective location identifier and a range
    value, then iterates through all players in the battleground to check if they
    fall within that range. It returns a count of players meeting this criteria, which
    can be used for decision-making in AI logic, scoring systems, or event triggers.
    The method is const, meaning it does not modify any internal state of the BattlegroundAI
    object.
  parameters:
  - name: objLocation
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific objective location
      within the battleground. This value typically corresponds to predefined constants
      or indices used internally by the battleground system to identify different
      objectives such as flag positions, capture points, or control zones.
  - name: range
    description: A floating-point value specifying the maximum distance (in yards)
      from the objective location within which players are counted. Players must be
      within this range to be included in the returned count.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of players currently located
    within the specified range of the given objective position. If no players are
    found within range, it returns zero.
  examples:
  - title: Count Players Near Flag Position
    code: 'uint32 flagPlayers = bgAI->CountPlayersAtObjective(BG_OBJECTIVE_FLAG_1,
      10.0f);

      // Counts how many players are within 10 yards of flag position 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine Control Zone Occupancy
    code: "uint32 controlPlayers = bgAI->CountPlayersAtObjective(BG_OBJECTIVE_CAPTURE_POINT_2,\
      \ 5.0f);\nif (controlPlayers > 0)\n{\n    // Trigger event if players are present\
      \ in the capture zone\n    bgAI->HandleCapturePointControl(controlPlayers);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through all players in the battleground,
    so performance may be impacted on large battlegrounds with many players. It relies
    on accurate positioning data and assumes that player locations are updated regularly.
    The objLocation parameter must correspond to valid objective identifiers defined
    within the battleground's context.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency update loops as it
    iterates through all players. Ensure that the objLocation value is valid to avoid
    undefined behavior or incorrect results. The range parameter should be carefully
    chosen to match expected gameplay mechanics and not exceed reasonable values for
    performance.
