  class: LFGMgr
  method: SendLfgJoinResult
  signature: void LFGMgr::SendLfgJoinResult(int guid, const LfgJoinResultData & data)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG join result message to the specified player.
  description: The SendLfgJoinResult method is responsible for transmitting the outcome
    of a player's attempt to join a Looking For Group (LFG) dungeon or scenario. It
    sends a structured message containing the result data, including whether the join
    was successful, any errors encountered, and relevant group information. This method
    is typically invoked by the LFG manager when processing player requests to join
    groups, ensuring that players receive immediate feedback about their LFG actions.
    The method operates within the TrinityCore's LFG system and interacts with the
    client-side LFG UI to update player status and group availability.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who initiated the LFG
      join request. This value is used to determine which client should receive the
      result message.
  - name: data
    description: A reference to an LfgJoinResultData structure containing the specific
      details about the join result, such as success status, error codes, and group
      information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendLfgJoinResult
    code: 'LfgJoinResultData resultData;

      resultData.result = LFG_JOIN_RESULT_SUCCESS;

      resultData.groupId = 12345;

      // Assuming we have a player GUID

      SendLfgJoinResult(playerGuid, resultData);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending an error result for LFG join
    code: 'LfgJoinResultData errorData;

      errorData.result = LFG_JOIN_RESULT_ERROR;

      errorData.errorType = LFG_ERROR_GROUP_FULL;

      SendLfgJoinResult(playerGuid, errorData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG subsystem and should only be called
    by other components within the LFG manager. The GUID parameter must correspond
    to an active player session; otherwise, the message will not be delivered. The
    LfgJoinResultData structure contains several fields that are used by the client-side
    UI to display appropriate messages or update group status.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect UI feedback for players
    attempting to join groups. Ensure that all data in the LfgJoinResultData structure
    is properly initialized before calling this method, particularly the result field
    which determines how the client interprets the message.
