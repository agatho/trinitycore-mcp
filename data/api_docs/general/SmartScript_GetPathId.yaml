  class: SmartScript
  method: GetPathId
  signature: uint32 SmartScript::GetPathId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the path identifier associated with the current smart script context.
  description: The GetPathId method returns the unique identifier of the movement
    path that is currently assigned to this SmartScript instance. This identifier
    corresponds to a predefined path in the game's waypoint system, typically used
    for creature movement behaviors such as patroling or following specific routes.
    The returned value can be used to reference or manipulate the associated path
    data within the TrinityCore AI framework. This method is commonly invoked during
    event handling when the script needs to determine or utilize the current path
    configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the identifier of the movement path assigned
    to this SmartScript instance. A value of 0 typically indicates no path is set
    or an invalid path ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Event Handler
    code: "void OnCombatEnter(Unit* who)\n{\n    uint32 pathId = GetPathId();\n  \
      \  if (pathId > 0)\n    {\n        // Start following the assigned path\n  \
      \      me->GetMotionMaster()->MovePath(pathId, false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Path Validation Before Movement
    code: "void OnMovementInform(uint32 type, uint32 id)\n{\n    if (type == POINT_MOTION_TYPE)\n\
      \    {\n        uint32 currentPathId = GetPathId();\n        if (currentPathId\
      \ != 0)\n        {\n            // Continue with path-based movement\n     \
      \       me->GetMotionMaster()->MovePath(currentPathId, false);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement-related SmartAI
    events. The path ID returned should correspond to a valid entry in the `waypoints`
    table within the TrinityCore database. Ensure that the path has been properly
    configured before attempting to use it for creature movement.
  warnings: Using an invalid or uninitialized path ID may result in unexpected behavior
    or errors during creature movement. Always validate the return value before using
    it in movement commands.
