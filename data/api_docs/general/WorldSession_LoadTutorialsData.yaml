documentation:
  brief: Loads tutorial data for the player session from the database.
  description: The LoadTutorialsData method retrieves and initializes tutorial progress
    information for the current player session from the database. This method is typically
    called during player login or session initialization to restore the player's tutorial
    state. It handles loading tutorial bits, which are used to track which tutorials
    the player has completed or viewed. The method processes the database result set
    to populate internal tutorial data structures that control tutorial display and
    progression in the game interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during session initialization
    code: "void WorldSession::HandlePlayerLogin(WorldPacket& /*recvData*/)\n{\n  \
      \  // ... other login logic ...\n    LoadTutorialsData(0); // Load tutorial\
      \ data for the session\n    // ... continue with login process ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player session initialization process and should
    only be called once per session. The method assumes that database connection is
    already established and that the player has a valid session context. Tutorial
    data is stored in the 'character_tutorials' table in the database.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of proper session initialization context
    as it may cause data corruption or inconsistent tutorial states. Ensure that the
    database result parameter is properly handled to avoid memory leaks or invalid
    reads.
