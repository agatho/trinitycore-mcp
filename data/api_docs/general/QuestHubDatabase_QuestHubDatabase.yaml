  brief: Moves a QuestHubDatabase instance to another QuestHubDatabase instance, transferring
    ownership of resources.
  description: This is a move constructor for the QuestHubDatabase class. It transfers
    ownership of resources from the source object (param0) to the newly constructed
    object. This operation typically involves moving internal data structures, database
    connections, or other managed resources without copying them. The source object
    becomes invalid after the move operation and should not be used. In the context
    of TrinityCore's QuestHub system, this constructor is likely used when creating
    new database instances from temporary or existing ones during quest processing
    or data initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move construction of QuestHubDatabase
    code: 'QuestHubDatabase db1;

      // ... initialize db1 ...

      QuestHubDatabase db2 = std::move(db1); // Moves resources from db1 to db2

      // db1 is now in a valid but unspecified state and should not be used'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor follows the C++ move semantics pattern. It's typically used
    in scenarios where you want to avoid expensive copy operations when transferring
    ownership of a QuestHubDatabase object. The moved-from object must not be accessed
    after the operation.
  warnings: After calling this move constructor, the source object is left in a valid
    but unspecified state. Using the source object afterward will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that no other code references the moved-from object.
