api:
  class: SocialEventBus
  method: DeliverEvent
  signature: bool SocialEventBus::DeliverEvent(BotAI * subscriber, const SocialEvent
    & event)
documentation:
  brief: Delivers a social event to a bot AI subscriber.
  description: The DeliverEvent method is responsible for routing and dispatching
    social events to registered bot AI subscribers within the TrinityCore framework.
    It ensures that when a social event occurs, such as a player greeting or interaction,
    the appropriate bot AI instances receive and can respond to the event. This mechanism
    supports dynamic social behavior in the game environment where bots need to react
    to various social stimuli. The method returns true if the event was successfully
    delivered to at least one subscriber, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will receive the social event.
      This parameter must not be null for successful delivery.
  - name: event
    description: The SocialEvent object containing the details of the social interaction.
      This includes information about the type of event, involved players, and any
      associated data needed for processing.
  returns: True if the event was successfully delivered to the subscriber; false if
    delivery failed or no subscribers were available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Delivery
    code: "BotAI* bot = ...;\nSocialEvent event;\nevent.type = SOCIAL_EVENT_GREETING;\n\
      event.playerGuid = 12345;\nbool result = SocialEventBus::DeliverEvent(bot, event);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Event was delivered successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event Delivery with Error Handling
    code: "BotAI* bot = GetBotAI();\nif (!bot) {\n    return false;\n}\nSocialEvent\
      \ event;\nevent.type = SOCIAL_EVENT_CHAT;\nevent.message = \"Hello there!\"\
      ;\nbool delivered = SocialEventBus::DeliverEvent(bot, event);\nif (!delivered)\
      \ {\n    // Handle delivery failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to deliver\
      \ social event to bot AI\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the social interaction system in TrinityCore, enabling
    bots to react dynamically to player actions. It's designed to be efficient and
    thread-safe for use in multi-threaded environments where multiple events may occur
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer passed is valid and not null, otherwise
    the method will likely fail or cause undefined behavior. Also, make sure the SocialEvent
    object contains all necessary data before calling this method.
