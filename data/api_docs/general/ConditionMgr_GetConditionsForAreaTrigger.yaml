  class: ConditionMgr
  method: GetConditionsForAreaTrigger
  signature: const ConditionContainer * ConditionMgr::GetConditionsForAreaTrigger(uint32
    areaTriggerId, bool isServerSide) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the conditions associated with a specific area trigger ID.
  description: The GetConditionsForAreaTrigger method fetches the set of conditions
    that are defined for a given area trigger. This is used in TrinityCore to determine
    whether certain actions or events should be triggered based on player state, quest
    progress, or other game conditions. The method takes an area trigger identifier
    and a flag indicating if the trigger is server-side, returning a pointer to a
    container holding all relevant conditions. If no conditions exist for the specified
    trigger, it returns a null pointer.
  parameters:
  - name: areaTriggerId
    description: The unique identifier of the area trigger for which conditions are
      being retrieved.
  - name: isServerSide
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the area trigger is server-side
      (true) or client-side (false). This affects how conditions are processed and
      applied.
  returns: A pointer to a ConditionContainer containing all conditions associated
    with the specified area trigger. Returns nullptr if no conditions are found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Conditions for an Area Trigger
    code: "const ConditionContainer* conditions = sConditionMgr->GetConditionsForAreaTrigger(12345,\
      \ true);\nif (conditions)\n{\n    // Process the conditions\n    for (auto&\
      \ condition : *conditions)\n    {\n        // Handle each condition\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during area trigger activation logic to evaluate
    whether the player meets all necessary criteria before proceeding with an action.
    The returned ConditionContainer should not be modified directly as it's managed
    by the ConditionMgr singleton.
  warnings: Ensure that the areaTriggerId passed is valid and corresponds to an actual
    area trigger in the database, otherwise the method will return nullptr. Also,
    be cautious about using the result without checking for null before dereferencing.
