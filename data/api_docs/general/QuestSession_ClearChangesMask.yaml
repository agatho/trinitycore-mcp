documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the quest session, resetting all tracked modifications.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a QuestSession object. This operation typically clears any pending or tracked
    modifications to quest data within the session, ensuring that subsequent operations
    start with a clean state. In the context of TrinityCore's quest system, this may
    be used to reset modification flags after saving or applying changes, preventing
    redundant updates or duplicate processing. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations. It is commonly invoked during quest completion,
    reset, or synchronization processes where the session needs to be cleared of pending
    changes.

    code: "QuestSession* session = player->GetQuestSession();\nif (session)\n{\n \
      \   session->ClearChangesMask();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the quest system when changes
    are successfully applied or saved. It's important to understand that clearing
    the mask does not undo any actual quest progress or state changes; it only resets
    tracking flags for future operations.
