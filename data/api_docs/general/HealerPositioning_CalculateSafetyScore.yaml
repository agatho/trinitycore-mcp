  brief: Calculates a safety score for a healer based on position and threat levels
  description: The CalculateSafetyScore method evaluates the relative safety of a
    healer's current position within a combat scenario by analyzing both their physical
    location and the level of threat from nearby enemies. This score is used to determine
    optimal positioning for healing, helping the AI decide whether a healer should
    remain in place or move to a safer location. The method takes into account factors
    such as proximity to hostile targets, potential damage exposure, and overall battlefield
    positioning to compute a numerical safety value that can be compared against other
    possible positions.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer representing the healer's current position index or coordinate
      within the combat area. This typically corresponds to a specific location in
      a grid-based system or spatial mapping of the battlefield.
  - name: threats
    description: An integer indicating the total threat level from nearby hostile
      targets. This value usually represents aggregated damage potential or danger
      metrics from enemies that could affect the healer's safety.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated safety score for the healer's
    current position. Higher scores indicate safer positions, while lower scores suggest
    increased risk. The exact range and interpretation of this value depends on internal
    weighting systems but generally follows a normalized scale where values closer
    to 1.0 represent maximum safety.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float safety = healerPositioning.CalculateSafetyScore(5, 3); // Position\
      \ 5 with moderate threat level\nif (safety > 0.7f) {\n    // Proceed with current\
      \ position\n} else {\n    // Consider moving to a safer location\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing multiple positions
    code: "int bestPosition = 0;\nfloat highestScore = -1.0f;\nfor (int i = 0; i <\
      \ totalPositions; ++i) {\n    float score = healerPositioning.CalculateSafetyScore(i,\
      \ threatLevel);\n    if (score > highestScore) {\n        highestScore = score;\n\
      \        bestPosition = i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestPosition for optimal healer\
      \ placement"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI decision-making framework that
    evaluates combat positioning. The calculation may involve complex spatial algorithms
    or heuristics to weigh positional safety against threat levels. Performance-wise,
    this function should be lightweight enough for frequent calls during active combat
    scenarios.
  warnings: The exact implementation details are not provided, so assumptions about
    how 'pos' and 'threats' are interpreted should be validated in context. Using
    raw position indices without proper bounds checking may lead to undefined behavior
    if values exceed expected ranges.
