documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a trade between two players is considered safe based on
    game rules and player conditions.
  description: The IsTradeSafe method evaluates if a trade between two players in
    World of Warcraft is allowed under the current game context. It checks various
    conditions such as player proximity, PvP status, faction alignment, and other
    relevant game mechanics to ensure that trading does not violate server rules or
    game balance. This method is typically called during trade operations to validate
    whether both parties can safely engage in a trade transaction without triggering
    restrictions or penalties.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trade between the players is considered safe according
    to game rules and conditions; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Safety Check
    code: "if (tradeManager.IsTradeSafe()) {\n    // Proceed with trade logic\n  \
      \  player1->SendTradeUpdate();\n    player2->SendTradeUpdate();\n} else {\n\
      \    // Prevent trade and notify players\n    player1->SendTradeStatus(TRADE_STATUS_INVALID_TRADE);\n\
      \    player2->SendTradeStatus(TRADE_STATUS_INVALID_TRADE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve checks against player distance, PvP flags, faction
    status, and other contextual factors. It's important to note that even if a trade
    is marked as safe, additional validation might occur during the actual trade process.
