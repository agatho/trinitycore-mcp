  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: UpdateModelWeights
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::UpdateModelWeights(uint32 itemId, float error)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the model weights for a specific item based on the provided error
    value.
  description: The UpdateModelWeights method adjusts the internal machine learning
    model weights associated with a given item ID using the supplied error value.
    This function is typically used in market analysis systems to refine predictions
    or classifications related to item pricing, demand forecasting, or inventory management
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method modifies the model's internal state
    and does not return any value. It is expected that this method is called during
    regular game updates or when new market data becomes available to maintain accurate
    predictive models.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which model weights need to
      be updated. This should correspond to a valid item in the game's database.
  - name: error
    description: The error value used to adjust the model weights. This typically
      represents the difference between predicted and actual market values, guiding
      the learning process of the model.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      uint32 itemId = 12345;

      float error = 0.05f;

      analysis.UpdateModelWeights(itemId, error);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Market Data Processing Loop
    code: "for (auto& item : marketItems)\n{\n    float predictedPrice = GetPredictedPrice(item.id);\n\
      \    float actualPrice = GetActualPrice(item.id);\n    float error = predictedPrice\
      \ - actualPrice;\n    analysis.UpdateModelWeights(item.id, error);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger market analysis system that uses machine
    learning to predict item values. The model weights are probably stored in memory
    and may be persisted to database periodically. Ensure that itemId refers to a
    valid item in the game's database to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid itemId values may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Make sure that error values are within reasonable bounds to prevent
    model instability. This function should not be called concurrently from multiple
    threads without proper synchronization.
