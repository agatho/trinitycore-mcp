documentation:
  brief: Returns the trait configuration data for the specified config ID
  description: The GetTraitConfig method retrieves the trait configuration data associated
    with a specific config ID from the player's trait system. This method is used
    to access trait configurations that define how traits are applied and managed
    within the player's character. The returned pointer provides access to trait configuration
    data which may include various trait-related information such as trait points,
    unlock requirements, or other configuration parameters. The method operates on
    a per-config basis, allowing players to retrieve specific trait configurations
    based on their current trait setup.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const int pointer that represents the trait configuration data
    for the specified config ID. If no valid configuration exists for the given configId,
    the method returns nullptr. The returned pointer points to an array of integers
    representing trait configuration values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trait Config Retrieval
    code: "const int* traitConfig = player->GetTraitConfig(12345);\nif (traitConfig\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process trait configuration data\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Trait config value: \" << *traitConfig << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with trait system operations
    and requires proper handling of trait configurations. The method may return nullptr
    if no valid configuration exists for the specified config ID, so developers should
    always check for null before dereferencing the returned pointer.
  warnings: Care must be taken when accessing trait configurations as they may not
    exist for all config IDs. Incorrectly accessing non-existent configurations can
    lead to memory access violations or undefined behavior. The method is thread-safe
    and does not require exclusive access to player data.
