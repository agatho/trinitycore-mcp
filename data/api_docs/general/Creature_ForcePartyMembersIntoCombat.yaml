documentation:
  brief: Force party members into combat with the creature's current target.
  description: This method ensures that all party members of the creature are pulled
    into combat with the creature's current target. It is typically used in scenarios
    where a creature needs to maintain group engagement or when the creature's behavior
    requires all party members to be involved in combat. The method effectively forces
    the creature's party members to attack the creature's current target, regardless
    of their individual state or location.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->ForcePartyMembersIntoCombat();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the creature has a valid target and
    party members. It does not change the creature's own combat state, but rather
    forces party members into combat with the creature's current target.
  warnings: This method may cause unexpected behavior if used in scenarios where party
    members are already engaged in combat or if the creature's target is not properly
    set. Use carefully to avoid unintended consequences.
