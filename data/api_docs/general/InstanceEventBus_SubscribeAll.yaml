  class: InstanceEventBus
  method: SubscribeAll
  signature: void InstanceEventBus::SubscribeAll(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all available instance events within the EventBus
    system.
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a given BotAI subscriber with the
    InstanceEventBus, enabling it to receive notifications for all instance-related
    events. This is typically used during bot initialization or when transitioning
    between different instance states. The method ensures that the subscriber will
    be notified of any event dispatched through the bus without requiring individual
    subscription calls for each event type. It's important to note that this subscription
    applies to all future events and does not retroactively notify the subscriber
    of previously dispatched events.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will be subscribed to all instance
      events. Must be a valid, initialized BotAI object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Subscription of a BotAI
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();

      InstanceEventBus::instance()->SubscribeAll(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Subscribing Multiple Bots to Instance Events
    code: 'BotAI* bot1 = new BotAI();

      BotAI* bot2 = new BotAI();

      InstanceEventBus::instance()->SubscribeAll(bot1);

      InstanceEventBus::instance()->SubscribeAll(bot2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during the initialization phase
    of a BotAI instance. The subscription is persistent until explicitly removed via
    an unsubscribe mechanism (not shown in this signature). It's recommended to verify
    that the BotAI pointer is valid before calling SubscribeAll to avoid potential
    crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling SubscribeAll on an already subscribed BotAI may lead to duplicate
    event notifications or unexpected behavior. Ensure proper cleanup and unsubscription
    when a BotAI instance is destroyed or no longer needed. This method does not perform
    any validation on the subscriber parameter, so passing a null pointer will likely
    cause runtime errors.
