  class: ResourceInfo
  method: ResourceInfo
  signature: void ResourceInfo::ResourceInfo(ResourceType t, uint32 cur, uint32 max,
    float regen)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ResourceInfo object with specified resource type, current value,
    maximum value, and regeneration rate.
  description: The ResourceInfo constructor initializes a resource information structure
    with the provided parameters. This method sets up the fundamental properties of
    a game resource such as health, mana, energy, or rage. The resource type determines
    how the resource behaves in the game system, while current and maximum values
    define the resource's state. The regeneration rate controls how quickly the resource
    replenishes over time. This constructor is typically used when creating or updating
    resource information for player characters, NPCs, or game objects within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The ResourceType enumeration value that specifies the type of resource
      being initialized (e.g., HEALTH, MANA, ENERGY). This determines how the resource
      is managed and displayed in the game.
  - name: cur
    description: The current value of the resource. Must be a non-negative integer
      that does not exceed the maximum value specified.
  - name: max
    description: The maximum value of the resource. Defines the upper bound for the
      resource and must be greater than or equal to the current value.
  - name: regen
    description: The regeneration rate of the resource per second. Can be zero or
      positive, representing how quickly the resource replenishes over time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Player Mana Resource
    code: 'ResourceInfo mana(ResourceType::MANA, 500, 1000, 2.5f);

      // Creates a mana resource with current value 500, max 1000, regen rate 2.5
      per second'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize Player Health Resource
    code: 'ResourceInfo health(ResourceType::HEALTH, 1500, 2000, 0.0f);

      // Creates a health resource with current value 1500, max 2000, no regeneration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when managing character resources. The resource type must be valid according to
    the ResourceType enum defined in the codebase. It's important to ensure that current
    values do not exceed maximum values, as this may cause unexpected behavior in
    resource management systems.
  warnings: Passing negative values for current or max parameters may lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that regen rates are non-negative unless specifically required
    to be negative for special effects. The constructor does not validate that the
    resource type is supported by the game system, so invalid types may cause runtime
    errors.
