api:
  class: Player
  method: Say
  signature: void Player::Say(uint32 textId, const int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Player says a message using a text ID, which is typically used for emotes
    or chat messages in World of Warcraft.
  description: The Say method allows a player to send a message to nearby players
    using a predefined text ID. This method is commonly used for emotes or chat messages
    where the text ID corresponds to a specific message in the game's database. The
    method does not return any value and typically requires the player to be within
    range of other players for the message to be visible. It is often used in conjunction
    with other methods like Player::Yell or Player::Shout to control communication
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: textId
    description: The identifier of the text message to be sent. This corresponds to
      a specific entry in the game's database and typically represents a predefined
      message or emote that can be displayed to other players.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target player or nullptr if no specific target is
      required. This parameter allows for targeted communication, where the message
      is sent only to the specified player rather than all nearby players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->Say(12345, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Targeted message example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Player* target = new Player();

      player->Say(12345, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other communication methods
    and requires the player to be within range of other players for the message to
    be visible. Implementation details include handling of text ID validation and
    ensuring proper targeting.
  warnings: This method should not be used for general chat messages unless specifically
    intended for emotes or predefined text IDs. Improper use may result in no visible
    message to other players.
