  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: Instance
  signature: AIDecisionProfiler & AIDecisionProfiler::Instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AIDecisionProfiler class for managing
    AI decision profiling data.
  description: The Instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the AIDecisionProfiler
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the profiler exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access global AI decision profiling
    functionality, such as logging performance metrics or tracking decision-making
    processes of AI-controlled entities in the game world. The returned reference
    provides access to all profiling capabilities without requiring explicit instantiation.
    This design allows for centralized management of AI performance data across different
    subsystems while maintaining thread safety through proper synchronization mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single global instance of the AIDecisionProfiler class,
    enabling direct access to its profiling methods and data members.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing AI Profiler Instance
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler& profiler = AIDecisionProfiler::Instance();

      profiler.StartProfiling("EnemyTargetSelection");

      // ... AI decision logic ...

      profiler.StopProfiling();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Profiler for Performance Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorAIProcess() {\n    auto& profiler = AIDecisionProfiler::Instance();\n\
      \    profiler.BeginTiming(\"NPCDecisionCycle\");\n    // AI decision making\
      \ logic here\n    profiler.EndTiming();\n    profiler.LogReport();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and designed to be called from any context within
    the TrinityCore framework. The singleton instance is initialized on first access
    and persists for the lifetime of the application, making it suitable for continuous
    profiling operations during server runtime.
