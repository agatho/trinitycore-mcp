  signature: bool SupportMgr::GetTicketSystemStatus() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the ticket system is enabled or disabled in the TrinityCore
    server configuration.
  description: The GetTicketSystemStatus method retrieves the current operational
    status of the ticket system within the TrinityCore server. This system allows
    players to submit support tickets for issues they encounter while playing. The
    method returns a boolean value indicating if the ticket system is active (true)
    or inactive (false). This check is typically used before attempting to create
    or retrieve tickets, ensuring that the feature is properly configured and available
    for use. The status is determined by server configuration settings and does not
    depend on runtime conditions such as player login state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ticket system is enabled in the server configuration;
    returns false if it is disabled. A return value of false indicates that players
    cannot submit or view support tickets through the standard interface.
  examples:
  - title: Check Ticket System Status Before Creating a Ticket
    code: "if (sSupportMgr->GetTicketSystemStatus()) {\n    // Proceed with ticket\
      \ creation logic\n    sTicketMgr->CreateTicket(playerGuid, \"Player needs help\
      \ with quest.\");\n} else {\n    // Inform player that tickets are not currently\
      \ accepted\n    player->SendNotification(\"Ticket system is currently disabled.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple configuration check and does not involve database
    queries or network calls, making it lightweight to execute. The status of the
    ticket system is typically set via server configuration files during startup and
    remains static throughout runtime unless manually changed.
  warnings: Ensure that the ticket system is properly configured in the server's configuration
    file before relying on this method. If the system is disabled but code attempts
    to create tickets anyway, it may lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior.
