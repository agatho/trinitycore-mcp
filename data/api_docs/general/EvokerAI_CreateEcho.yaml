  class: EvokerAI
  method: CreateEcho
  signature: void EvokerAI::CreateEcho(int * target, int healAmount, int numHeals)
documentation:
  brief: Creates an echo effect that heals a target multiple times with specified
    heal amount.
  description: The CreateEcho method generates an evoker's echo ability which applies
    healing effects to a target. This method is used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    Evoker class AI behavior, specifically for managing the Echo spell mechanics.
    The method takes a pointer to a target unit, a heal amount value, and the number
    of heals to apply. It functions as part of the evoker's combat strategy, allowing
    the AI to simulate the echo ability's healing over time effect on a specified
    target.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that will receive the echo healing effects.
      Must point to a valid GameObject or Unit object.
  - name: healAmount
    description: The amount of healing to be applied with each individual heal effect
      from the echo ability.
  - name: numHeals
    description: The total number of heal effects to apply to the target, determining
      how many times the healAmount will be applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Echo Creation
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      int healAmount = 500;

      int numHeals = 3;

      me->GetAI()->CreateEcho(&target, healAmount, numHeals);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Echo with Dynamic Values
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();

      int healAmount = CalculateHealAmount();

      int numHeals = 2 + urand(0, 2);

      me->GetAI()->CreateEcho(&target, healAmount, numHeals);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the EvokerAI's combat decision-making
    logic. The target parameter should be validated before calling to ensure it points
    to a valid unit or game object. The healing effects are applied sequentially and
    may be subject to spell power scaling based on the evoker's current stats.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is not null or invalid before passing it
    to this method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause undefined behavior.
    The healAmount and numHeals parameters should be validated to prevent overflow
    or negative values that could lead to unexpected healing behavior.
