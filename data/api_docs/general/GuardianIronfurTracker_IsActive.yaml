  signature: bool GuardianIronfurTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the Ironfur guardian ability is currently active on the target.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the Ironfur guardian ability, which
    provides damage reduction and other protective effects, is currently active on
    the target unit. This method is typically used in AI logic to make decisions based
    on the current state of the guardian's protective abilities. The check considers
    all relevant conditions that would cause the ability to be active or inactive,
    such as duration timers, buff states, or external factors that might remove the
    effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Ironfur guardian ability is currently active on the
    target; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (guardian->GetIronfurTracker()->IsActive())\n{\n    // Perform action\
      \ only when Ironfur is active\n    attacker->AddThreat(target, 100.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking activation status before applying new effects
    code: "if (!guardian->GetIronfurTracker()->IsActive())\n{\n    // Apply Ironfur\
      \ if not already active\n    guardian->CastSpell(target, IRONFUR_SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and should be efficient to call.
    It is recommended to cache the result if the same value will be needed multiple
    times within a single AI cycle.
