documentation:
  brief: Returns the initial mana value that was set during unit creation
  description: The GetCreateMana method retrieves the base mana amount that was originally
    assigned to a Unit when it was created. This value represents the unit's starting
    mana pool before any modifications from buffs, debuffs, spells, or other game
    mechanics have been applied. For player characters, this typically corresponds
    to their base mana as determined by their class and level at creation. For NPCs,
    this value is usually set based on their entry in the creature_template table.
    This method is commonly used in scenarios where the original mana value needs
    to be referenced, such as calculating percentage-based mana regeneration or restoring
    a unit's mana to its initial state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unit's initial mana pool. This value is
    typically the base mana amount that was set during creation and does not include
    any temporary modifications from spells, effects, or buffs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Get Base Mana
    code: 'Unit* target = ...; // some unit

      uint32 baseMana = target->GetCreateMana();

      // Use baseMana for calculations or comparisons'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Current and Base Mana
    code: 'Unit* player = ...;

      uint32 currentMana = player->GetPower(POWER_MANA);

      uint32 baseMana = player->GetCreateMana();

      float manaPercentage = (float)currentMana / (float)baseMana * 100.0f;

      // Calculate what percentage of base mana the player currently has'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the value set during unit creation and does not reflect
    any changes made to the unit's mana pool through gameplay mechanics. The returned
    value is typically stored in the unit's internal data structure and should be
    consistent across all instances of that unit type. This method is safe to call
    from any thread context where the Unit pointer is valid.
  warnings: Be aware that this value represents only the base mana amount, not the
    current effective mana. If you need the actual current mana value for calculations,
    use GetPower(POWER_MANA) instead. Also, ensure that the Unit pointer is valid
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
