  signature: bool Player::IsResurrectRequestedBy(const int & guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has been requested for resurrection by another player.
  description: This method determines whether the current player has received a resurrection
    request from another player, typically used in the context of battlegrounds or
    arena matches where players can resurrect their allies. It checks the state of
    the player's resurrection request status and returns true if a resurrection request
    exists, false otherwise. The method is commonly used to prevent players from being
    resurrected multiple times during combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The GUID of the player who requested the resurrection. This parameter
      represents the unique identifier of the requesting player in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the current player has been requested for resurrection
    by the specified player, false otherwise. The method may return false if no resurrection
    request exists or if the player is not in a valid state for resurrection.
  examples:
  - title: Checking resurrection request status
    code: "if (player->IsResurrectRequestedBy(12345)) {\n    // Player has been requested\
      \ for resurrection\n    // Handle accordingly\n}\nelse {\n    // No resurrection\
      \ request exists\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resurrection-related
    methods to manage player state during combat. It requires that the player be in
    a valid state for resurrection (e.g., not in combat or not dead). Performance
    considerations include checking against a player's GUID rather than using direct
    references.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state
    for resurrection, such as during battlegrounds or arena matches. Calling this
    method outside of these contexts may result in incorrect behavior or errors.
