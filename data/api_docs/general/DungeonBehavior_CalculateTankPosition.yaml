  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: CalculateTankPosition
  signature: int DungeonBehavior::CalculateTankPosition(const DungeonEncounter & encounter,
    const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal tank position within a dungeon encounter
    based on enemy configuration.
  description: The CalculateTankPosition method determines the most effective positioning
    strategy for a tank character during a dungeon encounter. It evaluates the current
    state of enemies and their arrangement to compute an appropriate tank placement
    that maximizes threat generation and minimizes risk. This method is typically
    used in AI-driven behavior systems where optimal positioning is crucial for successful
    encounter completion. The calculation considers factors such as enemy proximity,
    threat distribution, and positional advantages within the dungeon environment.
  parameters:
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the current dungeon encounter object containing encounter
      state information including enemy positions and health data
  - name: enemies
    description: Integer value representing the number of active enemies in the current
      encounter, used to determine positioning strategy
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal tank position
    index. The value typically corresponds to a predefined position within the encounter
    area, with negative values indicating invalid or undefined positions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "DungeonEncounter currentEncounter;\nint enemyCount = 5;\nint tankPosition\
      \ = dungeonBehavior.CalculateTankPosition(currentEncounter, enemyCount);\nif\
      \ (tankPosition >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with tank positioning\n    printf(\"\
      Optimal tank position: %d\\n\", tankPosition);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ position case\n    printf(\"Invalid tank position calculated\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "DungeonEncounter currentEncounter;\nint enemyCount = encounter.GetActiveEnemies();\n\
      int tankPosition = dungeonBehavior.CalculateTankPosition(currentEncounter, enemyCount);\n\
      \nswitch (tankPosition) {\n    case 0:\n        // Position at front center\n\
      \        break;\n    case 1:\n        // Position at left flank\n        break;\n\
      \    case 2:\n        // Position at right flank\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Handle error or fallback position\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the dungeon encounter AI system and should only be
    called during active encounters. The calculation may vary based on dungeon difficulty
    settings and player class configurations. Performance is optimized for real-time
    calculations during combat, but complex encounters might require additional processing
    time.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active dungeon encounter may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect positioning calculations. Ensure that the encounter
    parameter contains valid data before calling to avoid runtime errors.
