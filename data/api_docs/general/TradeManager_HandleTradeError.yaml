documentation:
  brief: Handles and processes trade errors by logging the error message and notifying
    the involved players.
  description: The HandleTradeError method is responsible for managing trade-related
    errors within the TrinityCore framework. It accepts an error message string and
    performs necessary actions to communicate the issue to the players involved in
    the trade. This typically involves sending error messages to the client interfaces
    of both parties, logging the event for debugging purposes, and potentially resetting
    the trade state. The method ensures that trade operations can gracefully handle
    failures without crashing the game server or leaving players in an inconsistent
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: error
    description: A string containing the error message describing what went wrong
      during the trade operation. This should be a human-readable description of the
      failure condition.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Error Handling
    code: TradeManager::HandleTradeError("Trade canceled due to invalid item.");
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Insufficient Funds Error
    code: TradeManager::HandleTradeError("Insufficient gold to complete the trade.");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the trade system when validation
    checks fail or when an unexpected condition occurs during a trade negotiation.
    It's important that error messages are clear and concise to help players understand
    what went wrong.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in inconsistent trade states or
    failure to notify players about errors, leading to a poor user experience. Ensure
    all error conditions are properly handled before calling this method.
