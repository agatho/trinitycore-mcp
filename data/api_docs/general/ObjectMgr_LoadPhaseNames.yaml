  method: LoadPhaseNames
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadPhaseNames()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes phase names from the database into memory for use in
    World of Warcraft phase system.
  description: The LoadPhaseNames method retrieves all defined phase names from the
    database table 'phase_names' and stores them in an internal lookup structure within
    the ObjectMgr class. This allows the game server to efficiently reference phase
    names by their numeric IDs during gameplay, enabling features like phase-based
    questing, world events, and instance zoning. The method is typically called during
    server startup or database reload operations to ensure all phase data is available
    for active game objects and players. It performs validation on loaded data and
    handles potential duplicate entries gracefully.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadPhaseNames();\n\
      \    // Phase names are now available for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's initialization sequence and should
    only be called once during server startup. The loaded phase names are stored in
    a map structure for O(1) lookup performance. This method does not handle concurrent
    access, so it should be called from a single-threaded context.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate entries or
    memory leaks if not properly managed. It assumes the database connection is already
    established and that the 'phase_names' table exists with proper schema. Do not
    call this method while active game sessions are running as it could cause race
    conditions.
