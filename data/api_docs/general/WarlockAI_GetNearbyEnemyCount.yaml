  class: WarlockAI
  method: GetNearbyEnemyCount
  signature: uint32 WarlockAI::GetNearbyEnemyCount(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of nearby enemy units within a specified range for the
    warlock AI.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemyCount method calculates and returns the total number
    of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within the defined range around
    the warlock's AI-controlled unit. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    logic to determine enemy density, which can influence spell selection, movement
    patterns, or tactical behavior. The range parameter defines the maximum distance
    from the warlock's position where enemies are considered 'nearby'. This function
    performs a spatial query against the current game world entities and filters them
    based on their faction and visibility status. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with other AI methods to implement adaptive combat strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) from the warlock's position to consider
      enemies as nearby. Must be a positive value greater than zero.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the count of enemy units found within the
    specified range. Returns 0 if no enemies are detected or if the range is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine enemy density
    code: "uint32 enemyCount = warlockAI->GetNearbyEnemyCount(10.0f);\nif (enemyCount\
      \ > 3)\n{\n    // Execute area-of-effect spell\n    warlockAI->DoCast(SPELL_SHADOW_BOLT_VOLLEY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using enemy count for tactical decision making
    code: "float range = 15.0f;\nuint32 nearbyEnemies = warlockAI->GetNearbyEnemyCount(range);\n\
      if (nearbyEnemies >= 2)\n{\n    // Switch to more defensive behavior\n    warlockAI->SetReactState(REACT_DEFENSIVE);\n\
      }\nelse if (nearbyEnemies == 0)\n{\n    // Move towards enemies or reposition\n\
      \    warlockAI->DoMoveTo(enemyTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial query using the game's internal entity management
    system. It may have performance implications when called frequently in tight loops,
    especially with large range values. The method considers only visible enemies
    and respects faction-based hostility rules. Results are cached internally for
    efficiency during single AI update cycles.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very large range value can cause performance
    degradation due to extensive entity scanning. Avoid calling it in high-frequency
    loops without caching results. Ensure that the warlock unit is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as it relies on valid position data.
