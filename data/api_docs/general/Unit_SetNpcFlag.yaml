documentation:
  brief: Sets the NPC flags for a unit, determining its interaction behavior with
    players.
  description: This method configures the NPCFlags value for a Unit object, which
    controls how the unit interacts with player characters in the game world. The
    NPCFlags determines whether the unit is considered a vendor, trainer, quest-giver,
    or other type of NPC. This setting affects the unit's behavior in terms of dialog
    options, trading capabilities, and quest acceptance. The method directly modifies
    the internal NPC flag state without requiring additional checks or validation.
