  signature: void Item::SetSlot(uint8 slot)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the slot position of the item to the specified value.
  description: The SetSlot method assigns a specific slot position to an Item object,
    determining where in the player's inventory or equipment the item will be placed.
    This method is commonly used during item creation or when modifying item properties
    during gameplay. The slot parameter represents the inventory slot index, which
    can range from 0 to 119 for inventory slots or 128 to 135 for equipment slots.
    The method updates internal data structures to reflect the new slot position,
    ensuring proper handling of item placement within the game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The slot position to assign to the item. Valid values are integers
      from 0 to 119 for inventory slots or 128 to 135 for equipment slots. This parameter
      determines where in the player's inventory or equipment the item will be placed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetSlot(10);

      // Sets item to slot position 10 in inventory'
    language: cpp
  - title: Equipment slot example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetSlot(130);

      // Sets item to equipment slot 130 ( chest slot)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the item's internal slot data structure. It
    should be used carefully during item creation or modification, as improper usage
    can lead to incorrect item placement in inventory or equipment slots. The method
    does not validate whether the slot is already occupied by another item.
  warnings: Using this method without proper validation may result in items being
    placed in invalid slots, causing game crashes or unexpected behavior. Care should
    be taken when setting slots for items that are already equipped or in use.
