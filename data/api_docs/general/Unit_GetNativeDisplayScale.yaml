  signature: float Unit::GetNativeDisplayScale() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the native display scale of the unit.
  description: The GetNativeDisplayScale method retrieves the scale factor that represents
    the native display size of the unit in the game world. This value is typically
    used to determine how the unit should be rendered visually, particularly for creatures
    or players with specific model scales. The method is commonly used in conjunction
    with other display-related functions to ensure proper visual representation and
    positioning within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the native display scale of the unit,
    typically ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 indicates normal scale and values
    less than 1.0 indicate smaller scale.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float scale = unit->GetNativeDisplayScale();\n// Use scale for visual calculations\n\
      if (scale > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Apply scale to model rendering\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and should be used carefully when dealing
    with visual scaling in game mechanics. It may return different values depending
    on whether the unit is a player or creature, and can affect how models are rendered
    in the game world.
