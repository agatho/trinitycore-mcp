documentation:
  brief: Applies buffs to the warrior bot based on current combat state and available
    abilities.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for determining and applying appropriate
    buffs to a warrior AI bot. This method evaluates the current combat situation,
    checks for available buff spells, and applies them to enhance the bot's performance.
    It typically considers factors such as health status, mana levels, and proximity
    to enemies or allies. The method ensures that the bot maintains optimal conditions
    for engaging in combat by applying buffs like Battle Shout, Bloodrage, or other
    relevant warrior abilities based on predefined logic and game state conditions.

  notes: This method is typically called during the AI decision-making cycle and may
    have dependencies on other internal state management functions. It's designed
    to be non-blocking and should not cause significant performance impact when executed
    regularly.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid warrior character before
    calling this method, as invalid references could lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes within the AI system.
