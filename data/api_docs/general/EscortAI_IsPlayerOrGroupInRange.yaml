  class: EscortAI
  method: IsPlayerOrGroupInRange
  signature: bool EscortAI::IsPlayerOrGroupInRange()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player or their group is within the specified range of the
    escort AI.
  description: The IsPlayerOrGroupInRange method determines whether the player controlled
    by this EscortAI instance, or the player's group if they are in one, is currently
    within a defined distance threshold. This functionality is crucial for escort
    quests where the AI needs to know when the player has approached or moved away
    from important waypoints or objectives. The method typically evaluates the distance
    between the AI's current position and the player's position, considering group
    members as well if applicable. It returns true if the player or their group is
    within range, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player or their group is within the defined range of
    the escort AI; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in an escort AI event handler
    code: "void EscortAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (IsPlayerOrGroupInRange())\n\
      \    {\n        // Player is close enough to trigger an event\n        DoScriptText(SAY_START,\
      \ me);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal distance calculations and may consider the
    AI's current waypoint or target position when determining range. It's commonly
    used in conjunction with other EscortAI methods to manage quest progression based
    on player proximity.
