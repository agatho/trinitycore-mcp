  method: GetChannelName
  signature: void Channel::GetChannelName(std::string & channelName, uint32 channelId,
    LocaleConstant locale, const AreaTableEntry * zoneEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the localized name of a channel based on its ID and locale.
  description: The GetChannelName method fetches the human-readable name of a specific
    chat channel using its unique identifier, locale setting, and optional zone information.
    This function is typically used to display channel names in the user interface
    or when processing chat messages. The method populates the provided string reference
    with the appropriate localized channel name, taking into account the specified
    locale and, if available, the area zone entry for context-aware naming. It does
    not return a value directly but modifies the input string parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: channelName
    description: Reference to a std::string that will be populated with the localized
      channel name.
  - name: channelId
    description: Unique identifier for the channel, used to look up the appropriate
      channel definition in the game's internal database.
  - name: locale
    description: LocaleConstant value indicating the language and region settings
      for localization of the channel name.
  - name: zoneEntry
    description: Pointer to an AreaTableEntry structure representing the current zone,
      used for zone-specific channel naming where applicable.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::string channelName;

      Channel::GetChannelName(channelName, 5, LOCALE_en, nullptr);

      // channelName now contains the English name of channel ID 5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Zone Context
    code: 'AreaTableEntry const* zone = sAreaTableStore.LookupEntry(1234); // Example
      zone ID

      std::string channelName;

      Channel::GetChannelName(channelName, 7, LOCALE_fr, zone);

      // channelName now contains the French name of channel ID 7 for zone 1234'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal game data structures and localization tables.
    The zoneEntry parameter may be null, in which case only generic channel naming
    is applied. Ensure that the channelId corresponds to a valid existing channel;
    otherwise, behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Do not pass invalid or uninitialized LocaleConstant values as the locale
    parameter, as this can lead to incorrect or missing localization. Also, ensure
    that zoneEntry points to a valid AreaTableEntry or is null, otherwise memory access
    violations may occur.
