  class: MoveSpline
  method: getPath
  signature: const int & MoveSpline::getPath() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the path index associated with the movement spline.
  description: The getPath method returns the current path index that the MoveSpline
    object is referencing. This index typically corresponds to a specific path segment
    or waypoint within the spline's movement definition. The returned value represents
    an internal identifier used by the TrinityCore movement system to track which
    portion of a multi-segment path is currently being traversed. This method is commonly
    used in conjunction with movement-related systems such as creature AI, player
    movement, and object positioning.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the current path index.
    The value typically indicates the segment or waypoint number within the spline's
    path definition, starting from zero or one depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MoveSpline* spline = player->GetMoveSpline();\nconst int& pathIndex = spline->getPath();\n\
      if (pathIndex >= 0) {\n    // Process current path segment\n    printf(\"Currently\
      \ on path segment: %d\\n\", pathIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference to an internal integer member variable,
    so modifications to the returned value will not affect the original spline's path
    index. The path index is typically updated during movement execution and may change
    as the spline progresses through its defined waypoints.
