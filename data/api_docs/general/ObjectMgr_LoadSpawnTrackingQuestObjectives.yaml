documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spawn tracking quest objectives from the database.
  description: The LoadSpawnTrackingQuestObjectives method is responsible for loading
    quest objective data related to tracked spawns from the database into memory.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining accurate quest progress tracking
    when players interact with specific game objects or creatures that are part of
    a quest's requirements. The method typically runs during server startup or database
    reload operations to ensure all spawn tracking data is available for active quests.
    It processes entries in the database that define which objects should be tracked
    for quest completion purposes, such as killing specific creatures or interacting
    with certain GameObjects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadSpawnTrackingQuestObjectives();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    processes. It's important to note that this method does not validate the existence
    of tracked objects in the world; it only loads the tracking configuration from
    the database. The actual tracking logic for these objectives is handled separately
    by other systems.
  warnings: Improper execution of this method can lead to incomplete quest tracking
    or missing spawn tracking data, potentially causing quests to not progress correctly
    for players. This method should only be called after the database connection is
    fully established and ready for queries.
