  class: WorldObject
  method: IsAlwaysVisibleFor
  signature: bool WorldObject::IsAlwaysVisibleFor(const WorldObject * seer) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is always visible to a specific observer.
  description: This method checks if a WorldObject is always visible to a specified
    seer, meaning it will remain visible regardless of distance or other visibility
    conditions. It is commonly used in player visibility calculations and game mechanics
    related to object visibility. The method returns true when the object is always
    visible to the seer, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    proper visibility in World of Warcraft's client-server communication.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: The WorldObject that is checking visibility. This is typically a
      player or unit that needs to see the object.
  returns: Returns true if the object is always visible to the seer, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the object should remain visible even when normally invisible
    due to distance or other factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (object->IsAlwaysVisibleFor(player)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks against visibility flags
    or special visibility conditions that override normal distance-based visibility
    rules. Performance considerations: This method may be called frequently during
    visibility calculations, so it should be optimized for performance.'
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for standard visibility
    checks; it's meant for specific cases where visibility needs to be overridden.
    Common mistakes include misunderstanding that this method returns true for all
    objects, when in fact it only returns true for objects that are always visible
    regardless of normal conditions.
