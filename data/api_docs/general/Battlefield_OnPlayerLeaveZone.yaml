  class: Battlefield
  method: OnPlayerLeaveZone
  signature: void Battlefield::OnPlayerLeaveZone(Player * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles player leave zone events for battlefield instances
  description: The OnPlayerLeaveZone method is invoked when a player exits a battlefield
    zone, typically during battleground or arena matches. This method manages cleanup
    operations such as removing player from battlefield data structures, updating
    player state, and potentially triggering victory/defeat conditions. It ensures
    proper synchronization of player status with the battlefield's internal state
    and may handle rewards distribution or penalty application based on the player's
    departure timing and match outcome.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object that has left the battlefield zone
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom battlefield implementation
    code: "class MyBattlefield : public Battlefield\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerLeaveZone(Player*\
      \ player) override\n    {\n        // Remove player from battlefield data structures\n\
      \        RemovePlayerFromBattlefield(player);\n        \n        // Update player's\
      \ battlefield status\n        player->SetBattlegroundId(0);\n        \n    \
      \    // Handle any cleanup or reward logic\n        HandlePlayerLeaveCleanup(player);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the core battleground system when a
    player's zone change event is detected. Developers should ensure that all battlefield-specific
    data associated with the player is properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
    or inconsistent state. The method may be invoked multiple times for the same player
    during a single match if they leave and re-enter.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to players remaining in invalid
    states, causing issues with battleground completion, reward distribution, or server
    stability. Always validate that the player pointer is not null before performing
    operations on it.
