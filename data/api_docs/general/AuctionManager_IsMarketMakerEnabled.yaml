documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the market maker functionality is enabled for the auction
    manager.
  description: The IsMarketMakerEnabled method determines if the market maker feature
    is active within the auction system. This functionality allows NPCs or systems
    to automatically manage and update auction listings, such as setting prices based
    on market demand or availability. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the current state of this feature. This check is typically used before performing
    operations that rely on market maker behavior, ensuring that the auction system
    behaves correctly according to the configured settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the market maker functionality is enabled; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (auctionMgr->IsMarketMakerEnabled()) {\n    // Perform market maker\
      \ related operations\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"auction\", \"Market maker is enabled\"\
      );\n} else {\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"auction\", \"Market maker is disabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a simple getter that reads from an internal flag or
    configuration setting. It's expected to be fast and thread-safe as it only retrieves
    a boolean value without side effects.
