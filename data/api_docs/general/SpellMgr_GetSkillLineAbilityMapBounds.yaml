  class: SpellMgr
  method: GetSkillLineAbilityMapBounds
  signature: SkillLineAbilityMapBounds SpellMgr::GetSkillLineAbilityMapBounds(uint32
    spell_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bounds of the skill line ability map for a given spell ID.
  description: The GetSkillLineAbilityMapBounds method retrieves the range of entries
    within the skill line ability map that correspond to a specific spell ID. This
    is used internally by the TrinityCore server to manage and query spell-to-skill
    line relationships, particularly in the context of profession and skill systems.
    The returned SkillLineAbilityMapBounds object typically contains iterators or
    indices that define the start and end of a range of entries related to the specified
    spell. This method is essential for operations involving spell learning, skill
    progression, and ability acquisition mechanics within World of Warcraft's game
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SkillLineAbilityMapBounds object representing the range of entries in
    the skill line ability map associated with the specified spell ID. The exact structure
    of this object depends on the internal implementation but generally provides access
    to the beginning and end of a container range for efficient iteration or lookup.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve bounds for a specific spell
    code: "uint32 spellId = 12345;\nSpellMgr::SkillLineAbilityMapBounds bounds = sSpellMgr->GetSkillLineAbilityMapBounds(spellId);\n\
      // Use bounds to iterate over related skill line abilities\nfor (auto itr =\
      \ bounds.first; itr != bounds.second; ++itr)\n{\n    // Process each skill line\
      \ ability entry\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell management
    functions within the SpellMgr class. It's important to note that the returned
    bounds may be empty if no skill line abilities are associated with the given spell
    ID. The implementation likely uses internal data structures optimized for fast
    lookup, such as hash maps or sorted containers.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual spell in the database. Invalid spell IDs may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect range bounds. Additionally, since this is a const method, it should
    not modify any internal state of the SpellMgr instance.
