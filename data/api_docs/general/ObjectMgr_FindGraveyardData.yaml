    zone) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves graveyard data for a specified zone ID
  description: The FindGraveyardData method searches the internal graveyard database
    for a matching graveyard entry based on the provided zone identifier. It returns
    a pointer to the GraveyardData structure if found, or nullptr if no matching graveyard
    exists for the given zone. This method is typically used during player death processing
    and zone transitions to determine appropriate graveyard locations. The method
    performs a lookup in the object manager's graveyard cache and does not modify
    any persistent data.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the graveyard to find
  - name: zone
    description: The zone ID for which to search for a graveyard
  returns: A pointer to the GraveyardData structure if a matching graveyard is found,
    or nullptr if no graveyard exists for the specified zone ID
  examples:
  - title: Find graveyard data for a specific zone
    code: "const GraveyardData* graveyard = sObjectMgr->FindGraveyardData(0, 1234);\n\
      if (graveyard)\n{\n    // Use the graveyard data\n    printf(\"Found graveyard\
      \ at %u, %u\\n\", graveyard->x, graveyard->y);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if a zone has a graveyard before player death
    code: "uint32 zoneId = player->GetZoneId();\nconst GraveyardData* graveyard =\
      \ sObjectMgr->FindGraveyardData(0, zoneId);\nif (!graveyard)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ case where no graveyard exists for this zone\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      No graveyard available in this zone.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from cached data structures.
    The method performs a lookup operation that should be relatively fast due to internal
    indexing, but performance may vary depending on the number of registered graveyards.
    The returned pointer is valid only for the lifetime of the ObjectMgr instance
    and should not be stored or used after the manager has been destroyed.
  warnings: The method returns nullptr when no graveyard is found, so always check
    the return value before dereferencing. Using an invalid zone ID may result in
    a null return, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly handled.
    The method does not validate whether the returned graveyard data is actually usable
    for player death mechanics.
