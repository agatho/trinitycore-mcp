  brief: Removes expired or invalid entries from the loot analysis cache.
  description: The CleanupCache method is responsible for maintaining the integrity
    of the LootAnalysis system by removing outdated or invalid entries from its internal
    cache. This ensures that the system does not retain unnecessary data that could
    impact performance or lead to incorrect loot analysis results. The method typically
    runs periodically or upon specific events such as player logout or zone changes.
    It may also be triggered manually in certain scenarios where immediate cache cleanup
    is required.
