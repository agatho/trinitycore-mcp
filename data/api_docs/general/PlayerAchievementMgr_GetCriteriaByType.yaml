  class: PlayerAchievementMgr
  method: GetCriteriaByType
  signature: const CriteriaList & PlayerAchievementMgr::GetCriteriaByType(int type,
    uint32 asset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of criteria associated with a specific achievement type
    and asset.
  description: The GetCriteriaByType method fetches all criteria entries that match
    the specified achievement type and asset identifier. This is used internally by
    the achievement system to determine which criteria should be evaluated for a given
    achievement. The method returns a constant reference to a CriteriaList, which
    contains all matching criteria. It is typically called during achievement evaluation
    or when building the UI for achievements. The asset parameter allows filtering
    criteria based on specific contextual data such as quest ID, item ID, or zone
    ID depending on the type of achievement being evaluated.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of achievement criteria to retrieve. This corresponds to
      predefined criterion types used by the achievement system (e.g., kill creature,
      complete quest, etc.). Valid values are defined in the AchievementCriteriaType
      enum.
  - name: asset
    description: The asset identifier associated with the criteria. The meaning of
      this value depends on the type parameter - for example, it could represent a
      quest ID, creature entry, item entry, or zone ID depending on the criterion
      type being queried.
  returns: A constant reference to a CriteriaList containing all criteria entries
    that match the specified type and asset. The list may be empty if no matching
    criteria are found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve criteria for killing a specific creature
    code: "CriteriaList const& criteria = playerAchievementMgr.GetCriteriaByType(ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_TYPE_KILL_CREATURE,\
      \ 12345);\nfor (auto const& criterion : criteria)\n{\n    // Process each matching\
      \ criterion\n    printf(\"Criterion ID: %u\\n\", criterion.ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Get quest completion criteria for a specific quest
    code: "uint32 questId = 10245;\nCriteriaList const& criteria = playerAchievementMgr.GetCriteriaByType(ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_TYPE_COMPLETE_QUEST,\
      \ questId);\nif (!criteria.empty())\n{\n    // Handle achievement criteria related\
      \ to completing the quest\n    for (auto const& criterion : criteria)\n    {\n\
      \        printf(\"Quest completion criterion: %u\\n\", criterion.ID);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in an internal data structure. The
    CriteriaList returned is a reference to internal storage and should not be modified
    directly. The method is designed to be efficient for frequent calls during achievement
    evaluation. It assumes that the type and asset parameters are valid according
    to the achievement system's expected values.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned CriteriaList as it points to internal data.
    Modifications may cause unexpected behavior or crashes. Ensure that both 'type'
    and 'asset' parameters are valid before calling this method, as invalid parameters
    might lead to undefined results or performance degradation.
