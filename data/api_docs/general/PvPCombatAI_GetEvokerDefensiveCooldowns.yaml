  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetEvokerDefensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the defensive cooldowns for an evoker player class in PvP combat.
  description: The GetEvokerDefensiveCooldowns method retrieves the current defensive
    cooldown values associated with an evoker's abilities during PvP encounters. This
    method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and is used to determine how many defensive
    cooldowns are available for an evoker character. The method takes a pointer to
    a player object as input and returns an integer representing the count or state
    of defensive cooldowns. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment, this functionality
    supports PvP balance by tracking cooldown states for evoker-specific defensive
    spells and abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to a Player object representing the evoker player whose defensive
      cooldowns are being queried. This parameter must point to a valid player instance
      with evoker class data.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the number or state of defensive cooldowns
    for the evoker. A positive value typically represents active cooldowns, zero may
    indicate no cooldowns, and negative values might represent error conditions or
    special states depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* evokerPlayer = ...; // Get reference to evoker player\nint cooldowns\
      \ = pvpCombatAI->GetEvokerDefensiveCooldowns(evokerPlayer);\nif (cooldowns >\
      \ 0) {\n    // Evoker has defensive cooldowns available\n    printf(\"Evoker\
      \ has %d defensive cooldowns\\n\", cooldowns);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: PvP Combat State Check
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume we have a valid player reference\nPvPCombatAI*\
      \ ai = ...; // Assume we have access to PvP combat AI\nint cooldownCount = ai->GetEvokerDefensiveCooldowns(player);\n\
      if (cooldownCount == 0) {\n    // No defensive cooldowns available, check for\
      \ spell usage\n    // Implement logic to handle evoker's defensive abilities\n\
      }\nelse if (cooldownCount > 0) {\n    // Defensive cooldowns are active\n  \
      \  // Adjust combat strategy accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger PvP AI system that manages class-specific
    abilities and cooldowns. The implementation may vary based on the current game
    state, player level, and specific PvP rules in effect. Developers should ensure
    that the player object passed to this method is valid and represents an evoker
    class before calling to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or a player object that does not represent an evoker
    class may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate the input parameter
    before calling this method in production code.
