  method: SmoothPath
  signature: bool PathOptimizer::SmoothPath(MovementPath & path, Map * map, float
    smoothingFactor)
documentation:
  brief: Smooths a movement path using a specified smoothing factor.
  description: The SmoothPath method applies a smoothing algorithm to a given MovementPath
    to reduce sharp turns and create more natural-looking movement for units in World
    of Warcraft. This is particularly useful for NPC movement, creature pathfinding,
    and ensuring that character movement appears fluid and realistic. The method modifies
    the input path in-place and returns true if the smoothing operation was successful,
    false otherwise. The smoothing factor controls how aggressively the path is smoothed,
    with higher values producing smoother but potentially less accurate paths.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: Reference to the MovementPath object that will be smoothed in-place.
      This contains the sequence of waypoints that define the movement path.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the path is located. Used for collision
      detection and terrain validation during smoothing.
  - name: smoothingFactor
    description: Float value controlling the aggressiveness of the smoothing algorithm.
      Higher values produce smoother paths but may deviate more from the original
      waypoints. Typical values range from 0.1 to 1.0.
  returns: Boolean indicating whether the smoothing operation was successful. Returns
    true if the path was successfully smoothed, false if an error occurred during
    processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Smoothing
    code: "MovementPath path;\n// ... populate path with waypoints ...\nMap* map =\
      \ player->GetMap();\nfloat smoothingFactor = 0.5f;\nbool success = PathOptimizer::SmoothPath(path,\
      \ map, smoothingFactor);\nif (success) {\n    // Path has been smoothed successfully\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Path Smoothing with Error Handling
    code: "MovementPath path;\n// ... populate path with waypoints ...\nMap* map =\
      \ player->GetMap();\nfloat smoothingFactor = 0.8f;\n\nif (path.empty()) {\n\
      \    // Handle empty path case\n    return false;\n}\n\nbool success = PathOptimizer::SmoothPath(path,\
      \ map, smoothingFactor);\nif (!success) {\n    // Log error or handle failure\
      \ case\n    LOG_ERROR(\"movement\", \"Failed to smooth movement path\");\n \
      \   return false;\n}\n\n// Use the smoothed path for unit movement\nreturn true;"
    language: cpp
  notes: The smoothing algorithm likely uses a form of spline interpolation or similar
    technique to adjust waypoints. The method performs collision checks against the
    provided map to ensure that smoothed paths do not go through solid terrain. Performance
    may be impacted by the number of waypoints in the path and the smoothing factor
    used.
  warnings: Passing an invalid map pointer or null path reference can lead to undefined
    behavior. Very high smoothing factors may cause the path to become overly smoothed,
    potentially resulting in movement that deviates significantly from intended waypoints
    or even goes through obstacles.
