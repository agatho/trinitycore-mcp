  signature: void MechanicAwareness::LogMechanicDetection(const MechanicInfo & mechanic)
documentation:
  brief: Logs detection of a mechanic for debugging and monitoring purposes.
  description: The LogMechanicDetection method records information about a detected
    mechanic within the game environment. This function is typically used in the context
    of AI behavior or game mechanics to track when specific actions or conditions
    are met. It allows developers to monitor and debug mechanic-related events, such
    as player abilities, spell effects, or environmental triggers. The method accepts
    a MechanicInfo object that contains details about the detected mechanic, including
    its type, duration, and associated data. This logging capability is essential
    for analyzing gameplay behavior, identifying issues in mechanic implementation,
    and ensuring proper game balance.
  parameters:
  - name: mechanic
    description: A reference to a MechanicInfo object containing detailed information
      about the detected mechanic, including type, duration, and associated data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MechanicInfo info;

      info.type = MECHANIC_STUN;

      info.duration = 5000;

      mechanicAwareness.LogMechanicDetection(info);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Custom Data
    code: 'MechanicInfo info;

      info.type = MECHANIC_ROOT;

      info.duration = 3000;

      info.sourceGuid = player->GetGUID();

      info.targetGuid = target->GetGUID();

      mechanicAwareness.LogMechanicDetection(info);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely writes to a debug log or internal tracking system. It
    should be used primarily during development and debugging phases rather than in
    production builds due to potential performance impact from frequent logging.
  warnings: Ensure that the MechanicInfo object passed to this method is properly
    initialized before calling, as invalid data could lead to incorrect logging or
    crashes. Avoid calling this method excessively in performance-critical code paths.
