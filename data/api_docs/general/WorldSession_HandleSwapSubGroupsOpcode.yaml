  brief: Handles the opcode for swapping subgroup positions within a party or raid
  description: This method processes the SwapSubGroups opcode sent by the client when
    a player attempts to rearrange their party or raid members between subgroups.
    The function validates the request and updates the internal subgroup assignments
    accordingly, ensuring that the group's organizational structure is maintained.
    It typically occurs during party/raid management operations where players reorganize
    their groups for better coordination during instances or dungeons. The method
    operates on the WorldPackets::Party::SwapSubGroups packet which contains information
    about the source and destination subgroups involved in the swap operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSwapSubGroupsOpcode(WorldPackets::Party::SwapSubGroups&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Validate that the player is in a group\n    if (!GetPlayer()->GetGroup())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Process the subgroup swap request\n    GetPlayer()->GetGroup()->SwapSubGroups(packet.SourceSubGroup,\
      \ packet.DestinationSubGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the party management system and relies on the group's
    internal state to perform subgroup swaps. The actual implementation may involve
    synchronization with other players in the group to ensure consistent view of subgroup
    assignments across all clients.
