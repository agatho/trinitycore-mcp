  class: ProtectionShieldTracker
  method: GetTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 ProtectionShieldTracker::GetTimeRemaining() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for the protection shield effect.
  description: The GetTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration left on a protection
    shield that has been applied to a unit. This value represents how many milliseconds
    remain before the shield expires and is no longer active. The method is typically
    used in combat systems to determine when a protective effect will end, allowing
    for proper handling of shield-related mechanics such as damage absorption, visual
    effects, or cooldown resets. It returns zero if the shield is not currently active
    or has already expired.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time in milliseconds remaining on the protection
    shield. Returns 0 if no shield is active or if the shield has expired.
  examples:
  - title: Check Shield Expiry
    code: "if (uint32 timeLeft = tracker->GetTimeRemaining()) {\n    // Shield is\
      \ active, do something with remaining time\n    printf(\"Shield expires in %u\
      \ ms\\n\", timeLeft);\n} else {\n    // Shield has expired or is not active\n\
      \    printf(\"No active shield\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update UI Based on Shield Time
    code: "uint32 remaining = tracker->GetTimeRemaining();\nif (remaining > 0) {\n\
      \    // Update UI element to show shield countdown\n    uiElement->SetProgress(remaining,\
      \ maxShieldDuration);\n} else {\n    // Hide or disable shield UI elements\n\
      \    uiElement->Hide();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ProtectionShieldTracker object is properly initialized
    and associated with a valid unit. The returned time value should be treated as
    a snapshot at the moment of calling, and may change immediately after due to shield
    updates or expiration.
  warnings: Ensure that the ProtectionShieldTracker instance is not null before calling
    this method. Calling GetTimeRemaining on an uninitialized or destroyed tracker
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect values.
