  class: DynObjAura
  method: Remove
  signature: void DynObjAura::Remove(AuraRemoveMode removeMode)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the aura from the dynamic object and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The Remove method is responsible for removing an aura effect from a
    dynamic object within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically gets invoked
    when an aura's duration expires, is manually removed, or when the dynamic object
    itself is destroyed. It ensures proper cleanup of aura-related data structures
    and may trigger any associated removal handlers or callbacks. The method takes
    an AuraRemoveMode parameter that determines how the aura should be removed, such
    as by expiration, cancellation, or dispel effects. This operation is critical
    for maintaining memory integrity and preventing dangling references in the game's
    aura system.
  parameters:
  - name: removeMode
    description: Specifies the mode of removal for the aura. Valid values include
      AURA_REMOVE_BY_DEFAULT, AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE, AURA_REMOVE_BY_CANCEL, AURA_REMOVE_BY_DISPEL,
      and others defined in the AuraRemoveMode enum. This determines how the aura
      cleanup is handled and what events are triggered during removal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Removal
    code: 'DynObjAura* aura = ...;

      aura->Remove(AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Aura on Dispel
    code: 'DynObjAura* aura = ...;

      aura->Remove(AURA_REMOVE_BY_DISPEL);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid DynObjAura instances. Calling
    Remove on a destroyed or already-removed aura can lead to undefined behavior.
    The method internally handles the removal of visual effects, updates the dynamic
    object's aura list, and may notify other systems about the aura's removal.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are certain that the aura
    is still valid and managed by the system. Improper usage can lead to memory corruption
    or crashes. Avoid calling Remove multiple times on the same aura instance as it
    may cause double-free errors.
