  method: SetInvitee
  signature: void CalendarInvite::SetInvitee(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the player invited to a calendar event
  description: The SetInvitee method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to a calendar
    invite, linking it to a specific player in the game. This method is typically
    used when creating or modifying calendar invitations within the TrinityCore framework.
    The GUID represents the target player who will receive the invitation. This method
    does not validate whether the GUID corresponds to an actual online player, and
    it's expected that validation occurs elsewhere in the system. The invitee GUID
    is stored internally and can be retrieved using the corresponding getter method.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player being invited to the calendar
      event. Must be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore database system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an invitee GUID for a calendar event
    code: 'CalendarInvite invite;

      invite.SetInvitee(12345);

      // The invite now references player with GUID 12345 as the invitee'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting invitee in a calendar event creation context
    code: "void CreateCalendarEventInvite(uint32 eventId, uint32 inviteeGuid) {\n\
      \    CalendarInvite invite;\n    invite.SetInvitee(inviteeGuid);\n    // Additional\
      \ logic to associate the invite with the event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly sets the internal GUID field of the calendar invite.
    It is recommended to validate that the provided GUID corresponds to an existing
    player before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior in the game system.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter refers to a valid player entity, as invalid
    GUIDs may cause issues with event handling or database consistency. This method
    does not perform any automatic validation or error checking on the input GUID.
