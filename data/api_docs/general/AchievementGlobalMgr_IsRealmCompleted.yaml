documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the entire realm has completed a specific achievement.
  description: The IsRealmCompleted method determines if all players on the realm
    have earned a particular achievement. This is used in conjunction with realm-wide
    achievements that are tracked globally across the entire game world. The method
    evaluates the completion status of the given achievement entry against the realm's
    overall progress. It typically returns true when every player character on the
    realm has met the requirements for the specified achievement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all players on the realm have completed the specified achievement,
    false otherwise. The method may also return false if the achievement is not a
    realm-wide type or if no players have earned it yet.
  examples:
  - title: Check if realm has completed a specific achievement
    code: "const AchievementEntry* entry = sAchievementMgr->GetAchievement(12345);\n\
      if (sAchievementGlobalMgr->IsRealmCompleted(entry))\n{\n    // All players on\
      \ the realm have earned this achievement\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(\"All players\
      \ have completed the achievement!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a global check across all player characters in
    the realm, which could be computationally expensive for large realms. It's typically
    used for achievements that are meant to be completed by the entire server population
    rather than individual players.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with frequently updated achievements
    as it may cause performance issues on large realms. The method may not work correctly
    with achievements that are not designed to be realm-wide.
