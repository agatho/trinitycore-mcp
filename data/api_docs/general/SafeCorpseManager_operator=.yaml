documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one SafeCorpseManager object to another
  description: The assignment operator for SafeCorpseManager performs a deep copy
    of all internal data members from the source object to the target object. This
    method ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of corpse-related
    data structures, preventing shared state issues. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, this operation is typically used when transferring corpse management
    responsibilities between different systems or when duplicating corpse manager
    instances for temporary use. The assignment preserves all corpse references and
    associated metadata while maintaining thread safety considerations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source SafeCorpseManager object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current SafeCorpseManager object, allowing for chained
    assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'SafeCorpseManager manager1;

      SafeCorpseManager manager2 = manager1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      manager2 = manager1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'SafeCorpseManager mgrA, mgrB, mgrC;

      // Perform multiple assignments

      mgrA = mgrB = mgrC; // Chained assignment

      // This is equivalent to:

      mgrA = mgrB;

      mgrB = mgrC;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements copy-on-write semantics or deep copying for
    internal data structures. The implementation should handle potential memory allocation
    failures gracefully. In TrinityCore's context, this method may be used during
    player logout processing when corpse data needs to be transferred between different
    manager instances.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large SafeCorpseManager objects as it may cause
    performance overhead due to deep copying of internal structures. Ensure that the
    source object remains valid throughout the assignment operation to avoid undefined
    behavior.
