documentation:
  brief: Checks if the spell has sufficient power to cast
  description: The CheckPower method evaluates whether a spell has the required mana,
    rage, energy, or focus resources to be cast. It performs a comprehensive check
    of the spell's power requirements against the caster's current resource levels.
    This method is crucial for determining spell validity and preventing casting errors
    in World of Warcraft's spell system. The method returns a SpellCastResult indicating
    whether the spell can proceed with casting or if it fails due to insufficient
    resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: SpellCastResult indicating whether the spell can be cast or if it fails
    due to insufficient power resources. Possible return values include SPELL_CAST_OK,
    SPELL_FAILED_NO_POWER, SPELL_FAILED_NOT_ENOUGH_POWER, and others depending on
    the specific power requirements and resource types.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell->CheckPower();\nif (result == SPELL_CAST_OK)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with casting\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error condition\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell validation and should be used
    in conjunction with other spell checking methods. It's important to note that
    the method may return different results based on the caster's class and resource
    type, as well as the specific spell being checked.
  warnings: The method may fail even when the spell has sufficient resources if the
    caster is in a state where power cannot be consumed (such as during stealth or
    while under certain effects). It's crucial to check for valid casting conditions
    before calling this method.
