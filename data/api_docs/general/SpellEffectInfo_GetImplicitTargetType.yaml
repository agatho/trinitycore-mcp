    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the implicit target type associated with a spell effect.
  description: The GetImplicitTargetType method returns the SpellEffectImplicitTargetTypes
    enumeration value that defines how targets are implicitly determined for a given
    spell effect. This is used internally by the TrinityCore spell system to determine
    which entities (such as caster, area, or nearby enemies) should be targeted when
    no explicit target is provided. The implicit target type influences the behavior
    of spells like area-of-effect effects, self-targeting spells, and those that automatically
    target nearby enemies or allies based on game rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellEffectImplicitTargetTypes enumeration value indicating the implicit
    targeting behavior for this spell effect. Possible values include TARGET_TYPE_NONE,
    TARGET_TYPE_UNIT_CASTER, TARGET_TYPE_DEST_CASTER, TARGET_TYPE_UNIT_NEARBY_ENEMY,
    etc., depending on how the spell effect should implicitly determine its targets.
  examples:
  - title: Check implicit target type of a spell effect
    code: "SpellEffectInfo const* effect = spellInfo->GetEffect(0);\nif (effect)\n\
      {\n    SpellEffectImplicitTargetTypes targetType = effect->GetImplicitTargetType();\n\
      \    if (targetType == TARGET_TYPE_UNIT_CASTER)\n    {\n        // This effect\
      \ always targets the caster\n        sLog->outString(\"Spell effect targets\
      \ the caster.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell effect handling system in TrinityCore and
    should be used during spell processing or when analyzing spell data. The returned
    value directly affects how spell targets are resolved during execution, so it's
    important to understand the implications of different target types for gameplay
    balance.
