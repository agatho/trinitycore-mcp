documentation:
  brief: Processes all pending bot spawner events in the lifecycle manager.
  description: The ProcessSpawnerEvents method handles the execution of queued bot
    spawning operations within the BotLifecycleMgr. This method iterates through all
    registered spawner events and executes them according to their defined conditions
    and timing. It is typically called during the game loop to ensure that bots are
    spawned or managed according to configured rules and schedules. The method ensures
    proper synchronization and state management for all bot lifecycle operations.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    sBotLifecycleMgr->ProcessSpawnerEvents();\n\
      \    // ... continue with game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game update cycle to ensure
    timely processing of bot spawner events. It is designed to be thread-safe and
    can be safely invoked from different threads as long as proper synchronization
    mechanisms are in place.
