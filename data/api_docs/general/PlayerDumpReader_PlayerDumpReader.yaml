documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PlayerDumpReader class for processing player
    data dumps.
  description: The PlayerDumpReader constructor initializes the internal state and
    resources required to read and parse player data dumps from the TrinityCore database.
    This class is typically used during server startup or administrative operations
    to load player information from dump files, which may contain character data,
    inventory items, achievements, and other player-related statistics. The constructor
    sets up necessary data structures and prepares the reader for subsequent parsing
    operations. It does not perform any actual reading of dump files; that functionality
    is provided by other methods in the class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a PlayerDumpReader instance
    code: 'PlayerDumpReader reader;

      // The reader is now initialized and ready to process player dumps'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any I/O operations or file access. It only
    initializes internal data structures. The actual reading of dump files should
    be performed using methods like ReadDump() or similar parsing functions provided
    by the class.
