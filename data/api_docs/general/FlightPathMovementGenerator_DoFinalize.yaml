  class: FlightPathMovementGenerator
  method: DoFinalize
  signature: void FlightPathMovementGenerator::DoFinalize(Player * param0, bool param1,
    bool param2)
documentation:
  brief: Finalizes flight path movement for a player, completing the flight and updating
    player state.
  description: The DoFinalize method in FlightPathMovementGenerator is responsible
    for cleaning up and finalizing the execution of a flight path movement. It ensures
    that all flight-related resources are properly released, the player's movement
    state is updated, and any necessary post-flight actions are performed. This method
    is typically invoked when a player has completed their flight path or when the
    flight movement needs to be forcibly terminated. The method handles cleanup of
    internal flight path data structures and may trigger related events or callbacks
    to notify other systems about the completion of the flight.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the flight path movement is
      being finalized
  - name: param1
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to update the player's position to
      the final destination
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to send movement updates to the player's
      client
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in flight path completion
    code: "void CompleteFlightPath(Player* player)\n{\n    FlightPathMovementGenerator\
      \ generator;\n    generator.DoFinalize(player, true, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced termination of flight path
    code: "void CancelFlightPath(Player* player)\n{\n    FlightPathMovementGenerator\
      \ generator;\n    generator.DoFinalize(player, false, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the movement generator's internal
    execution context. It is not intended for direct public API usage and may cause
    undefined behavior if invoked incorrectly. The method assumes that all necessary
    preconditions for flight path completion have already been validated.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of flight path state may
    result in inconsistent player state or client-server synchronization issues. Avoid
    calling DoFinalize on players who are not currently executing a flight path movement.
