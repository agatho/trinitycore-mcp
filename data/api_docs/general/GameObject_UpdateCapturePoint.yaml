documentation:
  brief: Updates the capture point state for the game object, typically used in battlegrounds
    or zones with contested territories.
  description: The UpdateCapturePoint method is responsible for managing and updating
    the capture state of a GameObject, particularly in battleground scenarios where
    control of objectives changes over time. This method likely checks current ownership,
    updates faction control, and may trigger related events or visual changes to reflect
    the new capture status. It's commonly used with objects like capture points, flags,
    or territorial markers that change control based on player activity or team dominance.
    The method typically operates as part of the GameObject's update cycle and may
    interact with the surrounding world state to ensure accurate representation of
    contested areas.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Object Update
    code: "void GameObject::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    UpdateCapturePoint();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Capture Point Logic
    code: "void CapturePointGameObject::UpdateCapturePoint()\n{\n    if (IsInBattleground())\n\
      \    {\n        UpdateCapturePoint();\n        // Handle faction changes, visual\
      \ updates, etc.\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the GameObject's update cycle and
    may involve checking player proximity, faction control, and battleground state.
    It's designed to be efficient as it's called frequently for active capture points
    in battlegrounds.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the underlying
    capture point mechanics. Improper usage could lead to incorrect faction control
    states or visual inconsistencies in battlegrounds.
