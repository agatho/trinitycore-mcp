  signature: bool ArenaAI::CoordinateCCChain(int * player, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates a chain of crowd control effects between a player and target
    in an arena environment
  description: The CoordinateCCChain method manages the execution and coordination
    of crowd control abilities within the ArenaAI framework. This method determines
    whether a sequence of crowd control effects can be successfully applied from a
    player to a target, considering factors such as cooldowns, mana costs, and target
    eligibility. It evaluates the current state of both entities to ensure that the
    chain of control effects is valid and executable. The method plays a crucial role
    in arena combat AI behavior, particularly when managing complex control sequences
    involving multiple abilities or talents.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      within the arena context
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the arena context
  returns: Returns true if the crowd control chain coordination was successful and
    all conditions were met, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates
    that either the player or target is invalid, insufficient resources exist, or
    the chain sequence cannot be executed due to game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic CC Chain Coordination
    code: "int playerIndex = 0;\nint targetIndex = 1;\nbool success = arenaAI->CoordinateCCChain(&playerIndex,\
      \ &targetIndex);\nif (success) {\n    // Proceed with executing the coordinated\
      \ crowd control sequence\n    printf(\"CC chain coordinated successfully\\n\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case - possibly retry or select alternative\
      \ ability\n    printf(\"CC chain coordination failed\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced CC Chain with Error Handling
    code: "int playerIndex = GetPlayerIndex();\nint targetIndex = GetTargetIndex();\n\
      \n// Validate inputs before attempting coordination\nif (playerIndex < 0 ||\
      \ targetIndex < 0) {\n    printf(\"Invalid player or target index\\n\");\n \
      \   return false;\n}\n\nbool result = arenaAI->CoordinateCCChain(&playerIndex,\
      \ &targetIndex);\nswitch(result) {\n    case true:\n        printf(\"Crowd control\
      \ chain successfully coordinated\\n\");\n        break;\n    case false:\n \
      \       printf(\"Failed to coordinate crowd control chain\\n\");\n        //\
      \ Implement fallback behavior\n        break;\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ArenaAI subsystem that governs player behavior
    in competitive arena environments. The implementation likely involves checking
    various game state variables such as cooldown timers, mana availability, and target
    validity. It may also interact with other AI systems to ensure proper sequencing
    of abilities. Performance-wise, this method should be efficient as it's called
    frequently during arena combat.
  warnings: This method assumes valid pointer inputs for player and target. Passing
    null pointers or invalid indices can lead to undefined behavior. The method does
    not validate the actual existence of players or targets in the arena - that responsibility
    lies with the calling code. Improper use may result in failed crowd control sequences
    or unexpected AI behavior.
