  class: Item
  method: CopyArtifactDataFromParent
  signature: void Item::CopyArtifactDataFromParent(Item * parent)
documentation:
  brief: Copies artifact data from a parent item to this item instance.
  description: The CopyArtifactDataFromParent method transfers all relevant artifact
    properties and data from a specified parent item to the current item instance.
    This functionality is primarily used in World of Warcraft's artifact system where
    items may inherit or clone artifact characteristics from their parent items during
    operations such as item duplication, crafting, or transformation. The method ensures
    that artifact-specific attributes like artifact power, artifact traits, and other
    related metadata are properly propagated to maintain consistency in the game's
    artifact mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: parent
    description: Pointer to the parent Item object from which artifact data will be
      copied. Must not be null and must represent a valid item with artifact data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying Artifact Data Between Items
    code: "Item* parentItem = player->GetItemByGuid(parentGuid);\nItem* newItem =\
      \ player->AddItem(itemTemplateId, 1);\nif (parentItem && newItem)\n{\n    newItem->CopyArtifactDataFromParent(parentItem);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during item creation or modification processes
    involving artifact items. It's important to ensure that the parent item actually
    contains artifact data before calling this method, otherwise the operation may
    not have the intended effect. The implementation likely involves copying internal
    artifact state variables and updating relevant caches.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null parent pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Additionally, if the parent item does not contain valid artifact
    data, the copied data may be incomplete or invalid, potentially causing issues
    in artifact progression systems.
