  class: MapObject
  method: SetCurrentCell
  signature: void MapObject::SetCurrentCell(const int & cell)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the current cell position of the map object within the game world.
  description: The SetCurrentCell method updates the internal cell coordinate of a
    MapObject, which represents its location in the game world's grid-based spatial
    partitioning system. This method is typically used during object movement or spawning
    to ensure that the object's cell reference matches its current position. The cell
    coordinate is used for efficient object management, visibility calculations, and
    network updates. When an object moves from one cell to another, this method must
    be called to maintain proper spatial indexing and ensure that other systems can
    correctly locate and manage the object.
  parameters:
  - name: cell
    description: The new cell coordinate value representing the object's current location
      in the world grid. This is typically a signed integer value that corresponds
      to the cell's position within the map's spatial partitioning system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Current Cell During Object Movement
    code: 'MapObject* obj = ...;

      int newCell = 150;

      obj->SetCurrentCell(newCell);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Cell Position After Coordinate Change
    code: 'MapObject* player = GetPlayer();

      float x, y, z;

      player->GetPosition(x, y, z);

      int cellX = (int)(x / GRID_SIZE);

      int cellY = (int)(y / GRID_SIZE);

      int newCell = cellX * 1000 + cellY; // Assuming a simple grid encoding

      player->SetCurrentCell(newCell);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the object's position has actually
    changed to a different cell. Frequent calls with identical values may cause unnecessary
    overhead in cell management systems. The method does not perform any validation
    on the cell value, so invalid coordinates could lead to undefined behavior or
    spatial indexing issues.
  warnings: Calling this method with an incorrect cell value can result in objects
    becoming invisible or incorrectly positioned in the game world. Never call this
    method without ensuring that the object's actual position has changed to a new
    cell coordinate.
