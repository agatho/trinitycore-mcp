  brief: Updates all honor-related fields for the player, including honor points,
    rank, and related statistics.
  description: The UpdateHonorFields method is responsible for refreshing and synchronizing
    all honor-related data for a Player instance. This includes updating honor points,
    honor rank, lifetime kills, and other associated honor statistics. The method
    ensures that the player's honor data remains consistent with the game's internal
    systems and is typically called when honor-related values change or when the player
    logs in. It handles the necessary updates to player fields and may trigger UI
    refreshes for honor displays.

  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core when honor points
    are modified or during login sequence. It may trigger updates to the player's
    client-side honor display and should not be called excessively as it involves
    field updates and potential UI refreshes.
