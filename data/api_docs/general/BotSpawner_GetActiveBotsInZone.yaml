  class: BotSpawner
  method: GetActiveBotsInZone
  signature: int BotSpawner::GetActiveBotsInZone(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of active bot characters within a specified zone.
  description: The GetActiveBotsInZone method returns the number of bot characters
    currently active and present in the given zone. This functionality is typically
    used by the BotSpawner class to monitor or manage bot populations per zone, which
    can be crucial for balancing gameplay or triggering zone-specific events. The
    method does not distinguish between different types of bots but counts all active
    bots within the specified zone ID. It assumes that the zone ID provided corresponds
    to a valid in-game zone and that bot management is enabled in the server configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of active bot characters found
    in the specified zone. Returns zero if no bots are active in the zone or if the
    zone ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Count Active Bots in a Specific Zone
    code: "uint32 zoneId = 1234; // Example zone ID\nint botCount = botSpawner->GetActiveBotsInZone(zoneId);\n\
      if (botCount > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << botCount << \" active bots\
      \ in zone \" << zoneId << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"No active\
      \ bots found in zone \" << zoneId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through a collection or list of active bots and
    filters them by their current zone. Performance may be impacted if the number
    of active bots is very large, though this would depend on internal implementation
    details. The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify any member
    variables.
  warnings: Ensure that the zone ID passed to this method is valid; passing an invalid
    or non-existent zone ID might lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect counts.
    This method should only be called when bot spawning and management systems are
    properly initialized.
