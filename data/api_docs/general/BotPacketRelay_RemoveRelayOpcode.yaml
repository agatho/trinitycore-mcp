  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: RemoveRelayOpcode
  signature: void BotPacketRelay::RemoveRelayOpcode(uint32 opcode)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified opcode from the packet relay list.
  description: The RemoveRelayOpcode method removes a given opcode from the internal
    list of opcodes that are being relayed by the BotPacketRelay class. This functionality
    allows for dynamic management of which network packets are forwarded between bots
    and the game server, enabling fine-grained control over bot communication behavior.
    The method operates on the assumption that the opcode has been previously added
    to the relay list using a corresponding AddRelayOpcode method.
  parameters:
  - name: opcode
    description: The opcode value to be removed from the relay list. This represents
      a specific network packet type defined by the World of Warcraft protocol.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a single opcode from relay list
    code: 'BotPacketRelay relay;

      relay.RemoveRelayOpcode(CMSG_CHAT_MESSAGE);

      // Removes CMSG_CHAT_MESSAGE from the list of opcodes being relayed'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove multiple opcodes in a loop
    code: "BotPacketRelay relay;\nstd::vector<uint32> opcodesToRemove = {CMSG_CHAT_MESSAGE,\
      \ CMSG_MOVE_SET_RUN_MODE, SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT};\nfor (uint32 opcode : opcodesToRemove)\n\
      {\n    relay.RemoveRelayOpcode(opcode);\n}\n// Removes multiple opcodes from\
      \ the relay list"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AddRelayOpcode to dynamically
    configure which packets are relayed. It's important to ensure that the opcode
    being removed was previously added to avoid unnecessary operations or potential
    errors in packet handling logic.
