  brief: Destroys a PlayerSocial object and cleans up associated social list data.
  description: The ~PlayerSocial destructor is called when a PlayerSocial object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup of memory
    allocated for storing player's social list entries, including friends, ignored
    players, and other social relationships. It handles removal of all associated
    data structures and prevents memory leaks in the TrinityCore social system. The
    destructor does not require any special preconditions as it operates on the object's
    internal state.

  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerSocial object
    code: "void CleanupPlayer(Player* player)\n{\n    // When player goes out of scope\
      \ or is deleted,\n    // its PlayerSocial member will be automatically destroyed\n\
      \    delete player;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when a PlayerSocial
    object is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. The cleanup process includes releasing
    memory for social list entries and ensuring no dangling references remain.
