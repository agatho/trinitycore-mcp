  class: ShamanAI
  method: CheckLavaSurgeProc
  signature: bool ShamanAI::CheckLavaSurgeProc()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a Lava Surge proc should be triggered for the shaman.
  description: The CheckLavaSurgeProc method determines whether the shaman's Lava
    Surge talent should activate based on current combat conditions and internal state.
    This method is typically called during spell casting or damage application to
    evaluate if the proc condition is met. The implementation checks for active Lava
    Surge buff, relevant spell types, and random chance mechanics associated with
    the talent. It ensures that Lava Surge procs are properly managed according to
    game balance rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a Lava Surge proc should be triggered, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the shaman does not have the Lava Surge buff active,
    or when the random chance condition fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell casting
    code: "if (shamanAI->CheckLavaSurgeProc())\n{\n    // Apply Lava Surge effects\n\
      \    shaman->CastSpell(target, LAVA_SURGE_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with damage application
    code: "void ShamanAI::OnDamageDealt(Unit* target, uint32 damage)\n{\n    if (CheckLavaSurgeProc())\n\
      \    {\n        // Apply additional damage or effects\n        DoLavaSurgeEffects(target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the shaman's AI system and should only be called when
    relevant combat events occur. The implementation relies on internal state tracking
    for Lava Surge buff status, which may be updated by other methods in the class.
    Performance is generally low as it only performs simple checks and random number
    generation.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called outside of appropriate combat contexts
    to avoid incorrect proc triggering. The method assumes that the shaman has the
    Lava Surge talent learned and that the buff state is properly maintained by the
    AI system.
