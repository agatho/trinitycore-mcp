  signature: void Player::SetNativeGender(int gender)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's native gender to the specified value.
  description: This method allows a player object to change its native gender to either
    male (0) or female (1). The native gender determines how the player appears in
    the game world, including their character model, voice, and other visual attributes.
    This method is typically used during character creation or when changing gender
    through gameplay mechanics such as race switching. It affects the player's appearance
    but does not alter their actual race or class. The method should be called with
    valid gender values (0 for male, 1 for female) to ensure proper behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: gender
    description: The gender value to set. 0 represents male, 1 represents female.
      Any other value will result in an invalid gender state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting player's native gender to female
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetNativeGender(1);

      // Player now appears as female in game'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting player's native gender to male
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetNativeGender(0);

      // Player now appears as male in game'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core player functionality and should be used carefully
    during character creation or when modifying gender-related attributes. It does
    not affect the player's actual race or class, but only their visual appearance.
    The method may trigger updates to the player's model and related visual components.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect visual representation
    in-game. Ensure that the gender parameter is valid (0 or 1) before calling this
    method. Using invalid values may result in undefined behavior or visual glitches.
