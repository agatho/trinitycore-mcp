  method: GetOptimalAspect
  signature: uint32 SurvivalHunterRefactored::GetOptimalAspect() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal aspect to apply for a survival hunter
    based on current combat state and abilities.
  description: The GetOptimalAspect method evaluates the current state of a survival
    hunter, including their target, available aspects, and combat situation, to determine
    which aspect provides the greatest benefit. This method is typically used in AI
    decision-making logic to dynamically select the most effective aspect for maximizing
    damage output or survivability. The returned value represents the spell ID of
    the chosen aspect, allowing the calling code to apply it directly to the hunter.
    This method may consider factors such as target type, distance, threat level,
    and existing buffs or debuffs when making its decision.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the spell ID of the optimal aspect to apply.
    Possible values include spell IDs for aspects like Aspect of the Viper, Aspect
    of the Hawk, or other applicable hunter aspects depending on the game state and
    logic implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "uint32 aspectId = hunter.GetOptimalAspect();\nif (aspectId != 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Apply the optimal aspect to the hunter\n    hunter.CastSpell(hunter,\
      \ aspectId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system and may be called frequently
    during combat. It's important to note that the actual implementation logic for
    determining 'optimal' can vary based on game updates or custom modifications.
    The method assumes the hunter object has valid target information and ability
    state.
  warnings: The returned spell ID should be validated before casting, as it may return
    0 if no optimal aspect is determined. This could happen in edge cases such as
    when the hunter has no valid targets or all aspects are on cooldown.
