documentation:
  brief: Scans the current map for rare and elite creatures within the behavior manager's
    defined search parameters.
  description: The ScanForRares method performs a comprehensive search of the active
    map for any rare or elite creature entries that match the behavior manager's configured
    criteria. It typically iterates through the creature spawn data, evaluates each
    creature's flags and faction status, and identifies those classified as rare or
    elite. This method is commonly used in AI behavior systems to dynamically locate
    high-value targets for quest completion, loot collection, or combat engagement.
    The scan operates within predefined distance thresholds and may consider creature
    state (alive, dead, despawned) and visibility conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage in Behavior AI
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_scanTimer <= diff)\n   \
      \ {\n        m_behaviorManager.ScanForRares();\n        m_scanTimer = 5000;\
      \ // Scan every 5 seconds\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_scanTimer -= diff;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during AI update cycles and may perform
    intensive map queries. It's recommended to limit scan frequency to avoid performance
    degradation in high-traffic areas. The behavior manager's internal state should
    be properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling ScanForRares without proper initialization of the behavior manager's
    search parameters can result in unexpected behavior or empty results. Avoid frequent
    calls in tight loops as it may cause excessive memory allocations or CPU usage.
