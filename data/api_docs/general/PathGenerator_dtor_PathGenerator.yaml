documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PathGenerator instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The PathGenerator destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of a PathGenerator object. This includes
    freeing internal path data structures, releasing any allocated buffers, and ensuring
    no memory leaks occur when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this destructor is typically
    invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when a PathGenerator object is destroyed,
    such as when it goes out of scope or when a smart pointer managing the object
    is reset. The destructor ensures that pathfinding data structures are properly
    cleaned up without leaving dangling pointers or leaked memory.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PathGenerator
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    PathGenerator generator;\n    // Use the generator...\n\
      \    // When function exits, generator is automatically destroyed\n    // and\
      \ destructor is called\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of PathGenerator
    code: 'PathGenerator* generator = new PathGenerator();

      // Use the generator...

      delete generator; // Destructor is called here

      // Note: In practice, prefer smart pointers like std::unique_ptr'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope or are explicitly deleted. It's important to note that PathGenerator
    objects should not be accessed after their destructor has been called, as this
    would result in undefined behavior. The destructor ensures proper cleanup of pathfinding
    resources but does not perform any additional logic beyond resource deallocation.
  warnings: Never manually call the destructor directly unless you're implementing
    custom memory management. Also, be cautious when using PathGenerator objects in
    multithreaded environments where destruction might occur while other threads are
    still accessing the object's data structures.
