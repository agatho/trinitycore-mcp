documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the combat event data is in a consistent and usable state
  description: The IsValid method checks if the CombatEvent object contains valid
    data and is in a consistent state for processing. This method typically verifies
    that required fields are populated, data types are correct, and the event can
    be safely used in combat calculations or logging. The validation ensures that
    the combat event hasn't been corrupted or improperly initialized, which could
    lead to incorrect combat behavior or system errors. This check is essential before
    performing any operations on the combat event, especially when dealing with events
    received from clients or loaded from database storage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat event data is valid and consistent, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the event has missing required
    fields, invalid data types, or other internal inconsistencies that would prevent
    proper processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "CombatEvent event;\n// ... populate event with data ...\nif (event.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Process the combat event\n    HandleCombatEvent(event);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Log invalid event or discard it\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid combat\
      \ event detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in combat processing pipeline
    code: "void ProcessCombatEvents(std::vector<CombatEvent>& events) {\n    for (auto&\
      \ event : events) {\n        if (!event.IsValid()) {\n            sLog->outError(\"\
      Skipping invalid combat event\");\n            continue;\n        }\n      \
      \  // Proceed with valid event processing\n        ApplyCombatEffect(event);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight validation check and should not be computationally
    expensive. It's recommended to call IsValid() before any significant processing
    of combat events to prevent potential crashes or incorrect game state changes.
    The exact validation criteria may vary depending on the specific implementation
    details of CombatEvent class members.
  warnings: Calling methods that depend on valid combat event data without first validating
    with IsValid() can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or incorrect combat calculations.
    Always validate before processing events received from external sources such as
    client packets or database records.
