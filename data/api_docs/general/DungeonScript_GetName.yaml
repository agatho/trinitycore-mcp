documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the dungeon script instance
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name associated with
    a DungeonScript instance. This name is typically used for identification purposes
    within the TrinityCore framework, particularly when managing or referencing specific
    dungeon scripts in the game world. The returned string is a constant character
    pointer that points to an internal memory location holding the script's name,
    ensuring it remains valid for the lifetime of the script object. This method does
    not modify any state and can be safely called from any thread context where the
    script instance is accessible.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const char pointer pointing to the null-terminated string representing
    the dungeon script's name. The returned value should not be modified or freed
    by the caller as it points to internal memory managed by the script object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DungeonScript* script = sObjectMgr->GetDungeonScript("MyDungeonScript");

      const char* name = script->GetName();

      printf("Dungeon Script Name: %s\n", name);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Script Name in Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnter(Player* player) override\n{\n    const char* scriptName\
      \ = GetName();\n    if (strcmp(scriptName, \"InstanceScript\") == 0)\n    {\n\
      \        // Handle specific instance script logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string is managed internally by the DungeonScript object and
    must not be freed or modified by the caller. The method is thread-safe as long
    as the script object itself is not being concurrently modified.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or modify the returned pointer, as it points to
    internal memory that may be deallocated when the script object is destroyed. Ensure
    the script object remains valid during the lifetime of any references to its name.
