documentation:
  brief: Updates the cache of known flight paths for the player
  description: The UpdateKnownPathsCache method refreshes the internal cache of flight
    paths that are known to the player character. This typically occurs when a player
    discovers new flight paths, learns them through quest completion or trainer interaction,
    or when the game state changes in a way that affects flight path availability.
    The method ensures that the FlightMasterManager maintains an up-to-date list of
    accessible flight paths for the current player, which is essential for proper
    flight master functionality and UI display. This cache update is usually triggered
    automatically by the game engine during appropriate events such as zone transitions
    or quest state changes.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FlightMasterManager* fm = player->GetMotionMaster();

      fm->UpdateKnownPathsCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    state changes rather than directly by external code. It may involve database operations
    to persist updated flight path knowledge for the player.
