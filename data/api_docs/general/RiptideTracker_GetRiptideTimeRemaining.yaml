  class: RiptideTracker
  method: GetRiptideTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 RiptideTracker::GetRiptideTimeRemaining(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time remaining for a Riptide effect on a specified unit.
  description: The GetRiptideTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration in milliseconds
    that a Riptide spell effect will remain active on a target unit. This method is
    typically used by Shaman class abilities to determine how much time is left before
    the Riptide buff expires. The method takes a unit GUID as input and returns the
    remaining time for that specific Riptide application. It's important to note that
    this method only works with valid unit GUIDs that have an active Riptide effect,
    otherwise it may return 0 or an undefined value.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the target unit that has a Riptide
      effect applied. This should be a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  returns: Returns the time remaining in milliseconds for the Riptide effect on the
    specified unit. If no Riptide effect is active on the unit, this method may return
    0 or an undefined value.
  examples:
  - title: Check Riptide Time Remaining
    code: "uint32 timeRemaining = riptideTracker->GetRiptideTimeRemaining(playerGuid);\n\
      if (timeRemaining > 0)\n{\n    // Riptide is still active\n    uint32 secondsRemaining\
      \ = timeRemaining / 1000;\n    // Use secondsRemaining for UI updates or other\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine if Riptide Needs Refreshing
    code: "uint32 timeRemaining = riptideTracker->GetRiptideTimeRemaining(targetGuid);\n\
      if (timeRemaining < 3000) // Less than 3 seconds remaining\n{\n    // Consider\
      \ refreshing the Riptide spell\n    // This is common in Shaman rotation logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the RiptideTracker has been properly initialized
    and maintains a mapping of unit GUIDs to their active Riptide effects. The implementation
    likely uses internal data structures such as maps or lists to track active effects.
    Performance is generally O(1) for lookups assuming proper hash table implementation.
  warnings: This method may return undefined results if called with an invalid GUID
    or a GUID that does not have an active Riptide effect. Always validate the returned
    value before using it in time-sensitive logic. In some cases, this method might
    return 0 even when an effect is present, so consider implementing additional checks
    for effect validity.
