  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: DemonHunterAI
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::DemonHunterAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Demon Hunter AI instance with the specified bot reference.
  description: The DemonHunterAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a Demon
    Hunter class character within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up internal
    state and references required for the AI to function properly, including linking
    to the provided bot instance. The initialization process typically involves setting
    up action queues, threat management systems, and class-specific ability tracking.
    This constructor is called during the creation of AI-controlled Demon Hunter units,
    such as those used in player bots or scripted encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot instance that this AI will control. Must be a
      valid pointer to a Demon Hunter character object. The parameter cannot be null
      or invalid, as it's essential for all AI operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DemonHunterAI Initialization
    code: DemonHunterAI* ai = new DemonHunterAI(&myBot);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing AI with Bot Reference
    code: 'Player* playerBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid Demon Hunter bot

      DemonHunterAI* demonHunterAI = new DemonHunterAI(reinterpret_cast<int*>(&playerBot));

      // The AI will now control the Demon Hunter bot instance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes that the provided bot parameter is already properly
    initialized and represents a valid Demon Hunter character. The AI system relies
    on the bot's state to make decisions, so any invalid or uninitialized bot reference
    will lead to undefined behavior. Consider using smart pointers or reference counting
    for better memory management in complex scenarios.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid bot reference to this constructor
    will result in crashes or unpredictable behavior. Ensure that the bot parameter
    points to a fully constructed Demon Hunter character object before calling this
    constructor. This method does not perform validation on the input parameter, so
    developers must ensure correctness externally.
