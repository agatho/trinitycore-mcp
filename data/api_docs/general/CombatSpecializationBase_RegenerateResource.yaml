  method: RegenerateResource
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::RegenerateResource(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Regenerates player resource based on elapsed time and specialization mechanics.
  description: The RegenerateResource method handles the automatic regeneration of
    a player's resource (such as mana, rage, or energy) over time. It is typically
    called during combat updates or periodic game ticks to apply resource regeneration
    effects based on the player's current combat specialization and game state. The
    method processes the time difference (diff) to determine how much resource should
    be regenerated, taking into account factors like regeneration rates, specialization
    bonuses, and any active buffs or debuffs that may affect resource recovery.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since the last resource regeneration
      update. This value is used to calculate how much resource should be regenerated
      based on the player's current regeneration rate.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Regeneration Call
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) {\n    // Example of calling RegenerateResource\
      \ in a combat update loop\n    if (m_player && m_player->IsInCombat()) {\n \
      \       m_player->GetCombatSpecialization()->RegenerateResource(diff);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Update Loop
    code: "void Player::Update(uint32 diff) {\n    // Perform regular updates\n  \
      \  Unit::Update(diff);\n    \n    // Regenerate resources if in combat\n   \
      \ if (IsInCombat()) {\n        if (GetCombatSpecialization()) {\n          \
      \  GetCombatSpecialization()->RegenerateResource(diff);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the game's core update loop during combat
    or periodic ticks. The regeneration rate and behavior are influenced by the player's
    current specialization, equipped items, and active auras. It's important to ensure
    that this method is only called when appropriate (e.g., during combat) to avoid
    unnecessary processing.
  warnings: Calling RegenerateResource outside of a valid combat context may lead
    to incorrect resource regeneration or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the player
    object and specialization are valid before invoking this method.
