  class: MoveToPositionAction
  method: IsUseful
  signature: bool MoveToPositionAction::IsUseful(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the MoveToPosition action is currently useful for the
    bot AI.
  description: The IsUseful method evaluates if the MoveToPositionAction should be
    considered for execution by the bot's AI. It typically checks conditions such
    as whether the target position is valid, if the bot is already at or near the
    destination, or if there are any obstacles preventing movement. This method helps
    prevent unnecessary or redundant movement actions in the AI decision-making process.
    The evaluation is performed within the context of a BotAI instance which provides
    access to the bot's current state and environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the MoveToPosition action is deemed useful (i.e., should
    be executed), false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the AI should
    consider executing this movement action based on current conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "bool useful = moveToPositionAction.IsUseful(ai);\nif (useful) {\n    //\
      \ Execute movement logic\n    ai->GetBot()->MoveTo(targetPosition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle before
    selecting actions. It's important to note that IsUseful may perform checks on
    the bot's current position, target validity, and environmental factors such as
    obstacles or pathfinding status.
