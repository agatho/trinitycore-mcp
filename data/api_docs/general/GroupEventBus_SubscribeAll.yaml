  class: GroupEventBus
  method: SubscribeAll
  signature: bool GroupEventBus::SubscribeAll(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all group events in the GroupEventBus.
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a BotAI subscriber to receive notifications
    for all group-related events managed by the GroupEventBus. This allows the bot
    to react to various group activities such as member joins, leaves, role changes,
    and other group dynamics without needing to manually subscribe to each individual
    event type. The method returns true if the subscription was successful, or false
    if the subscriber was already registered or if there were issues during registration.
    This is typically used in AI systems where bots need comprehensive awareness of
    group state changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotAI subscriber was successfully added to all event
    subscriptions, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the
    subscriber was already registered or that an internal error occurred during subscription.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Subscription Example
    code: "BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();\nbool success = groupEventBus->SubscribeAll(myBot);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot is now subscribed to all group events\n    printf(\"\
      Bot successfully subscribed to all group events\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Subscription\
      \ failed\n    printf(\"Failed to subscribe bot to group events\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely internally iterates through all known event types and
    registers the subscriber with each one. It may be computationally expensive if
    there are many event types, so it should be called sparingly during initialization
    or when necessary. The GroupEventBus must be properly initialized before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Calling SubscribeAll on an already subscribed BotAI instance may result
    in duplicate subscriptions or undefined behavior. Always ensure proper cleanup
    of subscriptions before re-subscribing. This method does not validate whether
    the BotAI instance is valid or properly initialized, so calling it with a null
    pointer will likely cause crashes.
