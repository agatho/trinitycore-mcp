  method: ChannelMgr
  signature: void ChannelMgr::ChannelMgr(int team)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new channel manager instance for the specified team
  description: The ChannelMgr constructor initializes a new channel manager object
    that handles communication channels for players on a specific team. This method
    sets up internal data structures and state necessary for managing chat channels,
    guild channels, and other team-based communication features within the TrinityCore
    framework. The team parameter determines which faction's channels this manager
    will handle, typically 0 for Alliance or 1 for Horde. This constructor is usually
    called internally by the core system when a new channel manager is needed for
    player communications.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) that this channel
      manager will handle. This parameter determines which faction's channels and
      communication rules apply to the manager instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Channel Manager for Alliance
    code: ChannelMgr* allianceChannelMgr = new ChannelMgr(0); // Initialize for Alliance
      team
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Channel Manager for Horde
    code: ChannelMgr* hordeChannelMgr = new ChannelMgr(1); // Initialize for Horde
      team
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by modders or developers.
    It's usually invoked internally by the TrinityCore core system when managing player
    communication channels. The channel manager maintains internal lists of active
    channels and handles channel creation, destruction, and user management.
  warnings: Do not instantiate ChannelMgr objects manually unless you understand the
    complete TrinityCore communication subsystem. Incorrect usage can lead to memory
    leaks or communication failures in player channels.
