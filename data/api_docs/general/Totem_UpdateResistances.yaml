  class: Totem
  method: UpdateResistances
  signature: void Totem::UpdateResistances(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the resistances of the totem based on the provided parameter.
  description: The UpdateResistances method adjusts the elemental resistances of a
    totem, typically in response to changes in the totem's owner's stats or equipment.
    This method is crucial for maintaining accurate resistance values that affect
    how the totem interacts with magical attacks. It ensures that the totem's defensive
    capabilities remain aligned with the current game state and player conditions.
    The method likely recalculates resistance values based on the input parameter,
    which may represent a stat modifier, spell effect, or other influencing factor.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that influences how resistances are updated.
      This could represent a stat modifier, spell level, or resistance adjustment
      value. The exact meaning depends on the context in which this method is called.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Totem Resistances with Stat Modifier
    code: 'int statModifier = 15;

      totem->UpdateResistances(statModifier);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Resistance Change from Spell Effect
    code: 'int spellEffect = 20;

      totem->UpdateResistances(spellEffect);

      // This would update the totem''s elemental resistances based on the spell effect
      value'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the game engine when a totem's
    owner gains or loses stat modifiers, equipment changes, or when spell effects
    are applied. It may also be invoked during periodic updates or when specific conditions
    are met in combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the parameter value passed to this method is within valid
    ranges to prevent unexpected behavior. Improper values could lead to incorrect
    resistance calculations or potential game balance issues.
