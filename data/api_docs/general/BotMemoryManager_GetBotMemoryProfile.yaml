  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: GetBotMemoryProfile
  signature: BotMemoryProfile BotMemoryManager::GetBotMemoryProfile(uint32_t botGuid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the memory profile associated with a specific bot GUID from the
    memory manager.
  description: The GetBotMemoryProfile method retrieves a BotMemoryProfile object
    that contains all relevant memory data for a specified bot identified by its unique
    GUID. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore AI framework to access
    stored information about bot behavior, decisions, and state. The returned profile
    may include data such as recent actions, target preferences, or other contextual
    memory that helps maintain consistent bot behavior across sessions. The method
    assumes that a valid bot with the provided GUID exists in the system's memory
    management structure.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose memory profile is to
      be retrieved. Must correspond to an existing bot within the system.
  returns: A BotMemoryProfile object containing all stored memory data for the specified
    bot. Returns an empty or default profile if no matching bot is found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Memory Profile for a Specific Bot
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotMemoryProfile profile = memoryManager.GetBotMemoryProfile(botGuid);

      // Use profile data to analyze or modify bot behavior

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe if the underlying memory manager implementation
    supports concurrent access. It may involve internal lookups or caching mechanisms
    that could affect performance when called frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an actual bot in the system;
    otherwise, the returned profile might be invalid or empty. Avoid calling this
    method with invalid GUIDs to prevent potential undefined behavior.
