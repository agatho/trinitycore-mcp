documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player will receive resurrection sickness upon death.
  description: The WillReceiveResurrectionSickness method checks if a player is currently
    subject to resurrection sickness when they die. This mechanic applies in certain
    game scenarios, such as when a player dies in a battleground or arena, or when
    specific conditions are met that prevent the normal resurrection sickness from
    being avoided. The method returns true if the player will experience resurrection
    sickness upon death, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for implementing
    proper game mechanics related to player death and resurrection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player will receive resurrection sickness upon death,
    false if they will not.
  examples:
  - title: Check Resurrection Sickness Status
    code: "if (player->GetDeathRecoveryManager()->WillReceiveResurrectionSickness())\
      \ {\n    // Player will receive resurrection sickness\n    SendNotification(\"\
      You will suffer from resurrection sickness.\");\n} else {\n    // Player will\
      \ not receive resurrection sickness\n    SendNotification(\"You will not suffer\
      \ from resurrection sickness.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with death handling and resurrection
    logic. It may be affected by various game states, such as being in a battleground,
    arena, or under certain buff/debuff effects that modify resurrection sickness
    behavior.
  warnings: The result of this method can change dynamically based on the player's
    current game state, so calling it at different points during gameplay may return
    different values. Always verify the current state before making decisions based
    on its return value.
