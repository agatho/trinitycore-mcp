    * bot, Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cached position of a target unit for a bot player.
  description: The GetCachedPosition method retrieves a previously stored or computed
    position for a specified target unit relative to a bot player. This method is
    typically used in AI behavior systems where bots need to maintain knowledge of
    target locations over time, avoiding repeated expensive calculations. The returned
    CachedPosition may contain positional data such as coordinates and orientation,
    which can be used for movement decisions, combat positioning, or pathfinding.
    The method returns an std::optional, indicating whether valid cached data exists
    for the given bot and target combination.
  parameters: []
  returns: An std::optional<CachedPosition> containing the cached position data if
    available; otherwise, returns std::nullopt if no cache entry exists or the data
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve cached target position
    code: "if (auto cachedPos = strategy->GetCachedPosition(bot, target); cachedPos.has_value())\
      \ {\n    // Use cached position for movement or decision making\n    Position\
      \ pos = cachedPos->GetPosition();\n    // Proceed with AI logic using pos\n\
      } else {\n    // No cached data available, compute new position\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a caching strategy designed to optimize performance
    in AI systems by reducing redundant computations. It assumes that the PositionStrategyBase
    implementation maintains internal state or uses external storage for caching logic.
    The validity and lifetime of cached positions depend on how the underlying system
    manages cache invalidation.
  warnings: Using this method without checking for std::nullopt may lead to undefined
    behavior if no cached data exists. Additionally, relying on outdated cached positions
    can cause incorrect AI decisions; ensure proper cache invalidation mechanisms
    are in place.
