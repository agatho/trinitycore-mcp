  class: Value
  method: Set
  signature: void Value::Set(BotAI * ai, const std::any & value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the value of a bot AI variable to the provided std::any value.
  description: The Value::Set method assigns a new value to a bot AI variable, allowing
    dynamic modification of bot behavior parameters during runtime. This method accepts
    a BotAI pointer and a std::any value, which can hold any type of data. The implementation
    likely stores this value internally for later retrieval by other methods in the
    AI system. This functionality is crucial for enabling bots to adapt their behavior
    based on changing game conditions or external inputs.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that owns this value. Used to associate
      the value with a specific bot's context.
  - name: value
    description: The new value to assign, wrapped in std::any. Can hold any type of
      data, enabling flexible storage of different parameter types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a simple integer value
    code: 'BotAI* bot = ...;

      int healthThreshold = 30;

      value.Set(bot, std::any(healthThreshold));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a string value for bot behavior
    code: 'BotAI* bot = ...;

      std::string targetName = "Goblin Miner";

      value.Set(bot, std::any(targetName));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs type erasure through std::any, which may introduce
    performance overhead during value assignment. The internal storage mechanism should
    be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded bot environments.
  warnings: Be cautious when using std::any with non-copyable types as it may cause
    runtime errors. Ensure that the BotAI pointer is valid before calling this method
    to prevent undefined behavior.
