  brief: Updates all active mirror timer effects on the player
  description: The UpdateMirrorTimers method is responsible for updating the state
    and visual display of all active mirror timer effects currently applied to the
    player. These timers typically represent debuffs or buffs that have a time-based
    component, such as those from abilities like Mirror Image, Fear, or other duration-based
    effects. The method ensures that the client's UI accurately reflects the remaining
    time for each active timer and handles any necessary visual updates or notifications.
    This function is generally called internally by the core when timer states change
    or during periodic updates to maintain synchronization between server-side state
    and client-side display.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within a spell effect
    code: "void MySpellEffect(Player* player)\n{\n    // Apply a mirror timer effect\n\
      \    player->AddMirrorTimer(MIRROR_TIMER_FEAR, 5000);\n    \n    // Update the\
      \ UI to reflect the new timer\n    player->UpdateMirrorTimers();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically iterates through all active mirror timers stored in
    the player's state and sends appropriate update packets to the client. It may
    be called automatically by the core during periodic updates or manually when timer
    states change. The implementation likely involves checking for expired timers
    and removing them from the active list.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can cause
    unnecessary network traffic and performance degradation. It should only be invoked
    when timer states have actually changed, not on every tick.
