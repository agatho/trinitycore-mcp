  class: Unit
  method: GetCollisionHeight
  signature: float Unit::GetCollisionHeight() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the collision height of the unit for use in movement calculations.
  description: The GetCollisionHeight method retrieves the collision height of a Unit
    object, which represents the vertical distance from the ground to the top of the
    unit's bounding box. This value is crucial for determining whether a unit can
    pass through certain areas or interact with terrain and objects in World of Warcraft.
    The method is used primarily in pathfinding and movement calculations to ensure
    accurate positioning and collision detection. It typically returns a float value
    representing the height in yards, which may vary based on the unit's model size
    and orientation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the collision height of the unit in
    yards. This value is used for movement calculations and determines whether the
    unit can pass through certain areas or interact with terrain.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float height = unit->GetCollisionHeight();\n// Use height in movement calculations\n\
      if (height > 0.5f) {\n    // Unit can pass through narrow spaces\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    functions to determine whether a unit can navigate through specific terrain or
    objects. Performance considerations include the fact that this value may be cached
    for efficiency, though it's not guaranteed.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining whether a unit can pass
    through narrow spaces without considering other factors like bounding box dimensions
    and movement restrictions. The value returned may vary based on unit's model size
    and orientation.
