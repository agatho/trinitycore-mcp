  signature: int TransmogIllusionEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with a transmogrification illusion entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags defined for a specific transmogrification illusion entry. These flags
    typically control various behaviors and restrictions related to how the illusion
    can be applied, such as whether it's bindable, account-bound, or usable only by
    certain classes. The returned value is a combination of predefined flag constants
    that determine the illusion's properties within the game's transmogrification
    system. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe for repeated
    calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flags bitmask for this transmogrification
    illusion entry. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific flag
    that defines properties like binding rules, usability conditions, or other restrictions.
    A value of 0 indicates no special flags are set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TransmogIllusionEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetTransmogIllusionEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & TRANSMOG_FLAG_BIND_ON_ACQUIRE)\n\
      \        printf(\"This illusion binds when acquired.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Flags
    code: "TransmogIllusionEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetTransmogIllusionEntry(67890);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    bool isAccountBound =\
      \ (flags & TRANSMOG_FLAG_ACCOUNT_BOUND) != 0;\n    bool isClassRestricted =\
      \ (flags & TRANSMOG_FLAG_CLASS_RESTRICTED) != 0;\n    printf(\"Is account bound:\
      \ %s, Class restricted: %s\\n\", \n           isAccountBound ? \"true\" : \"\
      false\",\n           isClassRestricted ? \"true\" : \"false\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are defined in the TrinityCore transmogrification
    system and may vary between different versions of the core. Developers should
    consult the current implementation or documentation to understand the meaning
    of each flag bit. This method is typically used during item validation, UI display
    logic, or when determining if a player can apply a specific illusion to their
    gear.
  warnings: Be aware that flag values are not guaranteed to be stable across different
    TrinityCore versions. Always verify flag meanings against the current codebase.
    Also, since this is a const method, it should only be used for reading data and
    not modifying internal state.
