  class: InvalidNameAppend
  method: Append
  signature: void InvalidNameAppend::Append(WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify &
    param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Appends invalid name data to a channel notification packet for transmission
    to clients.
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with invalid name-related data. This method is typically used within the
    TrinityCore framework to communicate channel-related errors or status updates
    to connected clients. It handles the serialization of invalid name information
    into the appropriate packet structure, ensuring that client applications receive
    proper feedback about channel operations involving invalid names. The method operates
    on a const object and modifies the provided packet parameter in-place.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet that will
      be populated with invalid name data. This packet is modified in-place to include
      the relevant channel notification information.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InvalidNameAppend append;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      append.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal channel management system in TrinityCore.
    It's typically invoked when processing channel-related commands or events that
    involve invalid name validation. The method assumes the packet parameter is properly
    initialized and ready to receive data.
  warnings: Ensure the provided packet parameter is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method, as it directly modifies the packet's internal data
    structures without performing any safety checks.
