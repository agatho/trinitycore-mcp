documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the combat role associated with the combat specialization.
  description: The GetCombatRole method returns the CombatRole enumeration value that
    represents the primary role of this combat specialization. This role typically
    defines how the specialization is intended to function in combat, such as being
    a tank, healer, or damage dealer. The method provides access to the core classification
    of the specialization without requiring additional computations or state checks.
    It is commonly used by the game engine to determine appropriate behavior, abilities,
    and resource management for units with this specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CombatRole enumeration value indicating the primary combat role of this
    specialization. Possible values include roles such as TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE_DEALER,
    or other specialized roles defined in the game's combat system. The method will
    always return a valid CombatRole value for valid combat specializations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nCombatRole\
      \ role = spec->GetCombatRole();\nif (role == CombatRole::DAMAGE_DEALER)\n{\n\
      \    // Handle damage dealer specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role-Based Ability Selection
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = unit->GetCombatSpecialization();\nCombatRole\
      \ role = spec->GetCombatRole();\nswitch (role)\n{\n    case CombatRole::TANK:\n\
      \        // Apply tank-specific abilities\n        break;\n    case CombatRole::HEALER:\n\
      \        // Apply healer-specific abilities\n        break;\n    case CombatRole::DAMAGE_DEALER:\n\
      \        // Apply damage dealer abilities\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not modify any internal state.
    It should be safe to call from any thread context where the CombatSpecializationBase
    object is accessible. The returned CombatRole value is determined at specialization
    initialization and remains constant throughout the object's lifetime.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatSpecializationBase object is valid before calling
    this method, as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    This method assumes that the specialization has been properly initialized with
    a valid combat role.
