documentation:
  brief: Performs self-healing for a restoration shaman character
  description: The HandleSelfHealing method implements the core logic for a restoration
    shaman to apply healing to themselves. This method typically checks if the shaman
    has sufficient mana, evaluates available healing spells or abilities, and executes
    the appropriate healing action. It is designed to be called during combat or non-combat
    scenarios where self-healing is required. The method may also consider factors
    such as current health percentage, mana levels, and spell cooldowns before performing
    the healing action.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the self-healing action was successfully executed, false
    otherwise. The method returns false when preconditions are not met, such as insufficient
    mana or when no valid healing ability is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Self-Healing Usage
    code: "if (shaman->HandleSelfHealing()) {\n    // Healing was applied successfully\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Shaman healed themselves\");\n} else {\n    // Healing\
      \ failed for some reason\n    sLog->outString(\"Shaman could not heal themselves\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of an AI decision-making loop in
    the TrinityCore framework. It assumes that the shaman object has valid references
    to its spell system and player state. The implementation may vary based on the
    specific restoration shaman build or class specialization.
  warnings: Ensure the shaman character has a valid player instance before calling
    this method, as it relies on player state information. Failure to check preconditions
    might lead to unexpected behavior or errors during healing execution.
