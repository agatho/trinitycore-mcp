  method: SelectBestDefensive
  signature: uint32 DefensiveBehaviorManager::SelectBestDefensive(DefensivePriority
    priority) const
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the best defensive ability based on the specified priority
    level.
  description: The SelectBestDefensive method evaluates available defensive abilities
    within the DefensiveBehaviorManager and determines the most appropriate one to
    use according to the given DefensivePriority. This method is typically used in
    AI-driven NPC behavior to dynamically select the most effective defensive action
    during combat scenarios. The selection process considers factors such as threat
    level, health status, and ability cooldowns. It returns a unique identifier (likely
    an ability ID or spell ID) that represents the chosen defensive action. The method
    does not modify any internal state and is designed to be called repeatedly without
    side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the identifier of the selected defensive
    ability. This identifier typically corresponds to a spell or ability ID used by
    the game engine to execute the chosen defensive action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "uint32 bestDefensive = defensiveManager.SelectBestDefensive(DEFENSIVE_PRIORITY_HIGH);\n\
      if (bestDefensive != 0)\n{\n    // Execute the selected defensive ability\n\
      \    unit->CastSpell(unit, bestDefensive, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger defensive behavior system and assumes that
    defensive abilities have been properly initialized and registered with the DefensiveBehaviorManager.
    The actual selection algorithm may vary based on implementation details but generally
    prioritizes abilities that provide maximum protection under current combat conditions.
