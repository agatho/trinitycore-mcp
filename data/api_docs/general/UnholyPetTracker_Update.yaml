  class: UnholyPetTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void UnholyPetTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the unholy pet tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in UnholyPetTracker is responsible for maintaining
    and synchronizing the state of an unholy pet associated with a player bot. This
    method typically handles logic related to pet behavior, positioning, targeting,
    and interaction within the context of a death knight's unholy specialization.
    It ensures that the pet's actions are aligned with the bot's current strategy
    and game state. The method may also manage pet cooldowns, spell usage, and tactical
    decisions based on the player's current situation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose unholy pet
      state needs to be updated. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid player instance with an active unholy pet.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid player bot

      UnholyPetTracker tracker;

      tracker.Update(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update in Bot AI Loop
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    if (player && player->GetClass() == CLASS_DEATH_KNIGHT)\n\
      \    {\n        UnholyPetTracker tracker;\n        tracker.Update(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's AI update cycle. It may
    perform operations that involve checking pet health, positioning, targeting enemies,
    and executing appropriate spells or abilities based on the current combat situation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and represents
    a death knight with an active unholy pet. Passing a null or invalid pointer can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
