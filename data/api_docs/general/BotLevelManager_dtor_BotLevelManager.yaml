documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotLevelManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotLevelManager class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This method ensures
    proper cleanup of any internal data structures, such as bot level configurations,
    cached values, or references to game objects. It is automatically invoked when
    a BotLevelManager instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor
    does not take any parameters and performs no return operations. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this method helps maintain memory efficiency by preventing
    resource leaks when bot level management components are no longer needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotLevelManager instance
    code: 'BotLevelManager* manager = new BotLevelManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~BotLevelManager()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope or are deleted. Ensure that no other threads are accessing the
    manager instance during destruction to avoid race conditions.
