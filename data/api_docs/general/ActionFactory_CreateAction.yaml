documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new Action instance by name
  description: The CreateAction method is a factory function that instantiates and
    returns a new Action object based on the provided action name. This method serves
    as the primary interface for creating various types of actions within the TrinityCore
    AI system. The returned Action object is wrapped in a std::shared_ptr for automatic
    memory management. The method typically looks up the action type in an internal
    registry or factory map and constructs the appropriate derived Action class. This
    allows for dynamic creation of different action behaviors without direct instantiation,
    supporting extensibility and modularity in AI decision-making systems.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The string identifier that specifies which type of Action to create.
      This name is used to look up the corresponding action factory or registration
      in the system.
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<Action> pointing to the newly created Action instance,
    or a null pointer if no matching action type could be found for the given name.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Creation
    code: "auto action = ActionFactory::CreateAction(\"MoveToTarget\");\nif (action)\n\
      {\n    // Use the created action\n    action->Execute();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling for Unknown Actions
    code: "auto action = ActionFactory::CreateAction(\"InvalidActionName\");\nif (!action)\n\
      {\n    // Handle case where action type is not recognized\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to create action: InvalidActionName\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on an internal registry or factory mapping that must be
    populated with valid action types before CreateAction can successfully instantiate
    them. The returned shared_ptr ensures automatic memory management and prevents
    memory leaks, but developers should be aware of potential circular references
    in complex AI hierarchies.
  warnings: Calling this method with an unrecognized action name will likely return
    a null pointer, which must be checked to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, if
    multiple threads access the factory simultaneously, thread safety considerations
    should be taken into account for the internal registry operations.
