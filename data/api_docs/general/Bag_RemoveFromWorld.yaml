  method: RemoveFromWorld
  signature: void Bag::RemoveFromWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the bag object from the game world, making it no longer visible or
    interactable by players.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method removes a Bag object from the active game
    world state. This operation typically occurs when a bag is being destroyed, sold,
    or moved out of a player's inventory. The method ensures that the bag is properly
    unlinked from any world objects, clears its associated data structures, and updates
    the game state accordingly. It is commonly called during item management operations
    such as when a player drops a bag, sells it, or when the bag's contents are fully
    consumed. This method does not delete the object from memory but rather removes
    it from the world's active object list.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a Bag from World
    code: "Bag* myBag = player->GetBag(0);\nif (myBag)\n{\n    myBag->RemoveFromWorld();\n\
      \    // The bag is now removed from the world and no longer accessible\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying a Bag object to ensure proper
    cleanup of game state. It does not immediately delete the object but rather removes
    it from active world interaction. The bag's GUID remains valid for reference purposes
    until the object is fully destroyed.
  warnings: Calling RemoveFromWorld on a bag that has already been removed or is in
    an invalid state may cause undefined behavior. Always verify the bag's validity
    before calling this method.
