documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new FormationConfig object with default settings.
  description: The FormationConfig constructor initializes a new instance of the FormationConfig
    class, setting up default values for formation-related parameters. This method
    is typically called when creating a new formation configuration object to define
    how units should position themselves in a group or formation. The initialization
    process ensures that all internal data members are properly set to their default
    states, allowing the formation system to function correctly with sensible defaults.
    No specific preconditions are required for this constructor, as it handles its
    own initialization logic.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new FormationConfig instance
    code: 'FormationConfig config;

      // config is now initialized with default formation settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any dynamic memory allocation or external
    resource initialization. It simply sets up the internal state of the object to
    default values. The FormationConfig class likely contains member variables that
    store formation parameters such as spacing, orientation, and positioning rules.
