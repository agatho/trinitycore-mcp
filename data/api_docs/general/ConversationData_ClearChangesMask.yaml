documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the conversation data object.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a ConversationData instance. This operation is typically used to indicate
    that all previously modified fields have been synchronized or processed, effectively
    marking the conversation data as clean. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this method helps manage state tracking for dynamic conversations
    and quest interactions where field modifications need to be monitored and cleared
    after processing.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ConversationData* conversation = new ConversationData();

      // ... modify conversation fields ...

      conversation->ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after processing changes to avoid redundant
    updates. It's commonly used in conjunction with change detection mechanisms within
    the TrinityCore framework.
