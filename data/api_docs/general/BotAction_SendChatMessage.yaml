    uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a chat message from a bot with specified timestamp
  description: The SendChatMessage method allows a bot to transmit a text message
    to the game world's chat system. This method is typically used in AI-driven bot
    systems within TrinityCore to enable bots to communicate with players or other
    bots. The method accepts a bot identifier, message content, and a timestamp to
    control when the message should appear in chat. The return value is the BotAction
    instance itself, enabling method chaining for fluent API usage. This functionality
    is particularly useful for creating interactive bot behaviors such as greeting
    players, announcing events, or providing game information.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Identifier for the bot that will send the message. This typically
      corresponds to a unique bot instance or character ID within the TrinityCore
      system.
  - name: message
    description: The text content of the chat message to be sent. This can include
      any valid string data, though it should be kept within reasonable length limits
      for proper display in game chat.
  - name: timestamp
    description: Unix timestamp indicating when the message should appear in chat.
      This allows for precise control over message timing and can be used to simulate
      realistic chat behavior or synchronize messages with other events.
  returns: Returns a reference to the BotAction instance, enabling method chaining
    for fluent API usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chat Message
    code: 'BotAction action;

      action.SendChatMessage(12345, "Hello, World!", time(nullptr));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Fluent API Usage
    code: "BotAction()\n  .SendChatMessage(12345, \"Welcome to our server!\", time(nullptr))\n\
      \  .SendChatMessage(12345, \"Have a great day!\", time(nullptr) + 10);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the TrinityCore bot framework and requires that
    the specified bot exists and is properly initialized. The timestamp parameter
    can be used to schedule messages in the future or create historical chat sequences.
    Implementation details may vary based on the specific bot AI system being used.
  warnings: Ensure that bot identifiers are valid and that messages don't exceed game
    chat limits. Sending too many messages rapidly may result in rate limiting or
    message suppression by the game server.
