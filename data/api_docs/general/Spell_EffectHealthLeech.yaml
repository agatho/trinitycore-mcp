  brief: Applies health leech effect to target
  description: This method implements the health leech mechanic where a spell can
    drain health from targets and transfer it to the caster. It typically occurs during
    spell effects that involve draining health from enemies, such as life tap or other
    damage-dealing spells with health leech components. The method handles the logic
    for determining how much health is transferred and ensures proper application
    of the leech effect.

  - title: Basic Health Leech Implementation
    code: "void Spell::EffectHealthLeech()\n{\n    // Implementation logic here\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely requires proper target selection and validation to ensure
    health leech works correctly. Performance considerations include ensuring the
    leech effect doesn't cause excessive resource consumption or balance issues.
  warnings: Improper implementation may lead to unbalanced gameplay mechanics where
    players can exploit health leech effects for excessive healing, potentially disrupting
    game balance.
