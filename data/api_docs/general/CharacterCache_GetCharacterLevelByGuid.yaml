documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the level of a character given their unique identifier (GUID) from
    the character cache.
  description: The GetCharacterLevelByGuid method fetches the current level of a player
    character using their globally unique identifier (GUID). This method operates
    on cached character data, which is typically populated during server startup or
    when a character logs in. The method assumes that the GUID corresponds to an existing
    character in the cache and will return 0 if the character is not found. It's commonly
    used in game logic where character level information is needed without performing
    expensive database queries. This method is thread-safe as it operates on cached
    data and does not modify any persistent state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the character's level. If the GUID is
    not found in the cache, it returns 0, indicating an invalid or non-existent character.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Character Level
    code: "uint8 level = CharacterCache::GetCharacterLevelByGuid(12345);\nif (level\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Character is at level \" << static_cast<int>(level)\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"Character not found in cache\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Level for Game Logic Decision
    code: "int playerGuid = 54321;\nuint8 playerLevel = CharacterCache::GetCharacterLevelByGuid(playerGuid);\n\
      if (playerLevel >= 10)\n{\n    // Allow access to higher-level content\n   \
      \ player->SendPacket(SendHighLevelContent());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Restrict access\
      \ or show level-up message\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You must reach level\
      \ 10 to access this area.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the character cache being properly populated. If called
    before characters are loaded into the cache, it will return 0 for all GUIDs. The
    cache is typically updated when players log in or when data is refreshed from
    the database. This method does not perform any database queries and should be
    fast to execute.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only works with cached character data. If a
    character has logged in recently but hasn't been added to the cache yet, this
    method will return 0 for their GUID. Also, using this method on invalid or non-existent
    GUIDs will always return 0, so callers should validate GUIDs before calling if
    necessary.
