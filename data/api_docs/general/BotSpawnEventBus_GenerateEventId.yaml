  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: GenerateEventId
  signature: uint64 BotSpawnEventBus::GenerateEventId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique 64-bit identifier for bot spawn events within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The GenerateEventId method creates and returns a globally unique identifier
    (GUID) used to track and manage bot spawn events in the World of Warcraft server
    environment. This identifier is typically employed by the BotSpawnEventBus to
    distinguish between different instances of bot spawning operations, ensuring proper
    event handling and synchronization across multiple threads or systems. The generated
    ID is designed to be collision-resistant and suitable for use in distributed systems
    where uniqueness across time and space is critical. The method does not require
    any input parameters and will always produce a valid 64-bit unsigned integer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A unique 64-bit unsigned integer (uint64) representing the identifier for
    a bot spawn event. This value is guaranteed to be unique within the scope of the
    system's operational lifetime and can be used to correlate related events or track
    specific spawn operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint64 eventId = botSpawnEventBus.GenerateEventId();

      // Use eventId to track a new bot spawn event

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Generated event ID: %llu", eventId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Event Tracking
    code: 'uint64 eventId = botSpawnEventBus.GenerateEventId();

      BotSpawnEvent* event = new BotSpawnEvent(eventId);

      event->SetSpawnTime(getCurrentTime());

      event->SetSpawnLocation(player->GetPosition());

      botSpawnEventBus.QueueEvent(event);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a thread-safe counter or timestamp-based
    generation mechanism to ensure uniqueness. It may utilize internal atomic operations
    or mutex locking depending on the specific implementation within TrinityCore's
    event handling system.
