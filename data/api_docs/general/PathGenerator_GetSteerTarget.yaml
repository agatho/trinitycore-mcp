  class: PathGenerator
  method: GetSteerTarget
  signature: bool PathGenerator::GetSteerTarget(const float * startPos, const float
    * endPos, float minTargetDist, const int * path, int pathSize, float * steerPos,
    unsigned char & steerPosFlag, int & steerPosRef)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a steering target position for path following based on start and
    end positions.
  description: The GetSteerTarget method computes a suitable target position for steering
    an entity along a given path. It takes into account the minimum distance to the
    target, the current path, and calculates a steer position that helps in smooth
    navigation. This function is typically used in AI pathfinding and movement logic
    within TrinityCore's game engine. The method modifies the steer position and flag
    based on the computed steering target, and returns true if a valid target was
    found.
  parameters:
  - name: startPos
    description: A pointer to an array of three floats representing the starting x,
      y, z coordinates.
  - name: endPos
    description: A pointer to an array of three floats representing the ending x,
      y, z coordinates.
  - name: minTargetDist
    description: The minimum distance threshold that determines how close the steer
      target should be to the path.
  - name: path
    description: A pointer to an array of integers representing node indices in the
      path.
  - name: pathSize
    description: An integer indicating the number of nodes in the path array.
  - name: steerPos
    description: A pointer to an array of three floats where the computed steering
      target x, y, z coordinates will be stored.
  - name: steerPosFlag
    description: A reference to an unsigned char that will be set with flags indicating
      the status or type of the computed steer position.
  - name: steerPosRef
    description: A reference to an integer that will be updated with a reference index
      related to the computed steer position.
  returns: Returns true if a valid steering target was successfully calculated and
    stored in steerPos, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetSteerTarget
    code: "float startPos[3] = {10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f};\nfloat endPos[3] = {50.0f, 60.0f,\
      \ 70.0f};\nint path[] = {0, 1, 2, 3};\nfloat steerPos[3];\nunsigned char flag;\n\
      int ref;\nbool result = pathGenerator.GetSteerTarget(startPos, endPos, 5.0f,\
      \ path, 4, steerPos, flag, ref);\nif (result) {\n    // Use steerPos for movement\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PathGenerator class and is used primarily in AI
    navigation systems. It assumes that path nodes are valid and properly initialized.
    The steerPosFlag and steerPosRef provide additional context about how the steering
    target was computed.
  warnings: Ensure that the path array contains valid indices, and that startPos and
    endPos are not null. Incorrect usage of these parameters may lead to undefined
    behavior or invalid steering targets.
