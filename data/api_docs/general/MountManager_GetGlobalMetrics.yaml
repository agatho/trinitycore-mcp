  class: MountManager
  method: GetGlobalMetrics
  signature: const MountMetrics & MountManager::GetGlobalMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the global mount metrics object containing
    aggregate statistics and data for all mounts in the game.
  description: The GetGlobalMetrics method provides access to a singleton-like structure
    that holds cumulative performance and usage data for all mount-related activities
    within the TrinityCore server. This includes information such as total mounts
    spawned, active mount sessions, and other aggregate statistics that help monitor
    and optimize mount behavior across the entire game world. The returned reference
    is const, ensuring that callers cannot modify the internal state of the metrics
    object directly. This method is typically used for administrative monitoring,
    performance analysis, or debugging purposes where global mount data is required
    without altering system state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a MountMetrics object containing aggregate statistics
    and data about all mounts in the game world. The returned object should not be
    modified by the caller as it's a const reference to internal server data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Global Mount Metrics
    code: 'const MountMetrics& metrics = sMountMgr->GetGlobalMetrics();

      uint32 totalSpawns = metrics.totalMountsSpawned;

      uint32 activeSessions = metrics.activeMountSessions;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal server data structure. The
    MountMetrics object should be treated as read-only by callers. Accessing this
    data does not incur significant performance overhead as it's designed to be accessed
    frequently for monitoring purposes.
