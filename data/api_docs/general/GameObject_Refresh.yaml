  brief: Refreshes the GameObject's state and updates its visibility in the world.
  description: The Refresh method updates a GameObject's internal state and ensures
    it is properly visible to players in the world. This method is typically used
    when a GameObject's state needs to be synchronized with the game world, such as
    when changing its display or visibility status. It performs necessary updates
    to ensure the GameObject remains correctly positioned and visible to players,
    especially during dynamic changes like quest completion or game events. The method
    may also trigger related updates to maintain consistency in the game world.

  notes: This method typically triggers internal updates to the GameObject's visibility
    and state. It may involve updating the GameObject's position, display, or other
    properties depending on its type and current state.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause synchronization issues with players'
    visibility in the world, potentially leading to missing or incorrect GameObjects
    in player's view.
