  brief: Initializes and populates AI spell information for the unit's behavior.
  description: The FillAISpellInfo method is responsible for setting up the AI spell
    data structure within a UnitAI instance. This method typically populates internal
    spell lists, cooldowns, and spell priorities that govern how an AI-controlled
    creature will cast spells during combat. It ensures that the AI has access to
    all relevant spell information required for intelligent decision-making in battle
    scenarios. The method is usually called during AI initialization or when the unit's
    spell configuration needs to be refreshed.
