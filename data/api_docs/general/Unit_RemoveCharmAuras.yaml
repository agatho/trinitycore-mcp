  signature: void Unit::RemoveCharmAuras()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all charm auras from the unit, ending any control over the unit.
  description: The RemoveCharmAuras method removes all charm-related auras from the
    Unit object, effectively breaking any charm or control that the unit may have
    been under. This method is typically used when a unit is no longer controlled
    by an external entity, such as when a player's pet or a creature's charm is removed.
    It ensures that the unit returns to its normal state without any charm effects,
    allowing it to act independently again. The method does not require any parameters
    and will affect all charm-related auras present on the unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\n target->RemoveCharmAuras();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that handle
    aura removal or control. It should be called when a unit's charm status needs
    to be removed, such as when a player's pet is dismissed or when a creature's charm
    is broken.
  warnings: This method should not be called on units that are not currently under
    charm control, as it may cause unintended behavior if used incorrectly. Also,
    calling this method on a unit that has already had its charm removed can lead
    to undefined behavior.
