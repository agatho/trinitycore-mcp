documentation:
  brief: Notifies the AI that movement has started for the bot
  description: The OnMovementStarted method is a callback function invoked when a
    bot controlled by the EnhancedBotAI begins moving. This method serves as an event
    handler that allows the AI to react to movement initiation, potentially updating
    internal state, triggering actions, or logging movement events. It is typically
    called by the game engine's movement system when a bot's movement state transitions
    from idle to active. The method does not accept parameters and performs no direct
    operations beyond signaling the start of movement.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnMovementStarted()\n{\n    // Log that bot has started\
      \ moving\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot %u has started moving.\", GetBot()->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    // Update internal state to reflect movement\n    m_isMoving = true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI event system and should be overridden in derived
    classes to implement custom behavior. It is expected to be called frequently during
    gameplay as bots move around, so performance considerations are important for
    any logic implemented within this function.
