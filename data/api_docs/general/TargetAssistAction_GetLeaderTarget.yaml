  method: GetLeaderTarget
  signature: Unit * TargetAssistAction::GetLeaderTarget(Player * leader) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target unit that the specified leader player is currently targeting.
  description: The GetLeaderTarget method is used in the context of group-based AI
    behavior within TrinityCore's framework. It retrieves the current target of a
    given Player object, which is typically used by AI actions that assist or follow
    the leader's target. This method is part of the TargetAssistAction class and plays
    a crucial role in coordinating group member actions based on the leader's focus.
    The returned Unit pointer represents the entity (such as a creature or player)
    that the leader is currently targeting, or nullptr if no valid target exists.
    This functionality supports mechanics like raid coordination, group pet targeting,
    and assist behaviors where minions should follow their leader's target selection.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit that the provided Player leader is currently targeting.
    Returns nullptr if the leader has no valid target or if the leader is not a valid
    player object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI action
    code: "Unit* target = GetLeaderTarget(leaderPlayer);\nif (target != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with assist behavior towards the leader's target\n    DoAssistTarget(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player object is valid and has a valid
    target. The returned Unit pointer should be checked for null before use to prevent
    dereferencing invalid pointers. In multi-threaded environments, ensure proper
    locking mechanisms are in place when accessing player targets.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned Unit pointer will remain valid beyond
    the scope of the current execution context. The target may change or become invalid
    during the time between calling this method and using the returned pointer. Always
    validate the pointer before use.
