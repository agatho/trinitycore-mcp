  signature: bool BotLevelManager::ApplyBot_MainThread(BotCreationTask * task)
documentation:
  brief: Applies bot level adjustments and configurations on the main thread
  description: The ApplyBot_MainThread method is responsible for executing bot level
    management operations within the main game thread context. This method ensures
    that all bot-related configuration changes, including level adjustments, skill
    modifications, and behavior settings, are properly applied in a thread-safe manner.
    It typically handles synchronization with the game's main loop to prevent race
    conditions and maintain consistency across all active bots. The method processes
    the BotCreationTask object passed to it, which contains all necessary parameters
    for bot initialization and configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: task
    description: Pointer to a BotCreationTask object containing all necessary parameters
      and configurations for bot creation and level management
  returns: Returns true if the bot level adjustments were successfully applied and
    processed, false otherwise. The method may return false if the task is invalid,
    processing fails, or if there are synchronization issues with the main thread.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Level Application
    code: "BotCreationTask* task = new BotCreationTask();\n// Configure task parameters\n\
      bool success = botLevelManager->ApplyBot_MainThread(task);\nif (success) {\n\
      \    // Bot level adjustments applied successfully\n    printf(\"Bot level configuration\
      \ applied successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to apply bot level configuration\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method must be called from the main game thread to ensure proper synchronization
    with the game world. It performs blocking operations that may impact performance
    if called frequently. The method assumes that the BotCreationTask parameter is
    properly initialized and contains valid configuration data.
  warnings: Calling this method from a non-main thread may cause undefined behavior
    or race conditions. Ensure that all bot creation parameters are validated before
    passing to this method. This method may block execution of the main game loop
    during processing, so use judiciously in performance-critical sections.
