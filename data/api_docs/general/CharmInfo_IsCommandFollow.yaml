  method: IsCommandFollow
  signature: bool CharmInfo::IsCommandFollow()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the charmed unit is following its master using command-based
    movement.
  description: The IsCommandFollow method checks if the charmed creature or unit is
    currently following its master with a command-based movement behavior. This is
    typically used in the context of pet or minion AI where the unit follows the player's
    commands rather than automatic AI behavior. The method returns true when the charm
    is actively under command-follow mode, indicating that the unit will move according
    to the master's explicit commands instead of default AI patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the charmed unit is currently following its master using
    command-based movement; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a charmed unit is in command-follow mode
    code: "if (player->GetCharmInfo()->IsCommandFollow()) {\n    // Handle command-follow\
      \ behavior\n    sLog->outString(\"Unit is following commands\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in pet and minion AI systems within TrinityCore.
    It's important to note that command-follow mode is typically set when a player
    uses specific commands such as 'follow' or 'attack' on a charm, which changes
    the unit's behavior from passive to active command-based following.
