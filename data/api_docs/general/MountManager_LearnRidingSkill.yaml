  class: MountManager
  method: LearnRidingSkill
  signature: bool MountManager::LearnRidingSkill(int * player, uint32 skillLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Learns the riding skill for a player character, setting their skill level
    to the specified value.
  description: The LearnRidingSkill method is responsible for granting or updating
    a player's riding skill in the TrinityCore emulator. This method allows administrators
    or game systems to assign a specific riding skill level to a player character.
    The skill level parameter determines how advanced the player's riding ability
    becomes, which affects their mount capabilities within the game world. The method
    returns true if the operation is successful and false otherwise. It is typically
    used in conjunction with other player management functions to provide players
    with appropriate riding abilities based on game progression or administrative
    commands.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter identifies which specific player character will have
      their riding skill updated.
  - name: skillLevel
    description: The target skill level to set for the player's riding ability. Valid
      values are typically 75, 150, 225, or 300, corresponding to different mount
      tiers (Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, and Artisan).
  returns: Returns true if the riding skill was successfully learned/updated for the
    player; otherwise returns false. The method may fail if the player pointer is
    invalid or if the specified skill level is not supported.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 ridingLevel = 300;\nbool result = mountManager.LearnRidingSkill(&playerId,\
      \ ridingLevel);\nif (result) {\n    // Riding skill successfully learned\n \
      \   printf(\"Player %d now has Expert Riding skill\\n\", playerId);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Failed to learn riding skill\n    printf(\"Failed to learn riding\
      \ skill for player %d\\n\", playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int* playerPtr = GetPlayerGUID();\nif (playerPtr == nullptr) {\n    printf(\"\
      Invalid player reference\\n\");\n    return false;\n}\n\nuint32 skillLevels[]\
      \ = {75, 150, 225, 300};\nfor (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n    bool success =\
      \ mountManager.LearnRidingSkill(playerPtr, skillLevels[i]);\n    if (!success)\
      \ {\n        printf(\"Failed to set riding skill level %d\\n\", skillLevels[i]);\n\
      \        break;\n    }\n    printf(\"Successfully set riding skill to level\
      \ %d\\n\", skillLevels[i]);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player exists in the database and is properly
    initialized. The skillLevel parameter should be one of the standard World of Warcraft
    riding skill levels (75, 150, 225, 300). Performance-wise, this operation is relatively
    lightweight as it primarily involves updating a single skill entry in the player's
    database record. Thread safety depends on the underlying implementation of MountManager
    and should be verified if used in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: The method may silently fail if passed an invalid player GUID or unsupported
    skill level. Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an existing
    character before calling this method. Using incorrect skill levels (e.g., values
    outside the standard 75-300 range) might lead to unexpected behavior in mount
    availability or game progression.
