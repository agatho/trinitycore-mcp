  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool DeathHookIntegration::IsEnabled()
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the death hook integration feature is currently enabled in
    the TrinityCore server.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the DeathHookIntegration functionality
    has been activated within the TrinityCore framework. This integration typically
    allows for custom handling of player or creature deaths, such as triggering specific
    events, modifying death behavior, or integrating with external systems. The method
    returns a boolean value indicating the current state of this feature. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other death-related hooks and event handlers to ensure
    that custom death logic only executes when explicitly enabled. This check helps
    maintain performance by avoiding unnecessary processing when the integration is
    disabled.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the DeathHookIntegration is currently enabled, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether custom death handling logic should be executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (DeathHookIntegration::IsEnabled()) {\n    // Execute custom death handling\
      \ code\n    HandleCustomDeathLogic();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Death Event Processing
    code: "void Player::OnDeath() {\n    if (DeathHookIntegration::IsEnabled()) {\n\
      \        // Custom death processing logic\n        TriggerDeathEvent();\n  \
      \      ApplyDeathPenalties();\n    } else {\n        // Default death behavior\n\
      \        DefaultDeathHandling();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a simple boolean flag check. It's
    important to note that enabling or disabling this integration may require server
    restart or runtime configuration changes depending on how it's implemented in
    the specific TrinityCore build. The method should be lightweight and thread-safe
    since it's likely called frequently during death events.
  warnings: Ensure that all death-related logic properly checks this flag before executing
    custom behavior to avoid unexpected side effects when the integration is disabled.
    Failure to check this flag may lead to inconsistent behavior or errors in environments
    where the feature is toggled dynamically.
