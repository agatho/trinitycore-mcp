  class: Unit
  method: SetCreatedBySpell
  signature: void Unit::SetCreatedBySpell(int32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spell ID that created this unit.
  description: The SetCreatedBySpell method assigns a spell identifier to the unit,
    indicating which spell was responsible for its creation. This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft mechanics to track the origin of summoned creatures, pets,
    or other game objects. The assigned spell ID can be retrieved later using GetCreatedBySpell()
    and is typically used for spell effects that create temporary entities such as
    totems, guardians, or summoned minions. This method does not validate the spell
    ID against existing spells; it simply stores the provided value.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell identifier (Spell ID) that created this unit. Must be a
      valid spell entry in the database, or zero if no creator spell is assigned.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Unit's Creator Spell
    code: 'Unit* pet = ...;

      pet->SetCreatedBySpell(12345); // Assigns spell ID 12345 as the creator of this
      unit'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a Temporary Creature's Creator Spell
    code: 'Creature* totem = ...;

      totem->SetCreatedBySpell(98765); // Marks this totem as created by spell 98765'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the core when spawning creatures
    or objects via spells. It's important to note that setting a spell ID does not
    automatically trigger any spell effects; it only records the relationship between
    the created unit and its originating spell.
  warnings: Incorrectly assigning a spell ID may lead to unexpected behavior in scripts
    or spell effects that rely on this information. Ensure the spell ID corresponds
    to an actual spell in the database before calling this method.
