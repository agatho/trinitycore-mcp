  signature: void Spell::DoCreateItem(uint32 itemId, int context, const int * bonusListIDs)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a specified item and adds it to the spell's target or player inventory.
  description: The DoCreateItem method is used within the TrinityCore spell system
    to generate and distribute items as part of spell effects. It allows a spell to
    create an item with specific properties, such as bonuses or context, and place
    it in the appropriate inventory slot for the spell's target. This method is typically
    invoked during spell casting when an item creation effect is required, such as
    with enchanting spells, crafting abilities, or certain magical effects that produce
    consumables or equipment. The method supports optional bonus list IDs to apply
    specific item enhancements, and a context parameter to determine how the item
    should be handled (e.g., whether it's a crafted item, a reward, or a temporary
    effect).
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to be created. This ID must correspond
      to a valid entry in the game's item database.
  - name: context
    description: An integer value that defines the context or purpose of the item
      creation, such as crafting type, reward type, or effect duration. The exact
      meaning is determined by the spell implementation and may affect how the item
      is processed or displayed.
  - name: bonusListIDs
    description: An optional array of bonus list identifiers that define specific
      enhancements or modifications to apply to the created item. If null, no bonuses
      are applied.
  returns: This method does not return a value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Creation
    code: 'Spell* spell = ...;

      spell->DoCreateItem(12345, 0, nullptr); // Creates item with ID 12345 in default
      context'
    language: cpp
  - title: Item Creation with Bonuses
    code: 'Spell* spell = ...;

      int bonuses[] = { 1001, 1002 };

      spell->DoCreateItem(67890, 1, bonuses); // Creates item with ID 67890 and bonus
      IDs 1001 and 1002'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell effect handling system in TrinityCore. It
    assumes that the spell has a valid target and that the item creation logic is
    appropriate for the current spell context. The method does not perform any validation
    on the item ID or bonus list IDs beyond basic parameter passing.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId corresponds to an actual item in the game database,
    otherwise the created item may be invalid or cause errors. Incorrect usage of
    the context parameter can lead to unexpected behavior in how the item is handled
    by the client or server.
