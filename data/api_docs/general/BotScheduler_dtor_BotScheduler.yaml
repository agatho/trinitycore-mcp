documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotScheduler instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotScheduler class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the lifetime of the scheduler. It ensures
    proper cleanup of any bot-related data structures, pending tasks, and internal
    state that may have been initialized. This method is automatically invoked when
    a BotScheduler object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this destructor plays a critical role in preventing
    memory leaks and maintaining system stability when bot instances are terminated
    or removed from the game world.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'BotScheduler* scheduler = new BotScheduler();

      // ... use the scheduler ...

      delete scheduler; // Triggers ~BotScheduler()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless managing memory manually.
    It's typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when objects go out of
    scope or are explicitly deleted. Ensure all bot references are properly cleaned
    up before the scheduler is destroyed to avoid dangling pointers.
