  class: RestorationDruid
  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void RestorationDruid::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for restoration druid abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method manages the internal cooldown tracking for
    a restoration druid character. It processes the time elapsed since the last update
    (passed via the diff parameter) and decrements or removes active cooldowns for
    spells and abilities specific to the restoration druid class. This method is typically
    called during the creature's update cycle to ensure accurate cooldown state management.
    The method does not directly trigger spell casting or apply effects, but rather
    maintains the state necessary for determining when abilities can be used again.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update cycle. This
      value is used to determine how much cooldown time has passed and should be updated
      accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Cooldowns Call
    code: "void RestorationDruid::Update()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n  \
      \  UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "void RestorationDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateCooldowns(diff))\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Other AI logic here\n    if (CanCastHeal())\n   \
      \ {\n        CastHeal();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update loop and should be called regularly
    to maintain accurate cooldown states. It's important that diff values are properly
    calculated using the game's internal time system to ensure consistent behavior
    across different server loads.
  warnings: Ensure that the diff parameter represents actual elapsed time since last
    call, as incorrect timing can lead to inaccurate cooldown states or unexpected
    ability usage. Do not call this method outside of the proper AI update context
    unless you are certain about the implications.
