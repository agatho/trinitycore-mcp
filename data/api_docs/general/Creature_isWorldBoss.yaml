  class: Creature
  method: isWorldBoss
  signature: bool Creature::isWorldBoss() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is a world boss instance boss.
  description: This method checks if the creature is classified as a world boss, which
    typically means it's a high-priority boss that appears in world boss instances
    and has special behavior compared to regular creatures. World bosses are usually
    marked with specific flags in the database and have unique drop mechanics, loot
    tables, and quest behaviors. The method returns true when the creature is identified
    as a world boss, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for determining
    proper instance content behavior and handling special world boss events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is a world boss, false otherwise. The return
    value indicates whether the creature has the world boss flag set in its database
    entry or is flagged as such by the game system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->isWorldBoss()) {\n    // Handle world boss specific behavior\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation relies on database flags and creature entry data. This method
    may require checking against multiple conditions in the database to determine
    if a creature is a world boss. Performance impact is minimal as it's a simple
    boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining loot or quest behavior
    directly, as world bosses have special handling that requires additional checks
    beyond this method.
