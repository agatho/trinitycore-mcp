  signature: void DungeonBehavior::AvoidDangerousAreas(Player * player, const int
    & dangerousAreas)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the player to avoid dangerous areas within a dungeon environment.
  description: The AvoidDangerousAreas method is designed to automatically redirect
    a player character away from hazardous zones or threat areas within a dungeon
    setting. This behavior is typically invoked during dungeon encounters to ensure
    player safety by preventing them from entering areas that could cause instant
    death or severe damage. The method evaluates the current position of the player
    and identifies nearby dangerous zones, then calculates and executes a movement
    path that safely moves the player away from these threats. It is commonly used
    in scripted dungeon scenarios where environmental hazards are present and require
    dynamic player response.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that needs to avoid dangerous areas.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent an active player within
      a dungeon environment.
  - name: dangerousAreas
    description: Integer reference representing the identifier or bitmask of dangerous
      areas in the current dungeon context. This value determines which specific threat
      zones the method should consider when calculating avoidance paths.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Encounter
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterDungeon(Player* player)\n{\n    int dangerousAreas =\
      \ 0x01; // Example bitmask for area 1\n    DungeonBehavior::AvoidDangerousAreas(player,\
      \ dangerousAreas);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Dangerous Areas
    code: "void HandleDungeonHazard(Player* player)\n{\n    int dangerousAreas = 0x07;\
      \ // Bitmask for areas 1, 2, and 3\n    DungeonBehavior::AvoidDangerousAreas(player,\
      \ dangerousAreas);\n    // Additional logic to handle other hazards\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the dungeon's threat mapping system to identify dangerous
    areas. The player's current position and movement capabilities are evaluated before
    executing any avoidance path. Performance is optimized by caching area boundaries
    and using efficient pathfinding algorithms. The method assumes that the player
    is already within a valid dungeon environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent null pointer exceptions. The dangerousAreas parameter must correspond
    to actual defined threat zones in the current dungeon context; otherwise, the
    avoidance logic may not function correctly. This method should only be called
    during active dungeon encounters when environmental hazards are present.
