  class: GroupModel
  method: GroupModel
  signature: void GroupModel::GroupModel(uint32 mogpFlags, uint32 groupWMOID, const
    int & bound)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GroupModel with specified flags, group WMO ID, and bounding
    information.
  description: The GroupModel constructor initializes a GroupModel object with the
    provided parameters. This method sets up internal state for a group of WMO (World
    Map Object) models, which are used in World of Warcraft's terrain and environment
    rendering system. The mogpFlags parameter defines various properties and behaviors
    of the group model, such as visibility settings or collision flags. The groupWMOID
    identifies which specific WMO file this group belongs to, while the bound parameter
    specifies the bounding box coordinates that define the spatial extent of the group.
    This initialization is typically called during map loading or when constructing
    dynamic group models for in-game environments.
  parameters:
  - name: mogpFlags
    description: Flags that define properties and behaviors of the group model, such
      as visibility, collision detection, and rendering options. These flags are typically
      defined by the WMO format specification.
  - name: groupWMOID
    description: Unique identifier for the WMO (World Map Object) file that this group
      belongs to. This ID is used to reference the correct WMO data during rendering
      and collision processing.
  - name: bound
    description: Reference to an integer value representing bounding information for
      the group model, typically used to define spatial extent or other geometric
      properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GroupModel Initialization
    code: 'GroupModel model(0x00000001, 12345, bound);

      // Initializes a group model with basic flags, WMO ID 12345, and specified bounding
      information'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal World of Warcraft map rendering
    system. Developers should not directly instantiate GroupModel objects unless working
    with low-level map data structures or custom terrain systems. The bound parameter
    is typically derived from WMO file data and represents geometric bounds for efficient
    spatial queries.
  warnings: Improper initialization of GroupModel parameters may lead to rendering
    artifacts, incorrect collision detection, or memory access violations. Ensure
    that the provided flags are valid according to the WMO specification and that
    the groupWMOID references an existing WMO file in the game resources.
