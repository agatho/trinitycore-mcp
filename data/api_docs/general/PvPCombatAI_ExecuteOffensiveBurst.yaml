  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: ExecuteOffensiveBurst
  signature: bool PvPCombatAI::ExecuteOffensiveBurst(int * player, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes an offensive burst ability in PvP combat, returning true if successful.
  description: The ExecuteOffensiveBurst method is designed to initiate a high-damage
    burst attack during PvP encounters. It evaluates the current combat state and
    player readiness before executing the offensive maneuver. The method typically
    checks for valid target conditions, resource availability (such as mana or energy),
    and cooldown status of the burst ability. This function is part of the PvPCombatAI
    class which governs AI behavior in player versus player scenarios within TrinityCore.
    It ensures that burst abilities are only used when optimal conditions are met
    to maximize effectiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object initiating the burst attack. Must be
      a valid pointer to a Player instance.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object being attacked. Must be a valid pointer
      to a Unit instance representing an enemy player or creature.
  returns: Returns true if the offensive burst was successfully executed and applied
    to the target, false otherwise. The method may return false due to invalid parameters,
    insufficient resources, cooldowns, or other combat restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in PvP combat AI
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nPvPCombatAI ai;\nbool success\
      \ = ai.ExecuteOffensiveBurst(&player, &target);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Burst\
      \ attack executed successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Offensive burst executed\
      \ successfully.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with error handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nPvPCombatAI ai;\n\nif (!player\
      \ || !target)\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid player or target in ExecuteOffensiveBurst\"\
      );\n    return false;\n}\n\nbool result = ai.ExecuteOffensiveBurst(&player,\
      \ &target);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Handle successful burst execution\n    player->AddComboPoint(target);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle failed burst attempt\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed\
      \ to execute offensive burst\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the AI system during PvP encounters when
    certain conditions are met. The implementation likely includes checks for spell
    cooldowns, resource availability, and target validity. Performance considerations
    include avoiding unnecessary computations if preconditions are not satisfied.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method to prevent segmentation faults. This method should only be called during
    active PvP combat scenarios where burst abilities are appropriate.
