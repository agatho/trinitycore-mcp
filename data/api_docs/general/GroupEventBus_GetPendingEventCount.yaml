  method: GetPendingEventCount
  signature: uint32 GroupEventBus::GetPendingEventCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of pending events in the group event bus.
  description: The GetPendingEventCount method retrieves the current count of events
    that are queued for processing within the GroupEventBus. This count represents
    all events that have been added to the bus but not yet dispatched or handled.
    The method is typically used for monitoring and debugging purposes, allowing developers
    to track event queue sizes and ensure proper event handling. It provides a snapshot
    of the event bus state at the time of the call and does not modify any internal
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of pending events currently queued
    in the GroupEventBus. Returns zero if no events are pending.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Pending Events
    code: "uint32 pendingCount = groupEventBus.GetPendingEventCount();\nif (pendingCount\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Warning: %u pending events\
      \ in group event bus\", pendingCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only operation on the internal event queue and
    is generally thread-safe if the underlying queue implementation supports concurrent
    reads. The returned count reflects the state at the moment of the call, so it
    may change immediately after the method returns.
