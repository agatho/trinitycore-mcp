  method: HasQuestLogSpace
  signature: bool QuestAcceptanceManager::HasQuestLogSpace() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has available space in their quest log for accepting
    new quests.
  description: The HasQuestLogSpace method determines if a player's quest log has
    sufficient capacity to accept additional quests. In World of Warcraft, players
    can only carry a limited number of active quests simultaneously, typically 25
    slots. This method evaluates the current state of the player's quest log and returns
    true if there is at least one available slot, or false if the quest log is full.
    The check is performed without modifying any quest data and is commonly used by
    quest acceptance logic to prevent players from accepting quests when their log
    is already at maximum capacity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least one available quest log slot, false
    if the quest log is full (currently 25 active quests).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance Check
    code: "if (player->GetQuestAcceptanceManager()->HasQuestLogSpace()) {\n    //\
      \ Player can accept a new quest\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Inform player that quest log is full\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Your quest log is full.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest log tracking system and does not
    directly interact with database queries. It should be called before attempting
    to add a new quest to avoid potential errors or silent failures in quest acceptance
    logic.
  warnings: Do not assume that a player will always have space available. Always check
    this method before calling quest acceptance functions, as exceeding the maximum
    quest log capacity can lead to unexpected behavior or quest data corruption.
