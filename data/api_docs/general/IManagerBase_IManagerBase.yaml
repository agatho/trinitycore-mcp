documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of IManagerBase by copying data from an existing
    instance
  description: The IManagerBase constructor is responsible for initializing a new
    instance of the IManagerBase class by performing a copy operation from another
    IManagerBase instance. This method typically handles deep copying of internal
    data structures and ensures proper initialization of member variables. In the
    context of TrinityCore's architecture, this constructor likely manages resource
    allocation and state copying for manager objects that oversee various subsystems
    within the game server. The implementation should ensure thread safety when multiple
    threads access or copy manager instances simultaneously.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source IManagerBase instance to copy data from. This parameter
      represents the existing manager object whose state will be duplicated in the
      newly constructed instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Copy Construction Example
    code: 'IManagerBase originalManager;

      // ... initialize originalManager ...

      IManagerBase newManager(originalManager); // Uses copy constructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Manager Instance Usage in Server Context
    code: "class WorldManager : public IManagerBase {\npublic:\n    WorldManager(const\
      \ WorldManager& other) : IManagerBase(other) {\n        // Additional initialization\
      \ specific to WorldManager\n    }\n};\n\nWorldManager* manager = new WorldManager();\n\
      WorldManager* copy = new WorldManager(*manager);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used in scenarios where manager objects need
    to be duplicated for different contexts or threads. The implementation should
    handle potential memory management concerns and ensure that all internal data
    structures are properly copied without sharing references that could lead to race
    conditions.
  warnings: When implementing or using this constructor, developers must ensure that
    the copy operation doesn't inadvertently create shared state between instances.
    This is particularly important in multi-threaded environments where manager objects
    may be accessed concurrently by different threads.
