documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the value of a specified rate multiplier used in game mechanics.
  description: The getRate method returns the current value of a specific rate multiplier
    that affects various game mechanics such as experience gain, loot drops, or gold
    rewards. This method is commonly used to query server configuration values that
    control how quickly players progress or acquire resources. The method takes a
    Rates enumeration parameter that specifies which rate value to retrieve. It's
    typically called during gameplay events or calculations where the current rate
    settings are needed for accurate computations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current rate multiplier for the specified
    game mechanic. This value is usually greater than or equal to zero, with 1.0 representing
    normal rates and values above or below 1.0 indicating increased or decreased rates
    respectively.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Experience Rate
    code: float expRate = World::instance()->getRate(Rates::Rate_XP);
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate Modified Reward Amount
    code: 'float goldRate = World::instance()->getRate(Rates::Rate_Gold);

      uint32 baseGold = 1000;

      uint32 modifiedGold = baseGold * goldRate;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads configuration values that are
    typically set at startup and don't change during runtime. The implementation likely
    uses cached values for performance reasons, avoiding expensive calculations or
    database lookups on each call.
  warnings: Ensure that the Rates enumeration value passed to this method is valid,
    as invalid values may return unexpected results or cause undefined behavior. This
    method should not be used in performance-critical code paths where multiple calls
    are made in tight loops without caching the result.
