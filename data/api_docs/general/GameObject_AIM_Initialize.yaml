documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AI system for the game object, setting up internal AI state
    and behavior.
  description: The AIM_Initialize method is responsible for initializing the AI subsystem
    for a GameObject instance. This method sets up the necessary internal data structures
    and states required for the object to function within the AI framework. It typically
    configures AI behavior flags, initializes AI context variables, and prepares the
    object for AI-driven interactions such as pathfinding, combat behavior, or scripted
    events. The method is usually called during the object's creation or activation
    phase, ensuring that the AI system is properly configured before any AI-related
    operations are performed. This initialization process may involve loading AI scripts,
    setting default behavior parameters, and registering the object with the AI manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI initialization was successful and all required components
    were properly set up; returns false if the initialization failed due to missing
    dependencies, invalid configuration, or other internal errors. A failure typically
    indicates that the GameObject will not function correctly within the AI system
    until the issue is resolved.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Initialization Check
    code: "GameObject* go = ...; // Assume GameObject is created\nif (go->AIM_Initialize())\
      \ {\n    // AI system successfully initialized\n    sLog->outString(\"AI initialized\
      \ for GameObject %u\", go->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ initialization failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize AI for GameObject\
      \ %u\", go->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the object's lifecycle, typically
    during construction or activation. Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior
    or resource leaks. The method assumes that all necessary dependencies for AI functionality
    are already loaded and available in the system.
  warnings: Calling this method on a GameObject that is already initialized may cause
    memory corruption or inconsistent AI state. Ensure that AI initialization occurs
    only once per object instance, and avoid calling it on objects that are already
    part of an active AI system.
