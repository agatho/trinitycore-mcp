api:
  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: GetHistoricalPricePattern
  signature: int MarketAnalysis::GetHistoricalPricePattern(uint32 itemId, uint32 daysBack)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes historical price data for a specified item over a given number of
    days to determine market trends.
  description: 'The GetHistoricalPricePattern method retrieves and analyzes historical
    pricing data for a specific item within the game''s auction house system. It examines
    price fluctuations, trends, and patterns over the specified time period (in days)
    to provide insights into market behavior. This functionality is crucial for players
    engaged in economic activities such as crafting, trading, or auction house management.
    The method likely interacts with internal market data structures and may utilize
    caching mechanisms to improve performance. Precondition: The item ID must correspond
    to a valid item in the game database; the daysBack parameter should be a positive
    integer representing the lookback period.'
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the item for which historical price data is
      requested. Must correspond to a valid item entry in the game's database.
  - name: daysBack
    description: Number of days into the past to analyze for price trends. Should
      be a positive integer representing the duration of historical data to consider.
  returns: Returns an integer value that represents the identified price pattern or
    trend category. Possible return values may include codes indicating stable, increasing,
    decreasing, or volatile price movements. A negative value might indicate an error
    or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int pattern = marketAnalysis.GetHistoricalPricePattern(18732, 30); // Analyze
      price pattern for item ID 18732 over the last 30 days
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Return Value
    code: "int result = marketAnalysis.GetHistoricalPricePattern(12345, 7);\nif (result\
      \ >= 0) {\n    // Process valid pattern result\n    printf(\"Price pattern code:\
      \ %d\\n\", result);\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Error\
      \ retrieving price pattern\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries or accesses cached market data
    structures to compute historical patterns. Performance may be affected by the
    number of days requested and the complexity of the underlying data model. The
    implementation might cache results for frequently queried items to reduce database
    load.
  warnings: Ensure that itemId corresponds to a valid item in the game's database,
    as invalid IDs could lead to undefined behavior or errors. The method assumes
    sufficient historical data exists for the specified time period; otherwise, it
    may return incomplete or unreliable pattern analysis.
