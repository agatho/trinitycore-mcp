  class: FormationManager
  method: CoordinateMovement
  signature: void FormationManager::CoordinateMovement(const int & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates movement of units in a formation towards a specified destination.
  description: The CoordinateMovement method manages the movement behavior of units
    within a formation, directing them to move toward a given destination coordinate.
    This method is typically used in AI systems to control group movement patterns,
    ensuring that multiple units maintain their formation while navigating to a target
    location. The method likely handles pathfinding, unit coordination, and formation
    maintenance during transit. It may be invoked when a leader unit receives a movement
    command or when the formation needs to reposition itself.
  parameters:
  - name: destination
    description: The destination coordinate or position that the formation should
      move towards. This parameter likely represents a target location in world coordinates,
      possibly as an integer value representing a specific point or area within the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Movement
    code: 'FormationManager* manager = player->GetFormationManager();

      manager->CoordinateMovement(12345); // Move formation to destination with ID
      12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that manages group behavior
    in World of Warcraft. The destination parameter may be interpreted as either a
    direct coordinate value or an identifier for a specific location within the game
    world. Implementation details suggest this method handles synchronization between
    multiple units to maintain formation integrity during movement.
