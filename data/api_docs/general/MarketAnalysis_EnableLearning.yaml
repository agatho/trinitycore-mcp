api:
  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: EnableLearning
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::EnableLearning(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the learning functionality within the market analysis
    system.
  description: The EnableLearning method controls whether the MarketAnalysis class
    will process and analyze learning-related data. When enabled, the system can track
    player skill acquisitions, spell learning, and other educational progress within
    the game environment. This functionality is typically used in conjunction with
    market data analysis to understand how player development impacts economic trends.
    The method does not require any specific preconditions but may affect performance
    if called frequently during active gameplay sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value that determines the state of learning functionality.
      If true, learning features are enabled; if false, they are disabled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Learning Functionality
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      analysis.EnableLearning(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Learning for Performance Optimization
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      // Temporarily disable learning during intensive market data processing

      analysis.EnableLearning(false);

      // Perform heavy computations here

      analysis.EnableLearning(true); // Re-enable after processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags or state variables within the
    MarketAnalysis class. It's recommended to call this method during initialization
    or when transitioning between different operational modes rather than repeatedly
    during runtime for performance reasons.
  warnings: Calling EnableLearning with frequent toggling may cause unexpected behavior
    in data collection or analysis results. Ensure that learning features are properly
    disabled before performing heavy computational tasks to avoid potential conflicts.
