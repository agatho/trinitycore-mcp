documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Brewmaster Monk AI behavior for the specified player bot.
  description: The BrewmasterMonkRefactored constructor initializes the AI behavior
    for a Brewmaster Monk class player bot within the TrinityCore environment. This
    method sets up the necessary internal state and configuration required for the
    bot to perform Brewmaster Monk-specific actions such as managing brewing mechanics,
    handling stances, and executing combat strategies tailored for the Brewmaster
    specialization. The initialization process includes setting up action priorities,
    defining spell usage patterns, and configuring the bot's decision-making logic
    based on current game state conditions like health, mana, and target status.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: BrewmasterMonkRefactored* monkAI = new BrewmasterMonkRefactored(bot);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    pointer must be valid and represent an active player object with the Brewmaster
    Monk class. Internal state variables are initialized during construction to ensure
    proper AI behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same bot instance as
    it may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the Player pointer
    is properly validated before passing to avoid crashes.
