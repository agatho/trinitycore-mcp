documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the entry ID from an ObjectGuid, which typically represents the
    type or template ID of the object.
  description: The GetEntry method extracts and returns the entry identifier from
    an ObjectGuid. In TrinityCore's context, ObjectGuids are used to uniquely identify
    game objects such as players, creatures, game objects, items, etc. The entry ID
    within the GUID usually corresponds to the database template or type ID that defines
    the object's properties. This method is commonly used when working with object
    references in game logic, quest systems, or when determining what kind of entity
    a particular GUID represents. The returned value is typically used for comparisons,
    lookups in databases, or identifying specific object types within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the entry ID portion of the ObjectGuid.
    This value typically corresponds to the database entry ID that defines the type
    or template of the object (e.g., creature entry, item entry, game object entry).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get creature entry from GUID
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Creature>(12345);

      uint32 entry = guid.GetEntry();

      // entry will be 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using entry ID for creature type lookup
    code: 'ObjectGuid playerGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(98765);

      uint32 playerEntry = playerGuid.GetEntry();

      // playerEntry is 98765, can be used to query player data from database'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes the ObjectGuid has been properly constructed with a valid
    high GUID type. The returned entry ID may not always represent a direct database
    row index but rather an identifier that maps to a specific game object template
    or type definition in TrinityCore's systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the ObjectGuid was created using a proper HighGuid type before
    calling GetEntry, as incorrect high GUID types might lead to unexpected behavior.
    The method does not validate whether the returned entry ID is valid or exists
    in the database.
