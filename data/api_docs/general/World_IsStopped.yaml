  class: World
  method: IsStopped
  signature: bool World::IsStopped()
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the world server is currently in a stopped state.
  description: The IsStopped method determines if the World server has entered a stopped
    state, typically indicating that the server is shutting down or paused. This method
    is commonly used to prevent operations from executing when the server is not fully
    operational. The return value reflects the internal state of the world server's
    shutdown process, which can be useful for ensuring clean shutdowns and preventing
    resource access during critical transitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the world server is in a stopped state, false otherwise.
    A stopped state usually indicates that the server is either shutting down or has
    been paused, and normal operations should not proceed.
  examples:
  - title: Check if World Server is Stopped Before Processing
    code: "if (!sWorld->IsStopped())\n{\n    // Perform normal server operations\n\
      \    sWorld->UpdateSessions();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle shutdown scenario\n\
      \    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"Server is stopping, skipping updates.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks an internal flag or state variable that is set
    during server shutdown procedures. It's important to note that checking this flag
    frequently can impact performance if done in tight loops. The implementation may
    involve thread synchronization depending on how the shutdown state is managed
    internally.
