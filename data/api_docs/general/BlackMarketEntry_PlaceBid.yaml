  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: PlaceBid
  signature: void BlackMarketEntry::PlaceBid(int bid, Player * player, int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Places a bid on a black market item for the specified player.
  description: The PlaceBid method processes a bid placed by a player on a black market
    auction. It validates the bid amount against the current minimum bid, checks if
    the player has sufficient funds, and updates the auction state accordingly. This
    method is typically invoked when a player attempts to place a bid through the
    black market interface in World of Warcraft. The method handles currency deduction
    and may trigger notifications or updates to the auction's state.
  parameters:
  - name: bid
    description: The amount of currency the player wishes to bid for the item.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player placing the
      bid.
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier used to track the bid operation, likely for
      logging or rollback purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bid Placement
    code: 'BlackMarketEntry* entry = sBlackMarketMgr->GetBlackMarketEntry(12345);

      Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object

      entry->PlaceBid(5000, player, 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the auction system's internal state management
    and may involve database transactions. It is expected to be called from within
    a game context where player actions are processed.
  warnings: Improper validation of bid amounts or player currency can lead to incorrect
    auction states or exploits. Ensure that all parameters are validated before calling
    this method.
