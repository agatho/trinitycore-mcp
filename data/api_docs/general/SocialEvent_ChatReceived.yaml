  class: SocialEvent
  method: ChatReceived
  signature: SocialEvent SocialEvent::ChatReceived(int player, int target, std::string
    msg, ChatMsg type)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new SocialEvent instance representing a chat message
    received by a player.
  description: The ChatReceived method is used to generate a SocialEvent object that
    represents a chat message received from one player to another in the World of
    Warcraft environment. This method is typically invoked when processing incoming
    chat messages within the TrinityCore framework, allowing for proper event handling
    and logging of social interactions between players. The returned SocialEvent can
    then be used by the game's social system to trigger appropriate actions such as
    displaying messages in the chat window, notifying other players, or updating player
    relationship states. This method is part of the broader social interaction system
    that governs how players communicate within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who sent the chat message
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player receiving the chat
      message
  - name: msg
    description: The actual text content of the chat message being sent
  - name: type
    description: The type of chat message being sent, indicating the context and visibility
      (e.g., SAY, YELL, WHISPER)
  returns: A new SocialEvent instance representing the received chat message, containing
    all relevant information about the sender, receiver, message content, and chat
    type for further processing by the social system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chat Received Event Creation
    code: SocialEvent event = SocialEvent::ChatReceived(12345, 67890, "Hello there!",
      CHAT_MSG_SAY);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Whisper Chat Event
    code: SocialEvent whisperEvent = SocialEvent::ChatReceived(playerGuid, targetGuid,
      "Private message", CHAT_MSG_WHISPER);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore server when
    processing incoming chat packets from clients. The returned SocialEvent object
    should be properly handled by the social event system to ensure correct message
    delivery and player interaction tracking. Developers should be aware that this
    method creates a new object instance each time it's called, so frequent usage
    may impact performance if not managed properly.
  warnings: Ensure that player GUIDs are valid before calling this method, as invalid
    GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or crashes within the social event system.
    Also, be cautious when using this method outside of normal chat packet processing
    contexts, as it may bypass certain validation checks that occur during standard
    gameplay operations.
