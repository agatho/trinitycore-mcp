  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: IsSystemOverloaded
  signature: bool BotPerformanceMonitor::IsSystemOverloaded() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the system is overloaded based on performance metrics.
  description: The IsSystemOverloaded method evaluates current system performance
    metrics to determine if the server is operating under excessive load. This method
    typically monitors CPU usage, memory consumption, and other resource-intensive
    factors to decide if bot operations should be throttled or paused. It's commonly
    used in TrinityCore's bot management systems to maintain server stability and
    prevent performance degradation during high-load scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the system is considered overloaded based on predefined
    thresholds; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botMonitor.IsSystemOverloaded()) {\n    // Pause bot activities\n \
      \   botManager.PauseAllBots();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Integration
    code: "void BotPerformanceMonitor::Update() {\n    if (IsSystemOverloaded()) {\n\
      \        sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_BOTS, \"System overload detected. Reducing\
      \ bot activity.\");\n        // Implement throttling logic\n    } else {\n \
      \       sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_BOTS, \"System performance normal.\");\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal counters and thresholds to make its determination.
    The exact metrics and thresholds may vary depending on server configuration and
    bot implementation details.
