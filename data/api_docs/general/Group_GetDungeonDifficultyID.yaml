documentation:
  brief: Returns the dungeon difficulty identifier for the group's current dungeon
    setting
  description: This method retrieves the unique difficulty identifier associated with
    the group's current dungeon difficulty setting. The returned value corresponds
    to the difficulty levels defined in the game's difficulty system, such as normal,
    heroic, and mythic modes. This identifier is used internally by the game engine
    to determine which set of rules, loot tables, and encounter difficulties should
    be applied to the group's current dungeon instance. The method does not validate
    whether the group is actually in a dungeon or if the difficulty setting is valid;
    it simply returns the stored difficulty ID value from the group object.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the dungeon difficulty identifier. Common values
    include 1 for normal difficulty, 2 for heroic difficulty, and 3 for mythic difficulty,
    though exact values may vary based on game version and expansion content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int difficultyId\
      \ = group->GetDungeonDifficultyID();\n    // Use difficultyId to determine encounter\
      \ settings\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Difficulty Level
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int difficultyId\
      \ = group->GetDungeonDifficultyID();\n    switch (difficultyId)\n    {\n   \
      \     case 1:\n            // Normal difficulty\n            break;\n      \
      \  case 2:\n            // Heroic difficulty\n            break;\n        case\
      \ 3:\n            // Mythic difficulty\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the difficulty ID that was set for the group, which may
    not necessarily reflect the current dungeon instance's actual difficulty if the
    group has changed difficulties since joining. The value is typically set when
    a player joins a dungeon or when the group leader changes the difficulty setting.
  warnings: The returned difficulty ID does not guarantee that the group is currently
    in a dungeon or that the difficulty level is valid for the current map. Developers
    should validate the context before using this value for critical game logic decisions.
