documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the MovementValidator class for validating
    player movement data.
  description: The MovementValidator constructor initializes the internal state and
    data structures required for validating movement-related information in World
    of Warcraft. This class is typically used to ensure that player movements comply
    with game rules and prevent cheating or invalid movement patterns. The validator
    may perform checks such as verifying movement speed limits, detecting teleportation
    exploits, and ensuring coordinate integrity during client-server communication.
    It's designed to be lightweight and efficient for real-time validation during
    gameplay.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a MovementValidator instance
    code: 'MovementValidator validator;

      // The validator is now ready to validate movement data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation itself; it only sets up
    the object for subsequent validation operations. The actual validation logic is
    typically performed by other methods in the class such as ValidateMovement().
    This class is usually instantiated once per player session or movement context.
