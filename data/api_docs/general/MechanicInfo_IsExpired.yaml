  signature: bool MechanicInfo::IsExpired(uint32 currentTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a mechanic effect has expired based on the provided current
    time.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if a mechanic effect, such as a stun
    or root, has reached its expiration time. It compares the stored expiration time
    of the mechanic with the provided current time value. This method is typically
    used in combat and aura systems to manage temporary effects that have limited
    durations. The mechanic's expiration time is usually set when the effect is applied
    and is compared against the global game time to determine if the effect should
    be removed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the mechanic effect has expired (i.e., current time is
    greater than or equal to the stored expiration time), otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (mechanicInfo.IsExpired(GetGameTime())) {\n    // Remove the mechanic\
      \ effect from the unit\n    unit->RemoveMechanicEffect(mechanicType);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Mechanic Effects
    code: "for (auto& mechanic : unit->GetActiveMechanics()) {\n    if (mechanic.IsExpired(GetGameTime()))\
      \ {\n        unit->RemoveMechanic(mechanic.GetType());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the MechanicInfo object has been properly initialized
    with an expiration time. The currentTime parameter should typically be obtained
    from the game's global time source to ensure consistency across all mechanic checks.
