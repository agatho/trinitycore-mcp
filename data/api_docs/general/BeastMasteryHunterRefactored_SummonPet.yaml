documentation:
  brief: Summons the hunter's pet based on the current beast mastery specialization
    and available pet slots.
  description: The SummonPet method is responsible for summoning a pet for a Beast
    Mastery hunter class. This method typically checks if the hunter has an active
    pet, whether they have the required resources (such as focus or mana), and if
    there are any restrictions on pet summoning such as combat status or existing
    pet limitations. It integrates with the World of Warcraft's pet system to ensure
    that only one pet is summoned at a time, and it respects the hunter's current
    specialization and available pet abilities. The method does not return any value
    but modifies the state of the hunter's pet and associated game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Summoning
    code: 'BeastMasteryHunterRefactored* hunter = ...;

      hunter->SummonPet(); // Summons the hunter''s pet if conditions are met'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player
    uses a pet summoning spell or ability. It assumes that the hunter object has been
    properly initialized and that the player character is in a valid state to summon
    a pet.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without checking preconditions may result
    in unexpected behavior, such as attempting to summon multiple pets or summoning
    a pet during combat when it's not allowed.
