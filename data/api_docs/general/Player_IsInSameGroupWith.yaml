  signature: bool Player::IsInSameGroupWith(const Player * p) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is in the same group as another player.
  description: This method checks if the current player and the specified player are
    members of the same group, which includes both raid and party groups. It returns
    true if both players belong to the same group or subgroup, and false otherwise.
    The method considers both party and raid group membership, making it useful for
    determining player relationships in group-based gameplay scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if both players are in the same group (either party or raid),
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the players share the same group membership
    regardless of their specific roles within that group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsInSameGroupWith(targetPlayer)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in group-based questing, loot distribution,
    and player interaction systems. It's important to note that this method will return
    false if either player is not in any group, even if they are in the same instance.
  warnings: This method does not consider whether players are in the same instance
    or zone; it only checks group membership. Be cautious when using this in scenarios
    where players might be in different instances but still share a group.
