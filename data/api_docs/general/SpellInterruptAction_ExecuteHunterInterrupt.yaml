  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecuteHunterInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteHunterInterrupt(BotAI * ai,
    ::Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts a hunter's spell cast by the bot AI on a target unit.
  description: The ExecuteHunterInterrupt method is responsible for handling the interruption
    of a hunter's ongoing spell cast within the TrinityCore AI framework. This method
    is typically invoked when the bot AI needs to break or cancel an enemy hunter's
    spell, such as during combat situations where spell interruption is necessary
    for tactical advantage. The method takes in the AI context, target unit, and the
    spell ID of the spell being interrupted. It returns an ActionResult indicating
    whether the interruption was successful or not.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the bot's behavior and
      decision-making process.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target on which the spell
      interruption is being attempted.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being interrupted, used to determine
      the appropriate action or response.
  returns: An ActionResult enum value indicating the result of the spell interruption
    attempt. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, or NOT_APPLICABLE depending
    on whether the interruption was processed and executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteHunterInterrupt
    code: "ActionResult result = SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteHunterInterrupt(ai,\
      \ target, 12345);\nif (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Spell interruption\
      \ was successful\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI subsystem and should only be called in
    contexts where spell interruption logic is relevant. The method assumes that the
    target unit is a valid hunter with an active spell cast.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is indeed casting a spell before calling this
    method, as calling it on non-casting units may result in undefined behavior or
    failure to interrupt anything.
