  class: GroupEventBus
  method: ValidateEvent
  signature: bool GroupEventBus::ValidateEvent(const GroupEvent & event) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a GroupEvent object is properly initialized and contains
    valid data for processing within the GroupEventBus.
  description: The ValidateEvent method checks if a given GroupEvent object meets
    all necessary criteria to be considered valid for use in the GroupEventBus system.
    It ensures that required fields are populated, data types are correct, and event-specific
    constraints are satisfied. This validation is crucial before attempting to dispatch
    or process events through the group event bus, as invalid events can lead to undefined
    behavior or system instability. The method performs checks on event identifiers,
    participant lists, timestamps, and other relevant properties depending on the
    event type.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The GroupEvent object to validate. This parameter must be a valid
      reference to a GroupEvent instance that has been properly constructed with all
      required fields populated.
  returns: Returns true if the event passes all validation checks and is considered
    valid for use in the GroupEventBus system; otherwise returns false if any validation
    criteria are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Validation
    code: "GroupEvent testEvent;\ntestEvent.SetEventType(GROUP_EVENT_TYPE_QUEST_UPDATE);\n\
      testEvent.SetGroupId(12345);\nbool isValid = groupEventBus.ValidateEvent(testEvent);\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with event processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Event Dispatch Context
    code: "void ProcessGroupEvents()\n{\n    for (const auto& event : pendingEvents)\n\
      \    {\n        if (groupEventBus.ValidateEvent(event))\n        {\n       \
      \     groupEventBus.DispatchEvent(event);\n        }\n        else\n       \
      \ {\n            // Log invalid event and skip processing\n            sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid group event detected: %u\", event.GetEventId());\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs comprehensive validation but does not modify the input
    event object. The validation logic may vary depending on the specific GroupEventType
    and implementation details of the GroupEventBus. It's recommended to validate
    events before adding them to any processing queues or dispatching them to subscribers.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or partially constructed GroupEvent
    object can result in undefined behavior. Ensure that all required fields are properly
    set before validation. This method should not be used as a replacement for proper
    event construction and initialization checks.
