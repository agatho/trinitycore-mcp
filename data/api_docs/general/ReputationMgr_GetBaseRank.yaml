  signature: int ReputationMgr::GetBaseRank(const FactionEntry * factionEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the base reputation rank for a given faction entry.
  description: The GetBaseRank method returns the base reputation rank of a player
    for a specific faction. This value represents the starting reputation level before
    any modifiers or bonuses are applied. The method takes a FactionEntry pointer
    as input and returns an integer representing the rank, which corresponds to the
    standard World of Warcraft reputation levels (Hated, Hostile, Unfriendly, Neutral,
    Friendly, Honored, Revered, Exalted). This is used internally by the game engine
    to determine initial faction standings and progression mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the base reputation rank for the specified faction.
    Possible values range from 0 (Hated) to 7 (Exalted), where each number corresponds
    to a specific reputation tier in the game's reputation system.
  examples:
  - title: Get Base Rank for a Faction
    code: "const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1118); // Example\
      \ faction ID\nint baseRank = player->GetReputationMgr().GetBaseRank(faction);\n\
      if (baseRank >= 4) {\n    // Player has at least Neutral reputation with this\
      \ faction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not account for temporary reputation changes or bonus modifiers
    that may be applied during gameplay. It returns only the base rank as defined
    in the faction's configuration data. The returned value is used primarily in internal
    calculations and UI display rather than direct player interaction.
