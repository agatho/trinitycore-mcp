documentation:
  brief: Starts and manages the worker thread for spatial hostile cache processing.
  description: The WorkerThreadMain method is the entry point for the spatial hostile
    cache background thread. It initializes the thread's operational loop, where it
    continuously processes hostile unit data within the spatial cache system. This
    method handles thread lifecycle management including startup, execution of cache
    update routines, and graceful shutdown. The thread operates in a continuous loop,
    periodically refreshing the spatial hostile cache based on game world updates
    and player movement events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Starting the Spatial Hostile Cache Thread
    code: 'SpatialHostileCache cache;

      cache.WorkerThreadMain(); // Starts the background processing thread'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spatial hostile cache subsystem.
    The worker thread operates independently and should not be invoked directly from
    game logic threads. Performance considerations include periodic cache refresh
    intervals and memory usage for storing hostile unit references.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method may cause thread safety issues if not
    properly synchronized with other cache operations. The method assumes proper initialization
    of the spatial cache system before execution.
