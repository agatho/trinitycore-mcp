  class: Unit
  method: RemoveNpcFlag
  signature: void Unit::RemoveNpcFlag(NPCFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes specified NPC flags from a unit's flag list.
  description: This method removes the specified NPCFlags from a Unit's internal flag
    list, effectively changing the unit's behavior and appearance in the game world.
    It is commonly used to modify NPC interaction behavior, such as removing vendor
    flags or quest-giver flags. The method operates on the unit's current NPCFlag
    set, allowing for precise control over which flags are removed without affecting
    other flags. This functionality is essential for managing NPC behavior during
    quest events or when modifying NPC interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The NPCFlags to remove from the unit. Valid values include any combination
      of standard NPCFlag types such as NPC_FLAG_VENDOR, NPC_FLAG_QUESTGiver, etc.
      The flags are typically defined in the TrinityCore constants and represent specific
      behaviors or capabilities of NPCs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Vendor Flag
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->RemoveNpcFlag(NPC_FLAG_VENDOR);

      // This removes the vendor flag from the unit, making it no longer a vendor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AddNpcFlag to modify NPC
    behavior. It operates on the unit's flags directly and should be used carefully
    to avoid unintended side effects. Performance considerations are minimal as this
    is a simple flag removal operation.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the flags being removed are actually
    set on the unit before removal, so calling it without checking may result in unnecessary
    operations. Also, removing flags may affect NPC interaction behavior if not properly
    handled during quest events or scripted interactions.
