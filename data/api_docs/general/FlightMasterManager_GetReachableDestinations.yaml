  signature: int FlightMasterManager::GetReachableDestinations(Creature * flightMaster)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of reachable flight destinations from a given flight
    master creature.
  description: The GetReachableDestinations method calculates and returns the total
    count of flight paths that are currently accessible to a player from the specified
    flight master NPC. This method is used internally by the game's flight path system
    to determine which destinations should be displayed in the player's flight map
    interface. The method evaluates various conditions such as quest completion, faction
    standing, and player level requirements to filter out unreachable destinations.
    It does not modify any state and is typically called when a player interacts with
    a flight master to open their flight path menu.
  parameters:
  - name: flightMaster
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the flight master NPC
      from which to retrieve reachable destinations. Must be a valid flight master
      creature instance; null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the number of flight destinations
    that are currently reachable for the player associated with the active session.
    A return value of zero indicates no destinations are available, while positive
    values indicate the count of accessible flight paths.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Creature* flightMaster = ...; // obtained from player interaction\nint\
      \ reachableCount = sFlightMasterManager->GetReachableDestinations(flightMaster);\n\
      if (reachableCount > 0)\n{\n    // Display flight paths to player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Flight Path Display
    code: "void Player::SendFlightPaths()\n{\n    Creature* flightMaster = GetSelectedUnit();\n\
      \    if (flightMaster && flightMaster->IsFlightMaster())\n    {\n        int\
      \ count = sFlightMasterManager->GetReachableDestinations(flightMaster);\n  \
      \      if (count > 0)\n        {\n            // Proceed to display flight paths\n\
      \            SendFlightPathList(flightMaster, count);\n        }\n        else\n\
      \        {\n            // No reachable destinations\n            SendNoFlightPathsMessage();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the current player's session data and quest completion
    status to determine reachability. It may return different values depending on
    the player's progress in the game world. The implementation internally uses cached
    flight path data for performance optimization, so changes to flight path availability
    may not be immediately reflected if caching is enabled.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid Creature object that is not a flight
    master will result in undefined behavior and potential crashes. Always validate
    the input parameter before calling this method. The returned count does not guarantee
    that all destinations are accessible in the same session, as some may require
    specific conditions to be met at the time of travel.
