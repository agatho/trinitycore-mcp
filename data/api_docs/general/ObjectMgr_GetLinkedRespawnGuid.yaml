  method: GetLinkedRespawnGuid
  signature: int ObjectMgr::GetLinkedRespawnGuid(int spawnId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUID of the linked respawn object for a given spawn ID.
  description: The GetLinkedRespawnGuid method is used to fetch the unique identifier
    (GUID) of an object that is linked to a specific spawn ID within the TrinityCore
    world database. This functionality is typically employed in respawn mechanics
    where certain game objects or creatures are associated with a linked respawn point,
    ensuring proper tracking and restoration of game state upon respawn events. The
    method operates on internal data structures maintained by ObjectMgr, which maps
    spawn identifiers to their corresponding respawn GUIDs. It's commonly used during
    zone loading, respawn handling, and object state management within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the linked respawn object.
    If no linked respawn is found for the given spawn ID, the method may return 0
    or a negative value indicating an invalid or missing link.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int spawnId = 12345;\nint linkedGuid = sObjectMgr->GetLinkedRespawnGuid(spawnId);\n\
      if (linkedGuid > 0)\n{\n    // Process the linked respawn GUID\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      server.loading\", \"Found linked respawn GUID: %u for spawn ID: %d\", linkedGuid,\
      \ spawnId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal object management system and
    relies on pre-loaded spawn data from the database. The returned GUID can be used
    to locate and manipulate the corresponding game object in memory. Performance-wise,
    this lookup should be relatively fast as it uses indexed data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spawnId is valid and corresponds to an existing
    spawn entry in the database; otherwise, the method may return invalid or unexpected
    results. This method should not be called during critical sections of code where
    database locks might cause deadlocks.
