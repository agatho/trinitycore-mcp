  signature: bool BotSpawner::CanSpawnOnMap(uint32 mapId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether bots can be spawned on a specified map.
  description: The CanSpawnOnMap method checks if bot spawning is allowed for a given
    map ID. This functionality is typically used within the BotSpawner class to validate
    whether a particular map supports bot deployment. The method likely evaluates
    internal configuration settings, map restrictions, or game rules that govern where
    bots can be created. It serves as a gatekeeping mechanism to ensure bots are only
    spawned in appropriate environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if bots are allowed to spawn on the specified map; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if bots can spawn on Map ID 0 (Eastern Kingdoms)
    code: "if (botSpawner->CanSpawnOnMap(0)) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawning logic\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Bots can spawn on map 0\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Bots cannot spawn on map 0\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other bot spawning logic to
    enforce game rules and prevent invalid bot placements. It may internally reference
    configuration files or database entries that define allowed maps for bot deployment.
