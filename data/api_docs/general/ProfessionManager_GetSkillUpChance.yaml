  class: ProfessionManager
  method: GetSkillUpChance
  signature: float ProfessionManager::GetSkillUpChance(int * player, const RecipeInfo
    & recipe) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the chance a player has to successfully increase their skill level
    when crafting a recipe.
  description: The GetSkillUpChance method computes the probability that a player
    will gain skill points when attempting to craft a specific recipe. This calculation
    takes into account various factors such as the player's current skill level, the
    recipe's required skill level, and any applicable modifiers or bonuses. The result
    is returned as a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 represents
    no chance of success and 1.0 indicates guaranteed success. This method is typically
    used during crafting operations to determine whether a skill point should be awarded
    upon successful completion of a recipe.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose skill level and attributes are
      considered in the calculation. Must not be null.
  - name: recipe
    description: Reference to the RecipeInfo structure containing details about the
      recipe being crafted, including required skill levels and other relevant properties.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the probability of successfully
    increasing the player's skill level when crafting the specified recipe.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float chance = professionManager.GetSkillUpChance(&player, recipeInfo);\n\
      if (chance > 0.5f) {\n    // Player has a good chance of gaining skill\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Skill Chance Calculation with Debug Output
    code: 'const RecipeInfo* recipe = sRecipeMgr->GetRecipeInfo(12345);

      float chance = professionManager.GetSkillUpChance(&player, *recipe);

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("custom", "Skill up chance for recipe %u is %.2f%%", recipe->Id,
      chance * 100.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal game mechanics and may be influenced by player
    buffs, talents, or other temporary modifiers that affect crafting success rates.
    The exact formula used for calculation is determined by the TrinityCore implementation
    and may vary based on patch versions.
  warnings: Ensure that both the player pointer and recipe reference are valid before
    calling this method; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The returned value
    should not be directly used in conditional logic without proper validation.
