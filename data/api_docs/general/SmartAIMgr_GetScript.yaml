  method: GetScript
  signature: SmartAIEventList SmartAIMgr::GetScript(int32 entry, SmartScriptType type)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the SmartAI event list for a given entry and script type.
  description: The GetScript method retrieves a SmartAIEventList associated with a
    specific entry and script type from the SmartAI manager. This function is used
    to access predefined AI scripts that control creature behavior in TrinityCore.
    The method looks up the script based on the provided entry identifier and script
    type, returning the corresponding event list that defines how the AI should respond
    to various triggers. It's commonly used during AI initialization or when a creature
    needs to execute specific scripted behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The unique identifier of the creature or game object entry for which
      to retrieve the SmartAI script. This corresponds to the entry field in creature_template
      or gameobject_template tables.
  - name: type
    description: The SmartScriptType enum value indicating the type of script to retrieve.
      This determines which category of AI events should be returned, such as creature
      AI, game object AI, or event AI scripts.
  returns: Returns a SmartAIEventList containing all the AI events and actions associated
    with the specified entry and script type. If no script is found for the given
    parameters, an empty SmartAIEventList is returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Creature AI Script
    code: "SmartAIEventList creatureScript = sSmartAIMgr->GetScript(12345, SMART_SCRIPT_TYPE_CREATURE);\n\
      if (!creatureScript.empty()) {\n    // Process the creature's AI events\n  \
      \  for (auto& event : creatureScript) {\n        // Handle each event\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check and Use Game Object Script
    code: "SmartAIEventList gameObjectScript = sSmartAIMgr->GetScript(67890, SMART_SCRIPT_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT);\n\
      if (gameObjectScript.size() > 0) {\n    // Apply the game object AI script\n\
      \    for (auto& event : gameObjectScript) {\n        // Execute event actions\n\
      \    }\n} else {\n    // No script found - use default behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in the SmartAI manager's internal data structures.
    The returned SmartAIEventList should not be modified directly as it may affect
    other creatures using the same script. The method is thread-safe for read operations
    but modifications to the underlying script data should be done carefully.
  warnings: Be aware that returning an empty SmartAIEventList does not indicate an
    error - it simply means no script was found for the specified entry and type combination.
    Always check if the returned list is empty before processing events.
