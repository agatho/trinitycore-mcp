  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: CalculateRageDecay
  signature: float ResourceCalculator::CalculateRageDecay(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the decay rate of rage for a player based on game mechanics and
    time elapsed.
  description: The CalculateRageDecay method computes the amount of rage that decays
    from a player's resource pool over time. This function is typically invoked in
    the context of combat or resource management systems within TrinityCore's framework.
    It takes into account various factors such as player class, equipped items, buffs,
    and debuffs that may influence rage decay. The result represents a float value
    indicating the rate at which rage diminishes per second or tick, depending on
    the implementation details. This method is essential for maintaining accurate
    resource tracking in World of Warcraft-style gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or internal
      index within the game system. This parameter is used to retrieve player-specific
      data such as class, equipment, and active effects that affect rage decay calculations.
  returns: A float value representing the rate of rage decay per second or tick. Positive
    values indicate how much rage is lost over time; typically ranges from 0.0f (no
    decay) to a positive decimal depending on player state and game conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      float decayRate = calculator.CalculateRageDecay(&playerId);

      printf("Rage decay rate: %.2f\n", decayRate);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat System
    code: "class Player {\npublic:\n    int id;\n    float currentRage;\n    ResourceCalculator\
      \ calc;\n    void UpdateRage() {\n        float decay = calc.CalculateRageDecay(&id);\n\
      \        currentRage -= decay * 1.0f; // Assuming 1 second tick\n        if\
      \ (currentRage < 0) currentRage = 0;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player state tracking and may
    be called frequently during combat updates. The exact formula for rage decay might
    vary based on class-specific mechanics, such as Warrior's Berserker Stance or
    Rogue's energy management. Developers should consider caching results if this
    function is invoked repeatedly in tight loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    player object; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The returned rage decay
    rate should be carefully applied in timing-sensitive contexts like combat systems
    to avoid synchronization issues.
