  class: SmartScriptHolder
  method: GetTargetType
  signature: uint32 SmartScriptHolder::GetTargetType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target type identifier used by SmartAI scripts for determining
    valid target entities.
  description: The GetTargetType method returns a unique numeric identifier that defines
    the type of target entity this SmartScriptHolder is configured to interact with.
    In TrinityCore's SmartAI system, target types determine which entities (such as
    players, creatures, game objects, or self) can be selected as targets for actions
    and events. This value is typically set during script initialization and influences
    how the AI evaluates and selects targets based on predefined rules. The method
    provides read-only access to this internal configuration parameter, ensuring that
    SmartAI scripts can correctly identify and validate target selection criteria
    without modifying the underlying data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the target type identifier. Common values include
    SMART_TARGET_TYPE_SELF (0), SMART_TARGET_TYPE_CREATURE (1), SMART_TARGET_TYPE_PLAYER
    (2), SMART_TARGET_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT (3), and others defined in the SmartAI target
    type enumeration system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Target Type
    code: "SmartScriptHolder* holder = ...;\nuint32 targetType = holder->GetTargetType();\n\
      if (targetType == SMART_TARGET_TYPE_PLAYER)\n{\n    // Script is configured\
      \ to target players\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Target Type in Conditional Logic
    code: "SmartScriptHolder* holder = ...;\nuint32 targetType = holder->GetTargetType();\n\
      switch (targetType)\n{\n    case SMART_TARGET_TYPE_SELF:\n        // Handle\
      \ self-targeting logic\n        break;\n    case SMART_TARGET_TYPE_CREATURE:\n\
      \        // Handle creature targeting logic\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Handle other target types\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartScriptHolder class which encapsulates AI
    script configurations in TrinityCore. The returned value corresponds to predefined
    constants defined in the SMART_TARGET_TYPE enumeration, and should be used in
    conjunction with other SmartAI methods for complete scripting functionality.
