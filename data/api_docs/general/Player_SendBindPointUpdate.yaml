  brief: Sends a bind point update packet to the player's client
  description: The SendBindPointUpdate method is responsible for transmitting the
    player's current binding location information to their client. This method is
    typically invoked when a player's bind point changes, such as when they enter
    a new zone or when they bind to a new location. The update ensures that the client
    displays the correct bind point in the UI and that the player can properly utilize
    the /bind command. This method does not directly modify any internal state but
    rather sends a network packet to inform the client of the current binding status.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a quest completion handler
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    // Update\
      \ bind point after completing a quest that changes location\n    player->SendBindPointUpdate();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core when binding points
    change. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing custom
    binding logic or debugging client synchronization issues.
