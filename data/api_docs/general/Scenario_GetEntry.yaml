  class: Scenario
  method: GetEntry
  signature: const ScenarioEntry * Scenario::GetEntry() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the scenario entry data associated with this scenario instance.
  description: The GetEntry method returns a pointer to the ScenarioEntry structure
    that contains static configuration data for the scenario. This entry defines the
    scenario's properties such as its name, type, required items, and other fixed
    attributes. The returned pointer is const, meaning it should not be modified.
    The method is typically used to access scenario metadata during runtime without
    needing to perform additional lookups or database queries.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the ScenarioEntry structure that defines this scenario's
    static properties. Returns nullptr if the scenario has no valid entry data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Scenario Name
    code: "Scenario* scenario = player->GetScenario();\nif (scenario)\n{\n    const\
      \ ScenarioEntry* entry = scenario->GetEntry();\n    if (entry)\n    {\n    \
      \    sLog->outString(\"Scenario: %s\", entry->Name);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Scenario Type
    code: "Scenario* scenario = player->GetScenario();\nif (scenario)\n{\n    const\
      \ ScenarioEntry* entry = scenario->GetEntry();\n    if (entry && entry->Type\
      \ == SCENARIO_TYPE_QUEST)\n    {\n        // Handle quest-based scenario logic\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns cached data from the scenario's
    internal state. It does not perform any expensive operations or database access.
    The returned ScenarioEntry pointer remains valid for the lifetime of the scenario
    object.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if the scenario was not properly initialized
    or if there is no corresponding entry in the database. Always check for null before
    dereferencing the returned pointer to avoid crashes.
