documentation:
  brief: Returns the localized name of the game object for a specific locale.
  description: This method retrieves the localized name of a GameObject instance for
    the specified locale constant. It is used to obtain the display name of game objects
    in different languages, which is essential for proper localization and user experience
    in World of Warcraft. The method accesses the internal name data stored in the
    GameObject's database record and returns the appropriate localized string based
    on the provided locale. This functionality is particularly important when dealing
    with game object templates that have multiple localized names.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::string containing the localized name of the GameObject for
    the specified locale. If no localized name exists for the given locale, it returns
    an empty string.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      std::string name = go->GetNameForLocaleIdx(LocaleConstant::LOCALE_en);

      // Returns the English name of the game object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other localization functions
    to provide proper language support for game objects. It accesses internal data
    structures that store localized names, making it thread-safe when used properly.
    Performance considerations include avoiding repeated calls for the same locale
    unless necessary.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return an empty
    string if no localized name exists for the specified locale. Ensure proper validation
    of the returned string before use in display contexts.
