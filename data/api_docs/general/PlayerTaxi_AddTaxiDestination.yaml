  class: PlayerTaxi

  signature: void PlayerTaxi::AddTaxiDestination(uint32 dest)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a taxi destination to the player's taxi path.
  description: The AddTaxiDestination method adds a specified taxi destination to
    the player's current taxi path. This method is typically used during flight path
    traversal to append new waypoints to the player's journey. The destination is
    identified by its unique identifier (dest), which corresponds to a node in the
    taxi system. When called, this method updates the internal state of the player's
    taxi path, allowing them to continue their travel along the defined route. This
    functionality is integral to the World of Warcraft's taxi system and is usually
    invoked automatically during flight path execution.
  parameters:
  - name: dest
    description: The unique identifier of the taxi destination node to add to the
      player's taxi path. This value must correspond to a valid taxi node in the game's
      database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Taxi Destination
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      player->GetTaxi().AddTaxiDestination(12345);

      // Adds taxi destination with ID 12345 to the player''s current flight path'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the player's taxi path. It should
    only be called when the player is in a valid flight path state. The destination
    ID must exist in the game's taxi database, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid destination ID may cause unexpected
    behavior or errors during flight path execution. Ensure that all destination IDs
    are validated before calling this method.
