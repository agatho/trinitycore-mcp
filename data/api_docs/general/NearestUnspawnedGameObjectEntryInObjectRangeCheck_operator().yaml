    * go)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a game object entry is unspawned within the specified range of
    an object.
  description: The NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck::operator() method
    evaluates whether a given game object entry is currently unspawned and located
    within a defined range from a reference object. This check is typically used in
    AI or quest systems to locate nearby unspawned game objects for interaction, spawning,
    or triggering events. The method returns true if the object meets the criteria
    of being unspawned and within range, otherwise false. It operates as part of a
    predicate functor mechanism, often employed in container searches or range-based
    queries.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the game object entry is unspawned and within the specified
    range; false otherwise.

  - title: Basic Usage in Object Search
    code: 'NearestUnspawnedGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck checker(12345, player,
      50.0f);

      bool found = checker(&gameObjectEntry);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI and quest logic to find
    unspawned game objects for interaction. It assumes the presence of a valid reference
    object (like a player or creature) and a defined search range.
