documentation:
  brief: Checks if the hunter's pet requires healing and applies the Mend Pet spell
    if necessary.
  description: The MendPetIfNeeded method evaluates the current health status of the
    hunter's pet and determines whether it needs to be healed using the Mend Pet ability.
    This method is typically called during AI decision-making processes to ensure
    that the pet remains in optimal combat condition. It checks if the pet's health
    is below a certain threshold and, if so, casts Mend Pet on the pet. The behavior
    may vary slightly depending on the hunter's specialization and available resources
    such as focus or mana. This method does not directly handle spell casting logic
    but rather serves as a decision point for when to initiate healing.

  returns: null

    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      \    _hunter->MendPetIfNeeded();\n    // Continue with other actions...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the hunter has a valid pet in the game world. It
    is recommended to check for pet existence before calling this method to prevent
    errors. The method internally uses the hunter's current focus or mana to determine
    if Mend Pet can be cast, so it should only be called when appropriate resources
    are available.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that a pet exists may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes in the AI system. Additionally, frequent calls to this method
    without proper cooldown management could result in resource exhaustion or performance
    degradation.
