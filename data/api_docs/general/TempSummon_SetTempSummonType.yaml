  class: TempSummon
  method: SetTempSummonType
  signature: void TempSummon::SetTempSummonType(int type)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the temporary summon type for a summoned creature or NPC.
  description: The SetTempSummonType method configures the behavior and lifecycle
    of a temporary summoned unit. This method determines how the summon will behave
    after its initial spawning, such as whether it should despawn after a certain
    time, follow the caster, or remain active until explicitly removed. The summon
    type affects the AI behavior, duration management, and cleanup process of the
    summoned creature within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: 'An integer value representing the summon type. Valid values typically
      include: 0 = TEMPSUMMON_MANUAL_DESPAWN (despawns when explicitly commanded),
      1 = TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN (despawns after a set duration), 2 = TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_OOC_DESPAWN
      (despawns after a set duration if out of combat), 3 = TEMPSUMMON_CORPSE_DESPAWN
      (despawns when corpse expires), 4 = TEMPSUMMON_DEAD_DESPAWN (despawns when unit
      dies), 5 = TEMPSUMMON_CASTER_DEATH (despawns when caster dies).'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a timed despawn summon
    code: 'TempSummon* summon = caster->SummonCreature(12345, position, TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN,
      60000);

      summon->SetTempSummonType(TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a manual despawn summon
    code: 'Creature* summoned = caster->SummonCreature(54321, position, TEMPSUMMON_MANUAL_DESPAWN);

      summoned->ToTempSummon()->SetTempSummonType(TEMPSUMMON_MANUAL_DESPAWN);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called immediately after summoning a creature to ensure
    proper behavior. The summon type affects how the game handles cleanup and AI decisions
    for the summoned unit.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the summon type may cause unexpected behavior such
    as creatures not despawning properly or remaining in the world indefinitely. Ensure
    that the summon type matches the intended gameplay behavior.
