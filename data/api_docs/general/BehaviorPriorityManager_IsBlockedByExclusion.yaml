  class: BehaviorPriorityManager
  method: IsBlockedByExclusion
  signature: bool BehaviorPriorityManager::IsBlockedByExclusion(BehaviorPriority priority,
    const int & activePriorities) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a behavior priority is blocked by active exclusions.
  description: The IsBlockedByExclusion method evaluates if a given behavior priority
    is currently blocked due to active exclusion rules. This functionality is typically
    used in AI systems where certain behaviors should not execute simultaneously or
    when specific conditions prevent a behavior from being prioritized. The method
    checks against a bitmask of active priorities to determine if the specified priority
    conflicts with any currently active exclusions.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The behavior priority to check for exclusion blocking. This value
      represents a specific behavior or action that may be restricted by active exclusions.
  - name: activePriorities
    description: A bitmask representing currently active priorities. Each bit in this
      integer corresponds to a specific behavior priority, indicating whether it is
      currently active and potentially blocking other behaviors.
  returns: Returns true if the specified behavior priority is blocked by active exclusions;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates that the behavior cannot
    be executed at this time due to conflicting active priorities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a priority is blocked
    code: 'BehaviorPriorityManager manager;

      BehaviorPriority myPriority = BehaviorPriority::Attack;

      int activePriorities = static_cast<int>(BehaviorPriority::Move) | static_cast<int>(BehaviorPriority::Defend);

      bool isBlocked = manager.IsBlockedByExclusion(myPriority, activePriorities);

      // isBlocked will be true if Attack is excluded by Move or Defend'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that behavior priorities are represented as bits in an
    integer bitmask. The implementation likely uses bitwise operations to efficiently
    check exclusion relationships without iterating through all possible priority
    combinations.
