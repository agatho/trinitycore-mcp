  class: QuestSelectionStrategy
  method: SetStrategy
  signature: void QuestSelectionStrategy::SetStrategy(Strategy strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the quest selection strategy for the AI to use when choosing quests.
  description: The SetStrategy method configures the QuestSelectionStrategy class
    to utilize a specific strategy for selecting which quests to pursue. This method
    allows the AI to dynamically adapt its quest selection behavior based on predefined
    strategies such as prioritizing high-value rewards, avoiding duplicate quests,
    or following a sequential progression. The strategy determines how the AI evaluates
    and ranks available quests in the context of player progression and game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: strategy
    description: The Strategy enum value that defines the quest selection approach
      to be used. Valid values typically include options like HIGH_VALUE, SEQUENTIAL,
      RANDOM, or AVOID_DUPLICATES depending on the implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting High Value Quest Strategy
    code: 'QuestSelectionStrategy strategy;

      strategy.SetStrategy(Strategy::HIGH_VALUE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Sequential Quest Selection
    code: 'QuestSelectionStrategy aiStrategy;

      aiStrategy.SetStrategy(Strategy::SEQUENTIAL);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization or when the quest
    selection behavior needs to be dynamically adjusted. The strategy may affect performance
    if complex evaluation logic is implemented for certain strategies.
  warnings: Ensure that the Strategy enum value passed is valid and supported by the
    current implementation, as invalid values might lead to undefined behavior or
    default strategy application.
