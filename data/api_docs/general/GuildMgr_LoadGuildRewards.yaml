documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all guild reward data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadGuildRewards method is responsible for retrieving all configured
    guild rewards from the database and caching them in memory for efficient access
    during gameplay. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when
    the guild system is initialized to ensure that all reward definitions are available.
    It processes reward entries such as item rewards, gold rewards, and other benefits
    that guild members can earn based on their guild level or achievements. The loaded
    data is stored internally within the GuildMgr class for quick lookup when players
    interact with guild reward systems.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadGuildData()\n{\n    sGuildMgr->LoadGuildRewards();\n  \
      \  // Other guild initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization to avoid
    redundant database queries. It is thread-safe and does not require external synchronization.
    The method assumes that the database connection is already established and functional.
