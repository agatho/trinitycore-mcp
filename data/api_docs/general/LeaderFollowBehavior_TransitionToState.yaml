  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: TransitionToState
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::TransitionToState(FollowState newState)
documentation:
  brief: Transitions the leader-follower behavior to a new state, updating internal
    state tracking and triggering relevant actions.
  description: The TransitionToState method is responsible for changing the current
    state of a LeaderFollowBehavior instance. This method updates the internal FollowState
    enumeration value and may trigger associated actions or callbacks based on the
    state transition. The behavior typically manages the relationship between a leader
    (such as a player) and followers (like pets or companions), handling different
    states such as following, stopping, or pausing. It ensures that the AI system
    properly responds to changes in the follower's behavioral mode and maintains consistency
    with the game's movement and interaction systems.
  parameters:
  - name: newState
    description: The target FollowState enum value to transition to. Valid values
      typically include states like FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOW, FOLLOW_STATE_STOP, or FOLLOW_STATE_PAUSE
      depending on the implementation. This parameter determines what actions are
      taken during the transition and how the behavior will operate going forward.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Transition
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = ...;

      behavior->TransitionToState(FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOW);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stopping Follower Behavior
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = ...;

      behavior->TransitionToState(FOLLOW_STATE_STOP);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system or through direct
    interaction with a creature's behavior manager. It may perform internal validation
    to ensure state transitions are valid and consistent with game logic. The implementation
    might also trigger events or callbacks to notify other systems about the state
    change.
