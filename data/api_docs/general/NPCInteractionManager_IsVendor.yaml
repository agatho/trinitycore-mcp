  method: IsVendor
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::IsVendor(Creature * npc) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature is a vendor NPC.
  description: The IsVendor method checks if the provided Creature object represents
    a vendor NPC within the World of Warcraft game environment. This method evaluates
    the creature's flags, npcflags, and other relevant attributes to determine if
    it can sell items to players. It is commonly used in NPC interaction logic to
    route player requests appropriately based on the type of NPC they are interacting
    with. The method performs a straightforward lookup without requiring additional
    data fetching or complex computations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is a vendor (i.e., has vendor flags set),
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Check
    code: "if (interactionManager.IsVendor(npc)) {\n    // Handle vendor-specific\
      \ interaction\n    player->GetSession()->SendListInventory(npc->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Vendor Interaction
    code: "Creature* target = player->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith();\nif (target && interactionManager.IsVendor(target))\
      \ {\n    // Open vendor window\n    player->GetSession()->SendListInventory(target->GetGUID());\n\
      } else if (target) {\n    // Handle other NPC types\n    player->OnNPCInteraction(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the Creature's npcflags field, specifically checking
    for the VENDOR_FLAG bit. It does not validate whether the vendor has any items
    available for sale; that check would need to be performed separately. The method
    is lightweight and suitable for frequent calls during player-NPC interaction handling.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null before calling, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior.
    This method should only be called on creatures that are confirmed to be interactable
    NPCs.
