  class: QuestTrigger
  method: QuestTrigger
  signature: void QuestTrigger::QuestTrigger(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a quest trigger with the specified name.
  description: The QuestTrigger constructor initializes a quest trigger object with
    the given name. This method sets up the internal state of the quest trigger, allowing
    it to be associated with specific quest events or conditions within the TrinityCore
    framework. The name parameter is used to uniquely identify the trigger within
    the quest system and is typically derived from quest-related identifiers or event
    names. This initialization is a prerequisite for using the quest trigger in game
    logic and quest completion checks.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier name for this quest trigger. This string is
      used to associate the trigger with specific quest events and must be non-empty
      to ensure proper functionality within the TrinityCore quest system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Trigger Initialization
    code: QuestTrigger trigger("quest_complete_event");
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Multiple Quest Triggers
    code: 'QuestTrigger trigger1("kill_mob_1");

      QuestTrigger trigger2("collect_item_1");

      QuestTrigger trigger3("talk_to_npc_1");'
    language: cpp
  notes: The QuestTrigger constructor does not perform any validation on the input
    name parameter. It is recommended that developers ensure the name is unique and
    follows naming conventions used by the TrinityCore quest system to prevent conflicts
    or unexpected behavior in quest completion logic.
