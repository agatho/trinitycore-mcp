documentation:
  brief: Returns the animation state ID used for empty or default animations in the
    game.
  description: The GetEmptyAnimStateID method retrieves a unique identifier that corresponds
    to an empty or default animation state within the TrinityCore database. This ID
    is typically used when an object or unit does not have a specific animation assigned
    and needs to fall back to a neutral or default animation state. The value returned
    by this method is often utilized in animation systems, particularly for creatures,
    game objects, or player characters where no custom animation is defined. It ensures
    consistency across the game's animation system by providing a standardized fallback
    animation ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier (ID) of the empty or
    default animation state in the DB2 files. This ID can be used to reference predefined
    animation entries within the game's animation database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving and Using Empty Animation State ID
    code: 'uint32 emptyAnimStateId = sDB2Manager->GetEmptyAnimStateID();

      // Use the ID to set a default animation for a creature

      creature->SetAnimationState(emptyAnimStateId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the DB2Manager class, which handles loading and accessing
    data from the DB2 format files used in World of Warcraft. The returned ID should
    be treated as a constant value once loaded and is typically initialized during
    server startup or database loading phases.
