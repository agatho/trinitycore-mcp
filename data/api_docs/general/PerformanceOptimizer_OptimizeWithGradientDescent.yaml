  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: OptimizeWithGradientDescent
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::OptimizeWithGradientDescent(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Performs gradient descent optimization on bot performance metrics using the
    specified bot's GUID.
  description: The OptimizeWithGradientDescent method applies a gradient descent algorithm
    to improve the performance of a specific bot identified by its GUID. This method
    is typically used in AI-driven systems within TrinityCore to iteratively adjust
    parameters that influence bot behavior, such as decision-making thresholds or
    movement patterns. It modifies internal performance metrics and may update the
    bot's configuration based on calculated gradients. The optimization process assumes
    the existence of a defined performance landscape with measurable outcomes for
    each parameter set. This method should only be called when the bot is in a stable
    state and ready for tuning.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.OptimizeWithGradientDescent(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be non-blocking and should not interfere with
    ongoing bot operations. It internally manages its own thread safety for performance
    metrics access.
  warnings: Calling this method on a bot that is currently in combat or performing
    critical tasks may lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure the bot is idle before
    invoking this optimization routine.
