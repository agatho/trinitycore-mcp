documentation:
  brief: Updates the despawn behavior of a SmartAI-controlled creature based on elapsed
    time.
  description: The UpdateDespawn method is responsible for managing the automatic
    despawn logic of creatures controlled by SmartAI. It processes the time difference
    (diff) since the last update and determines whether the creature should be removed
    from the world based on configured despawn conditions. This typically involves
    checking if the creature has exceeded its maximum spawn duration or if specific
    events have occurred that trigger immediate despawning. The method is called regularly
    by the game loop to ensure timely removal of creatures when appropriate.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void SmartAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateDespawn(diff);\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the main AI update loop and
    should not be called directly by external code. The despawn timing is usually
    configured via SmartAI scripts or creature templates, and this method simply processes
    those conditions over time.
