  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: SetPathParameters
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::SetPathParameters(uint32 maxNodes, float straightDistance,
    float maxSearchDistance)
documentation:
  brief: Configures pathfinding parameters for navigation calculations.
  description: Sets the maximum number of nodes to explore during pathfinding, the
    straight-line distance threshold for direct path checks, and the maximum search
    distance allowed. This method adjusts core pathfinding behavior to balance performance
    and accuracy. The parameters control how aggressively the system searches for
    paths and when it considers a direct route versus an optimized one. These settings
    are crucial for maintaining efficient AI navigation in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    environment.
  parameters:
  - name: maxNodes
    description: Maximum number of nodes to evaluate during pathfinding search. Higher
      values allow more complex paths but increase computational cost. Typical values
      range from 100-5000 depending on map complexity and performance requirements.
  - name: straightDistance
    description: Minimum straight-line distance threshold for considering a direct
      path instead of searching. If the start and end points are closer than this
      value, the system may skip complex pathfinding calculations. Should be set based
      on game object sizes and navigation mesh resolution.
  - name: maxSearchDistance
    description: Maximum distance allowed for pathfinding searches. Exceeding this
      limit will result in pathfinding failure or fallback behavior. Controls overall
      search scope to prevent excessive computation on large maps.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pathfinding Configuration
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      adapter.SetPathParameters(2000, 10.0f, 50.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance-Oriented Pathfinding Setup
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      // Optimized for performance with lower node count

      adapter.SetPathParameters(500, 5.0f, 25.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating any pathfinding operations
    to ensure proper parameter initialization. The parameters are typically set based
    on the specific map requirements and performance constraints of the running server
    instance. Changes to these parameters may affect AI behavior across different
    zones or encounter types.
  warnings: Setting maxNodes too high can cause performance degradation or stack overflow
    in complex environments. Setting straightDistance too low may force unnecessary
    pathfinding calculations for short distances, while setting it too high may skip
    valid pathfinding for nearby objects. Ensure maxSearchDistance is appropriate
    for your map size to avoid premature pathfinding failures.
