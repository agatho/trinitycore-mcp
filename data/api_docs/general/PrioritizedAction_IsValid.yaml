  signature: bool PrioritizedAction::IsValid(uint32 maxAgeMs) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the prioritized action is valid based on its age threshold
  description: The IsValid method determines whether a PrioritizedAction object remains
    valid by comparing its internal timestamp against the specified maximum age. This
    validation ensures that stale or outdated actions are not processed further in
    the AI system. The method typically checks if the action's age (in milliseconds)
    is less than or equal to the provided maxAgeMs parameter. If the action has exceeded
    the allowed age, it is considered invalid and should be discarded or refreshed.
  parameters:
  - name: maxAgeMs
    description: The maximum allowed age of the action in milliseconds. If the action's
      internal timestamp exceeds this value, the method returns false.
  returns: Returns true if the action is valid (i.e., its age is less than or equal
    to maxAgeMs), otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PrioritizedAction action;

      // ... set up action with timestamp ...

      bool isValid = action.IsValid(5000); // Check if action is valid within 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (action.IsValid(1000)) {\n    // Process the action\n    action.Execute();\n\
      } else {\n    // Discard or requeue the stale action\n    Log(\"Stale action\
      \ discarded\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on an internal timestamp mechanism to determine action
    age. It's important that the PrioritizedAction class properly initializes and
    maintains this timestamp for accurate validation. The maxAgeMs parameter should
    be chosen based on game mechanics and desired responsiveness of AI behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using very small maxAgeMs values as they may cause valid
    actions to be prematurely invalidated, especially in high-latency environments
    or during server maintenance periods. Ensure that the timestamp used for validation
    is updated appropriately when actions are modified.
