  method: RegisterAction
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::RegisterAction(const std::string & actionName)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a new action with the behavior adaptation system for use in AI
    decision making.
  description: The RegisterAction method allows external code to register custom actions
    that can be used by the BehaviorAdaptation system. This enables dynamic extension
    of AI behaviors without modifying core engine code. The registered actions are
    typically used within behavior trees or other AI decision-making frameworks to
    define what actions a creature or NPC can perform. The method does not validate
    whether the action name is unique, so duplicate registrations may lead to unexpected
    behavior. It is expected that this method is called during initialization or setup
    phases of AI systems.
  parameters:
  - name: actionName
    description: The unique identifier string for the action being registered. This
      name will be used to reference the action within the behavior adaptation system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Registration
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* behavior = new BehaviorAdaptation();

      behavior->RegisterAction("attack_target");

      behavior->RegisterAction("move_to_position");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic AI Action Registration
    code: "void InitializeCustomAI()\n{\n    BehaviorAdaptation* ai = GetCreature()->GetBehaviorAdaptation();\n\
      \    ai->RegisterAction(\"cast_spell_fireball\");\n    ai->RegisterAction(\"\
      use_item_health_potion\");\n    ai->RegisterAction(\"flee_from_enemy\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other behavior adaptation
    APIs such as GetAction(), ExecuteAction(), or UpdateAdaptation(). It's important
    to ensure that action names are consistent across the system and do not contain
    special characters that might interfere with internal parsing. The registration
    process itself is lightweight, but repeated calls with identical names may have
    performance implications depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Calling RegisterAction() with an empty string or null pointer could lead
    to undefined behavior. It's recommended to validate action names before registration.
    Also, if multiple systems attempt to register actions simultaneously, thread safety
    should be considered as this method may not be thread-safe.
