  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: SpendPain
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::SpendPain(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Spends the specified amount of pain resource for the Demon Hunter AI.
  description: The SpendPain method is used to deduct a given amount of pain from
    the Demon Hunter's resource pool. This method is typically invoked during ability
    usage or spell casting when the AI needs to consume pain as a cost. Pain is a
    core resource in the Demon Hunter class, used for various abilities and talents.
    The method ensures that the pain spent does not exceed the available pain amount,
    preventing negative values. It may also trigger related events or updates within
    the AI system upon successful pain deduction.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of pain to be spent. Must be a non-negative integer value
      representing the cost of an ability or action.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pain Spending Example
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UseSoulCleave() {\n    if (GetPain() >= 30) {\n   \
      \     SpendPain(30);\n        // Execute Soul Cleave ability\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Pain Spending with Validation
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::CastEyeBeam() {\n    int requiredPain = 50;\n    if\
      \ (GetPain() >= requiredPain) {\n        SpendPain(requiredPain);\n        //\
      \ Cast Eye Beam spell\n    } else {\n        // Handle insufficient pain case\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI has sufficient pain available.
    It is recommended to validate the pain amount before calling this function to
    avoid unexpected behavior or resource depletion issues.
  warnings: Calling SpendPain with a negative value may lead to undefined behavior.
    Always ensure that the amount passed is non-negative and does not exceed the current
    pain pool.
