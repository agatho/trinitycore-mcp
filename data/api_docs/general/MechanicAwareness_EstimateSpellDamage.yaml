api:
  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: EstimateSpellDamage
  signature: float MechanicAwareness::EstimateSpellDamage(uint32 spellId, Unit * caster,
    Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the estimated damage value of a spell based on caster,
    target, and spell properties.
  description: The EstimateSpellDamage method computes an approximate damage output
    for a given spell when cast by a specific unit against a target unit. This estimation
    takes into account various factors such as spell power, base damage, modifiers,
    and mechanic-specific adjustments that may affect the spell's effectiveness. The
    method is typically used in AI decision-making processes or for calculating potential
    threat generation. It does not actually execute the spell but provides a predictive
    value useful for gameplay logic and balancing.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to estimate damage for. Must correspond
      to a valid spell entry in the game database.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is casting the spell. Can be null,
      but will result in undefined behavior if not properly initialized.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being targeted by the spell. Can
      be null, but will result in undefined behavior if not properly initialized.
  returns: A float value representing the estimated damage amount of the spell. Returns
    zero or negative values if the spell cannot deal damage or if invalid parameters
    are provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Damage Estimation
    code: "float damage = mechanicAwareness->EstimateSpellDamage(12345, playerUnit,\
      \ npcTarget);\nif (damage > 0)\n{\n    // Use estimated damage for AI decision\
      \ making\n    printf(\"Estimated damage: %.2f\\n\", damage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Damage Estimation with Null Check
    code: "if (playerUnit && npcTarget)\n{\n    float estimated = mechanicAwareness->EstimateSpellDamage(12345,\
      \ playerUnit, npcTarget);\n    if (estimated > 0)\n    {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with logic based on damage estimate\n        DoAttackLogic(npcTarget, estimated);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve complex calculations including spell modifiers and stat lookups.
    The estimation is not guaranteed to match exact damage output due to randomness,
    critical hits, or other dynamic factors during actual spell execution.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for caster or target will likely result in crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that both units are valid before calling this method.
    Also note that the returned value is an estimate and may not reflect real-world
    damage values precisely.
