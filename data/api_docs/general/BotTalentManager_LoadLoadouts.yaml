  method: LoadLoadouts
  signature: bool BotTalentManager::LoadLoadouts()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all bot talent loadouts from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadLoadouts method retrieves all saved talent loadouts for bot
    characters from the database and populates the internal loadout cache within the
    BotTalentManager. This method is typically called during bot initialization or
    when the talent system needs to refresh its data. It ensures that each bot character
    can access their predefined talent configurations, which are used for talent point
    allocation and specialization management. The method performs database queries
    to fetch loadout data and validates the integrity of the loaded data before caching
    it in memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all loadouts were successfully loaded and validated from
    the database; returns false if any error occurred during the loading process,
    such as database access failures or corrupted data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic LoadLoadouts Usage
    code: "BotTalentManager talentManager;\nbool success = talentManager.LoadLoadouts();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // All loadouts loaded successfully\n    std::cout << \"\
      Talent loadouts loaded successfully.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ loading failure\n    std::cout << \"Failed to load talent loadouts.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a bot system. Repeated calls may result in duplicate entries or memory leaks if
    not properly handled. The method assumes that the database connection is already
    established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method without an active database connection will likely
    result in failure. Additionally, if the database contains malformed or inconsistent
    loadout data, the method may silently skip invalid entries rather than throwing
    exceptions.
