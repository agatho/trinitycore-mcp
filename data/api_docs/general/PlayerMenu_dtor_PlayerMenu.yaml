  class: PlayerMenu
  method: ~PlayerMenu
  signature: void PlayerMenu::~PlayerMenu()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PlayerMenu instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~PlayerMenu destructor is automatically invoked when a PlayerMenu
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal data structures, UI elements, or references held by the
    player menu system. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this typically occurs during player logout, character deletion, or when switching
    between different menu states such as inventory, spellbook, or gossip interactions.
    The destructor performs necessary cleanup to prevent memory leaks and maintain
    system stability.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerMenu
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    // When player goes out\
      \ of scope or is deleted,\n    // ~PlayerMenu is automatically called\n    PlayerMenu*\
      \ menu = player->GetPlayerMenu();\n    // menu will be destroyed here when it\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to understand that PlayerMenu objects are typically
    managed through smart pointers or automatic lifetime management in TrinityCore's
    architecture.
