  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: ApplyPreset
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::ApplyPreset(BotAI * bot, DifficultyPreset preset)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a specified difficulty preset to a bot AI instance for adaptive challenge
    adjustment.
  description: The ApplyPreset method configures a BotAI instance with settings from
    a given DifficultyPreset, adjusting the bot's behavior and challenge level dynamically.
    This method is used in TrinityCore's adaptive difficulty system to ensure bots
    provide appropriate combat challenges based on player progression or game mode.
    The preset defines parameters such as enemy stats, loot distribution, and AI decision-making
    thresholds that influence how the bot behaves during encounters. It modifies internal
    state variables within the BotAI object to reflect these settings, ensuring consistent
    behavior across different gameplay scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance whose difficulty settings will be adjusted.
      Must not be null and should represent a valid bot AI object.
  - name: preset
    description: The DifficultyPreset enum value specifying which set of configuration
      parameters to apply. Valid values typically include NORMAL, HARD, CHALLENGING,
      etc., depending on the implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: AdaptiveDifficulty::ApplyPreset(myBot, DifficultyPreset::HARD);
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Preset Application
    code: "if (player->GetLevel() > 60)\n{\n    AdaptiveDifficulty::ApplyPreset(bot,\
      \ DifficultyPreset::CHALLENGING);\n}\nelse\n{\n    AdaptiveDifficulty::ApplyPreset(bot,\
      \ DifficultyPreset::NORMAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the BotAI object directly. It
    is recommended to call this method before starting combat encounters to ensure
    proper initialization. The implementation may involve recalculating bot stats
    or updating behavior trees based on the preset values.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided BotAI pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Also
    verify that the DifficultyPreset value passed is within the expected range to
    prevent unexpected configuration changes.
