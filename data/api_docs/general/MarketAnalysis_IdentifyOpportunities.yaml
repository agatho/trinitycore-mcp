  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: IdentifyOpportunities
  signature: int MarketAnalysis::IdentifyOpportunities(int * player, uint32 budgetLimit)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market data to identify profitable opportunities for the player.
  description: The IdentifyOpportunities method evaluates current market conditions,
    item prices, and player inventory to determine potential profit-making opportunities
    within the specified budget limit. It scans available items in the auction house,
    compares buyout prices with historical data, and identifies items that are undervalued
    or have high demand. The method uses internal market analysis algorithms to prioritize
    opportunities based on profitability and feasibility. This function is typically
    used by automated trading systems or player advisors to optimize in-game economic
    decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object for whom opportunities are being identified.
      Must not be null.
  - name: budgetLimit
    description: Maximum amount of gold the player is willing to spend on identified
      opportunities. Must be a positive value.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of profitable opportunities
    identified. Returns 0 if no opportunities are found or if the budget is insufficient.
    Returns -1 if an error occurs during analysis.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nint opportunities = marketAnalysis->IdentifyOpportunities(player,\
      \ 1000000); // 1 million gold budget\nif (opportunities > 0) {\n    printf(\"\
      Found %d profitable opportunities\\n\", opportunities);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nint result = marketAnalysis->IdentifyOpportunities(player,\
      \ 500000);\nif (result == -1) {\n    printf(\"Market analysis failed\\n\");\n\
      } else if (result == 0) {\n    printf(\"No profitable opportunities found\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Identified %d opportunities\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs intensive market data processing and may have performance
    implications when called frequently. The analysis considers real-time auction
    house data, historical price trends, and player-specific inventory constraints.
    The budget limit is strictly enforced and will not allow spending beyond the specified
    amount.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the player parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method. The method does not automatically execute trades;
    it only identifies potential opportunities for further action.
