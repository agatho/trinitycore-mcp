documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current statistics for cooldown events managed by the CooldownEventBus.
  description: The GetStatistics method provides access to a snapshot of performance
    and usage metrics related to cooldown events within the CooldownEventBus. This
    includes information such as total events processed, active cooldowns, and processing
    times. The returned Statistics object is immutable and represents data at the
    time of the call. This method is typically used for monitoring, debugging, or
    performance analysis purposes within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a Statistics object containing detailed metrics
    about cooldown event handling, including counts, timing information, and operational
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'const auto& stats = cooldownEventBus.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total events: " << stats.totalEvents << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is read-only and should not be modified. It's
    recommended to cache the result if frequent access is needed, as repeated calls
    may incur performance overhead.
