  signature: int CreatureModelDataEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with a creature model data entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the flags
    that define various properties and behaviors of a creature model in the TrinityCore
    database. These flags are typically used to control how the creature model is
    rendered, whether it's selectable, if it has specific AI behaviors, or other model-related
    attributes. The returned value is a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a specific
    flag. This method is commonly used during creature creation and model initialization
    to determine the appropriate behavior and rendering settings for the creature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of flags associated with the creature
    model data entry. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific flag
    that defines properties such as model visibility, selectable status, AI behavior,
    or other model-specific attributes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CreatureModelDataEntry* modelData = sCreatureModelDataStore.GetEntry(12345);\n\
      if (modelData)\n{\n    int flags = modelData->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & 0x1)\
      \ // Check if first flag is set\n    {\n        // Handle special model behavior\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Specific Flags
    code: "CreatureModelDataEntry* modelData = sCreatureModelDataStore.GetEntry(54321);\n\
      if (modelData)\n{\n    int flags = modelData->GetFlags();\n    bool isSelectable\
      \ = (flags & 0x2) != 0;\n    bool hasSpecialAI = (flags & 0x8) != 0;\n    \n\
      \    if (isSelectable)\n        // Apply selectable logic\n    if (hasSpecialAI)\n\
      \        // Apply special AI behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are defined in the creature_model_data.dbc
    file and are interpreted according to the TrinityCore engine's internal flag definitions.
    Developers should consult the DBC documentation or source code to understand the
    meaning of individual bits. The returned value is read-only and represents static
    data from the database.
  warnings: Be aware that flag values may change between different versions of TrinityCore
    or custom modifications. Always verify that your flag checks are compatible with
    the specific version of the core you're working with. Also, since this method
    returns a bitmask, bitwise operations should be used to check individual flags
    rather than direct equality comparisons.
