api:
  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: HasReachedStockpileTarget
  signature: bool FarmingCoordinator::HasReachedStockpileTarget(int * player, uint32
    itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player has reached their stockpile target for a specific
    item.
  description: The HasReachedStockpileTarget method evaluates if a given player has
    accumulated enough of a specified item to meet their defined stockpile target.
    This method is typically used in farming or resource management systems within
    the game to track progress toward inventory goals. It checks the current quantity
    of the item in the player's possession against a predetermined target value, which
    may be configured per-player or globally. The method returns true if the target
    has been met or exceeded, and false otherwise. This functionality is essential
    for quests, achievements, or automated farming systems that require players to
    gather specific quantities of items.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter identifies which player's inventory and stockpile target
      are being evaluated.
  - name: itemId
    description: A unique identifier for the item type being checked. This value corresponds
      to the item's entry in the game's database and determines what specific resource
      is being tracked.
  returns: Returns true if the player has reached or exceeded their stockpile target
    for the specified item; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check stockpile target
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 itemId = 12345;\nbool reachedTarget = coordinator.HasReachedStockpileTarget(&playerId,\
      \ itemId);\nif (reachedTarget) {\n    // Player has met the stockpile target\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a farming quest system
    code: "void CheckFarmingProgress(Player* player) {\n    uint32 itemId = 54321;\
      \ // Example item ID for wheat\n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    if (coordinator.HasReachedStockpileTarget(&playerId, itemId)) {\n     \
      \   player->CompleteQuest(QUEST_FARMING_GOAL);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player data structures and may
    involve database lookups to retrieve current item counts and target values. Performance
    considerations should be taken into account when calling this method frequently,
    especially in loops or during high-frequency updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an active player
    object before calling this method. Passing a null or invalid GUID may lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes.
