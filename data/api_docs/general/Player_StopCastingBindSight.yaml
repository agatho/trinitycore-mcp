documentation:
  brief: Stops the player's bind sight casting spell
  description: This method terminates the bind sight casting process for the player,
    which is typically used in conjunction with the Bind Sight spell to allow players
    to see through the eyes of their target. The method ensures that any ongoing cast
    is interrupted and removes the player from the casting state. This functionality
    is commonly used during quest completion or when a player needs to break free
    from a bind sight effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->StopCastingBindSight();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when the player needs to cancel a bind sight
    spell, typically during quest completion or when the player is no longer able
    to see through their target's eyes. It is important to note that this method does
    not directly remove the Bind Sight effect from the target but rather stops the
    casting process.
  warnings: This method should only be used in appropriate contexts as it may interrupt
    ongoing quest-related activities or player actions. Calling this method without
    proper context can lead to unexpected behavior during quest completion or player
    interaction.
