  signature: void BotPriorityManager::SetMaxBotsPerPriority(BotPriority priority,
    uint32 maxBots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bots allowed for a specified priority level
  description: Configures the upper limit of bots that can be assigned to a specific
    priority level within the bot management system. This method allows administrators
    or game systems to control resource allocation and bot distribution across different
    priority tiers. The setting takes effect immediately and affects all subsequent
    bot assignments. Priorities are typically used to manage bot behavior, such as
    assigning more bots to high-priority tasks like PvP combat or quest completion.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The BotPriority enum value specifying which priority level to configure.
      Valid values include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and others depending on the implementation.
  - name: maxBots
    description: The maximum number of bots allowed for the specified priority level.
      Must be a non-negative integer. Setting this to 0 effectively disables bot assignment
      for that priority.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Maximum Bots for High Priority
    code: BotPriorityManager::instance()->SetMaxBotsPerPriority(BotPriority::HIGH,
      10);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Low Priority Bot Assignment
    code: BotPriorityManager::instance()->SetMaxBotsPerPriority(BotPriority::LOW,
      0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or configuration
    updates. Changes made at runtime may affect active bot assignments immediately.
    The implementation likely uses internal data structures to track priority limits
    and enforce them during bot creation or assignment processes.
  warnings: Setting maxBots to 0 for a priority level will prevent any new bots from
    being assigned to that priority, which might impact gameplay if not carefully
    planned. Ensure that priority configurations align with overall server resource
    management strategies.
