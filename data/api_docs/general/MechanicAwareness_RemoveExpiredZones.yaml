documentation:
  brief: Removes expired zones from the MechanicAwareness system based on the provided
    current time.
  description: The RemoveExpiredZones method is responsible for cleaning up and removing
    zone entries that have exceeded their valid duration within the MechanicAwareness
    system. This method iterates through the internal collection of active zones and
    removes those whose expiration time has passed relative to the given current time
    parameter. It ensures that stale or outdated zone data does not persist in memory,
    which is crucial for maintaining performance and accuracy in game mechanics related
    to player awareness and environmental effects. The method operates on a time-based
    eviction policy where each zone entry contains an associated expiration timestamp.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 currentTime = sWorld->GetGameTime();

      mechanicAwareness->RemoveExpiredZones(currentTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically, typically during game tick processing
    or at regular intervals, to maintain clean state. The internal zone tracking mechanism
    likely uses a time-based index or priority queue for efficient expiration checks.
