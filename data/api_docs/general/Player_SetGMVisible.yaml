  method: SetGMVisible
  signature: void Player::SetGMVisible(bool on)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GM visibility status for the player, allowing or preventing other
    players from seeing the player's GM status.
  description: The SetGMVisible method controls whether a player's GM (Game Master)
    status is visible to other players in the game world. When called with true, it
    makes the player's GM status visible to others; when called with false, it hides
    the player's GM status from other players. This method is typically used during
    GM operations or when a player needs to temporarily hide their GM status for gameplay
    purposes. The visibility setting affects how other players perceive the player
    in terms of GM status and can influence interactions with NPCs and other players.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GM Visibility Toggle
    code: 'Player* player = GetSession()->GetPlayer();

      player->SetGMVisible(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Hiding GM Status
    code: 'Player* player = GetSession()->GetPlayer();

      player->SetGMVisible(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically affects the player's visibility in the game world and
    may require synchronization with other systems. Implementation involves updating
    player flags or state information that controls visibility to other players.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in player
    interactions, especially when dealing with GM status visibility. Players should
    be aware of how their GM status affects gameplay.
