  class: Unit
  method: SetInstantCast
  signature: void Unit::SetInstantCast(bool set)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the unit should use instant cast for spell effects.
  description: This method controls whether a unit will perform spells with instant
    cast behavior, bypassing normal casting time and channeling requirements. It is
    commonly used to enable or disable instant casting for specific spells or abilities,
    particularly in game mechanics where rapid spell execution is needed. The method
    affects the unit's ability to execute spells that would normally require a casting
    time or channeling period.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();

      target->SetInstantCast(true);

      // Now the unit will perform spells instantly'
    language: cpp
  - title: Toggle instant cast for specific spell
    code: 'Unit* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetInstantCast(false);

      // Disables instant cast for subsequent spells'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely modifies internal flags or state
    variables within the Unit class that control casting behavior. Performance considerations:
    Setting instant cast may affect spell cooldowns and game balance mechanics, particularly
    in PvP scenarios where rapid spell execution is involved.'
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can disrupt normal gameplay
    mechanics and spell progression. Incorrect usage may lead to unexpected behavior
    or game imbalance issues.
