  class: BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
  method: SetUpdateBatchSize
  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::SetUpdateBatchSize(uint32 size)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the batch size used for updating bot world sessions in optimized processing
    mode.
  description: The SetUpdateBatchSize method configures the number of bot world sessions
    that will be processed together in a single update cycle. This optimization technique
    helps reduce overhead by batching operations, improving performance when managing
    large numbers of bot sessions. The method directly affects how frequently and
    efficiently session updates occur within the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized class.
    It is typically called during initialization or configuration phases before active
    session management begins.
  parameters:
  - name: size
    description: The maximum number of bot world sessions to process in a single update
      batch. Valid values are positive integers; typical ranges may vary based on
      system resources and performance requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized sessionManager;

      sessionManager.SetUpdateBatchSize(100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tuning Example
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized* mgr = BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::Instance();

      uint32 optimalBatchSize = 50;

      mgr->SetUpdateBatchSize(optimalBatchSize);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting active session processing to
    ensure the batch size is properly initialized. Larger batch sizes can improve
    throughput but may increase latency per individual update. Consider system memory
    and CPU constraints when choosing an appropriate batch size value.
