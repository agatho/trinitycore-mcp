  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: UpdatePlayerSkill
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::UpdatePlayerSkill(Player * player, const SkillIndicators
    & indicators)
documentation:
  brief: Updates a player's skill level based on provided skill indicators in the
    adaptive difficulty system.
  description: The UpdatePlayerSkill method adjusts a player's skill level within
    the AdaptiveDifficulty system according to the given SkillIndicators. This method
    is typically invoked when a player's performance changes, such as after completing
    encounters or achieving specific milestones. It modifies internal tracking of
    player capabilities to dynamically adjust difficulty scaling. The method does
    not directly affect gameplay mechanics but influences how future difficulty calculations
    are made for the player.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose skill level will be updated. Must
      not be null.
  - name: indicators
    description: Reference to a SkillIndicators structure containing performance data
      used to determine skill adjustments. This includes metrics like completion times,
      success rates, and other relevant statistics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'SkillIndicators indicators;

      indicators.successRate = 0.85f;

      indicators.averageTime = 120.0f;

      AdaptiveDifficulty::UpdatePlayerSkill(player, indicators);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive difficulty system and should be called
    only when meaningful skill data is available. The implementation may cache or
    aggregate indicator values before applying changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. Incorrectly configured SkillIndicators can
    lead to unexpected skill adjustments.
