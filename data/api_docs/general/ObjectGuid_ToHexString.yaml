  method: ToHexString
  signature: std::string ObjectGuid::ToHexString() const
documentation:
  brief: Converts the ObjectGuid to a hexadecimal string representation.
  description: The ToHexString method serializes the ObjectGuid into a human-readable
    hexadecimal string format. This is commonly used for debugging, logging, or displaying
    unique identifiers in a more readable form. The resulting string typically represents
    the full GUID value in uppercase hexadecimal notation, prefixed with '0x' to indicate
    it's a hexadecimal number. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment, ObjectGuids
    are used extensively to uniquely identify game objects, players, creatures, and
    other entities within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the hexadecimal representation of the ObjectGuid,
    typically prefixed with '0x' and formatted in uppercase letters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      std::string hexString = guid.ToHexString();

      // Result: "0x0000000000003039"'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging GUID Values
    code: 'ObjectGuid playerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server.loading", "Player GUID: %s", playerGuid.ToHexString().c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs no allocation or complex operations, making it efficient
    for frequent use. The returned string is always in uppercase hexadecimal format
    and includes the '0x' prefix for clarity.
