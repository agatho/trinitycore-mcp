api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: MeetsReputationRequirement
  signature: bool VendorInteraction::MeetsReputationRequirement(Player * player, uint32
    vendorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets the required reputation level to interact with a
    vendor.
  description: The MeetsReputationRequirement method evaluates whether a given player
    has sufficient reputation with the faction associated with a specific vendor.
    This check is crucial for determining if a player can access vendor services,
    such as purchasing items or receiving quest rewards that are faction-restricted.
    The method typically retrieves the vendor's faction information and compares it
    against the player's current reputation level for that faction. It ensures game
    balance by preventing players from accessing high-level vendor content without
    meeting prerequisite reputation requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose reputation will be checked against
      the vendor's faction requirements. Must not be null.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor being checked. Used to
      retrieve the vendor's faction information from the game database.
  returns: Returns true if the player's reputation level meets or exceeds the minimum
    required for the vendor; otherwise returns false. A return value of false typically
    prevents the player from accessing vendor services.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Check
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 vendorGuid = ...;\nif (VendorInteraction::MeetsReputationRequirement(player,\
      \ vendorGuid)) {\n    // Player can interact with the vendor\n    player->GetSession()->SendListInventory(vendorGuid);\n\
      } else {\n    // Player cannot interact with the vendor\n    player->SendEquipError(EQUIP_ERR_REPUTATION_REQUIREMENT_NOT_MET);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Vendor Interaction
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 vendorGuid = ...;\nVendorInteraction vendorInteraction;\n\
      if (vendorInteraction.MeetsReputationRequirement(player, vendorGuid)) {\n  \
      \  // Proceed with vendor interaction logic\n    vendorInteraction.ProcessVendorTransaction(player,\
      \ vendorGuid);\n} else {\n    // Handle insufficient reputation case\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      You do not have sufficient reputation to interact with this vendor.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves database lookups to retrieve vendor faction data
    and player reputation values. It may cache results for performance optimization
    in high-frequency scenarios. The method assumes that the vendor GUID corresponds
    to a valid NPC entry in the creature_template table with faction information.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and vendorGuid parameters are valid before calling
    this method. Passing null player pointers or invalid vendor GUIDs can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. This method should not be used for non-vendor NPCs
    as it may not properly handle their faction requirements.
