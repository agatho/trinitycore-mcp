  class: GroupModel
  method: GetLiquidType
  signature: uint32 GroupModel::GetLiquidType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the liquid type identifier associated with the group model.
  description: The GetLiquidType method returns a unique identifier representing the
    type of liquid (such as water, lava, or magma) that is associated with the group
    model. This identifier is typically used in World of Warcraft's terrain and environment
    system to determine how players and objects interact with different liquid surfaces.
    The returned value corresponds to predefined liquid types defined in the game's
    database or configuration files. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe to call multiple times. It is commonly used during collision detection,
    environmental effect application, and gameplay mechanics that depend on liquid
    properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the liquid type identifier. Possible values
    include constants such as LIQUID_TYPE_WATER, LIQUID_TYPE_LAVA, or LIQUID_TYPE_MAGMA,
    depending on the game's internal definitions. Returns zero if no liquid type is
    assigned to the group model.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupModel* model = ...;\nuint32 liquidType = model->GetLiquidType();\n\
      if (liquidType == LIQUID_TYPE_WATER)\n{\n    // Handle water-specific logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Liquid Type for Collision Handling
    code: "GroupModel* model = player->GetGroupModel();\nuint32 liquidType = model->GetLiquidType();\n\
      switch (liquidType)\n{\n    case LIQUID_TYPE_WATER:\n        // Apply swimming\
      \ mechanics\n        break;\n    case LIQUID_TYPE_LAVA:\n        // Apply damage\
      \ over time\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Standard ground movement\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures related to the group model's
    liquid properties. It is assumed that the GroupModel instance has been properly
    initialized with valid liquid type information. The returned value should not
    be modified directly as it represents a constant property of the model.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupModel object is valid before calling this method,
    as accessing an uninitialized or destroyed model may result in undefined behavior.
    This method does not perform any validation on the returned liquid type value,
    so callers should verify that the value corresponds to expected liquid types for
    their use case.
