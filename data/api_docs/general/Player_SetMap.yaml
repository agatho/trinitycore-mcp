  class: Player
  method: SetMap
  signature: void Player::SetMap(int * map)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's current map reference to the specified map.
  description: The SetMap method assigns a map pointer to the Player object, effectively
    updating the player's current map context. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to manage player movement and positioning within different
    game maps. It ensures that the player's map reference is properly updated when
    transitioning between different map instances or zones. The method does not perform
    any validation checks on the map pointer, so developers must ensure that the map
    pointer is valid before calling this method.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the map object that the player should be set to. This
      represents the current map context for the player and must be a valid map pointer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Map* map = new Map();

      player->SetMap(map);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nMap* map = GetMap();\nplayer->SetMap(map);\n\
      // Ensure map is valid before setting\nif (map != nullptr)\n{\n    player->SetMap(map);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid map case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the player's
    map context. It is recommended to validate that the map pointer is valid before
    calling this method, as invalid pointers can cause memory access violations or
    undefined behavior. The method does not perform any synchronization or thread
    safety checks, so developers must ensure proper thread handling when using this
    method in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid map pointer can lead to memory corruption
    or crashes. Developers should always verify that the map pointer is valid before
    calling SetMap. Additionally, this method does not handle any map transition logic,
    so developers must ensure proper map management when transitioning between different
    maps.
