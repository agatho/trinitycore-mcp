  method: Shutdown
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the learning analytics system, cleaning up resources and stopping
    data collection.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the LearningAnalytics system by releasing
    all allocated resources, stopping ongoing data collection processes, and ensuring
    that any pending analytics events are properly flushed. This method is typically
    called during server shutdown or when the analytics subsystem needs to be disabled
    temporarily. It ensures a clean termination of the analytics service without leaving
    dangling references or incomplete operations. The method performs no operations
    if the system was not previously initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: LearningAnalytics::Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called only once during the lifetime of the
    application. Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks
    if not properly handled internally. The shutdown process is synchronous and will
    block until all cleanup operations are complete.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown after the system has already been shut down may lead
    to crashes or memory corruption if internal state management is not robust. Ensure
    that no other threads are actively using the analytics system before invoking
    this method.
