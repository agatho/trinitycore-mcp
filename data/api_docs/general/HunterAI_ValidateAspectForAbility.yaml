  class: HunterAI
  method: ValidateAspectForAbility
  signature: bool HunterAI::ValidateAspectForAbility(int spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a specified spell ID corresponds to a valid aspect ability
    for the hunter AI.
  description: The ValidateAspectForAbility method checks if the provided spell ID
    represents a valid aspect ability that can be used by the hunter AI. This method
    is typically used during AI decision-making processes to ensure that only legitimate
    aspect spells are considered for casting or activation. It evaluates the spell
    ID against known aspect abilities within the HunterAI framework, returning true
    if the spell is recognized as a valid aspect and false otherwise. The method plays
    a crucial role in maintaining proper AI behavior by preventing invalid or unsupported
    aspects from being selected during combat decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell ID corresponds to a valid hunter aspect
    ability, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "if (hunterAI->ValidateAspectForAbility(13165)) {\n    // Spell ID 13165\
      \ is a valid aspect\n    // Proceed with aspect selection logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell ID mappings or lookup tables
    specific to hunter aspects. The implementation may cache results for performance
    optimization. Developers should be aware that this validation is crucial for maintaining
    AI consistency and preventing invalid spell selections.
  warnings: Do not use this method with non-aspect spell IDs as it may return unexpected
    results. Ensure that the spell ID being validated is actually an aspect ability
    before calling this method to avoid incorrect AI behavior.
