  brief: Initializes shaman profession skills and associated data for a player
  description: The InitializeShamanProfessions method sets up all necessary shaman
    profession entries, including skill levels, spell learning, and related game mechanics
    for shaman characters. This method is typically called during player initialization
    or when a character first selects the shaman class. It ensures that all shaman-specific
    professions are properly configured with default values and available spells.
    The method handles internal data structures required for shaman profession tracking
    within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Player Login
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->getClass() == CLASS_SHAMAN)\n\
      \    {\n        sProfessionManager->InitializeShamanProfessions();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player session during character
    initialization. It modifies internal profession tracking data structures and may
    affect spell availability immediately after execution.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same player instance may cause
    unexpected behavior or duplicate entries in profession tracking. Ensure this is
    called only during appropriate initialization phases.
