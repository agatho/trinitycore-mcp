  class: ArenaAI
  method: ExecutePositioning
  signature: void ArenaAI::ExecutePositioning(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes positioning logic for arena AI players based on provided player
    reference.
  description: The ExecutePositioning method in ArenaAI class handles the tactical
    positioning behavior of AI players within an arena environment. It takes a pointer
    to an integer representing a player identifier and applies positioning strategies
    such as maintaining optimal distance from opponents, positioning for specific
    abilities, or repositioning during combat. This method is typically invoked during
    AI update cycles to ensure that arena participants maintain strategic positioning
    relative to their opponents. The method modifies the internal state of the AI
    controller based on the current player's position and the game context.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) for
      which positioning logic should be executed. This value is used to determine
      which specific AI-controlled player's positioning needs adjustment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ExecutePositioning Usage
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      arenaAI->ExecutePositioning(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: ExecutePositioning in Arena Combat Loop
    code: "void ArenaCombatUpdate()\n{\n    for (auto& player : arenaPlayers)\n  \
      \  {\n        if (player.isAIControlled)\n        {\n            int* playerId\
      \ = &player.guid;\n            arenaAI->ExecutePositioning(playerId);\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the arena AI subsystem and should only be called when
    the player is in an arena environment. The method assumes that the player reference
    points to a valid arena participant with appropriate AI behavior enabled. Performance
    considerations include avoiding frequent calls during high-frequency update loops.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null player pointer may result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the player identifier corresponds to a valid arena participant before
    calling this method. The method modifies internal AI state and should not be called
    concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
