  class: QuestPickup
  method: HasAvailableQuests
  signature: bool QuestPickup::HasAvailableQuests(uint32 questGiverGuid, Player *
    bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has any available quests from a specified quest giver.
  description: The HasAvailableQuests method determines whether a given player (bot)
    has any quests available to accept from a specific quest giver identified by its
    GUID. This method is typically used in botting or AI systems to dynamically assess
    quest availability and guide player actions. It evaluates the player's quest log,
    quest status, and quest requirements against the quest giver's available quests.
    The method considers both active and available quests that meet the player's level
    and prerequisite conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver object. This value
      identifies which NPC or object is providing the quests to check against.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player whose
      available quests are being checked. This parameter is essential for evaluating
      quest prerequisites and player state.
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least one available quest from the specified
    quest giver, false otherwise. The method returns false when no quests are available
    or when the player's state prevents quest acceptance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Availability Check
    code: "if (questPickup->HasAvailableQuests(12345, playerBot)) {\n    // Player\
      \ has available quests from NPC with GUID 12345\n    // Proceed with quest acceptance\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Quest Bot Logic
    code: "uint32 npcGuid = 7890;\nPlayer* bot = session->GetPlayer();\nif (questPickup->HasAvailableQuests(npcGuid,\
      \ bot)) {\n    // Find and accept the first available quest\n    // Implementation\
      \ for quest acceptance logic here\n} else {\n    // No quests available, move\
      \ to next NPC or action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against the player's quest log
    and the quest giver's quest list. It may consider quest level requirements, faction
    status, and previous quest completion status. The implementation might cache results
    or perform database queries to determine quest availability.
  warnings: Ensure that the questGiverGuid is valid and corresponds to an actual quest
    giver in the game world. Passing invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. Be aware that this method might not account for dynamic
    quest conditions that change during runtime.
