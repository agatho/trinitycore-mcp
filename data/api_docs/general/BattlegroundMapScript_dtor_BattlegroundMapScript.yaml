documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BattlegroundMapScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BattlegroundMapScript class is responsible for
    releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were acquired during
    the object's lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's battleground system, this
    method ensures proper cleanup of map-specific battleground data structures, event
    handlers, and references when a battleground map script instance is being destroyed.
    This typically occurs when a battleground ends or is removed from the game world.
    The destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return operations
    as it is a destructor.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BattlegroundMapScript
    code: 'BattlegroundMapScript* bgScript = new BattlegroundMapScript();

      // ... use the script ...

      del bgScript; // Triggers ~BattlegroundMapScript() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call
    destructors unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destructor
    ensures that all battleground-specific resources are properly released to prevent
    memory leaks.
