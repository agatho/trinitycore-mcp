  signature: uint32 Item::GetAppearanceModId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the appearance modifier ID associated with an item.
  description: The GetAppearanceModId method returns the unique identifier that represents
    the appearance modification applied to an item. This value is used in conjunction
    with the item's appearance data to determine how the item should look when displayed
    in-game. The method is typically used during item processing or display logic
    to ensure proper visual representation of items with custom appearances. It may
    return zero if no appearance modifier is set or if the item does not support appearance
    modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the appearance modifier ID, which can
    be zero if no modifier is applied or if the item lacks appearance data. This ID
    is used to lookup appearance data in the game's appearance system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 modId = item->GetAppearanceModId();\nif (modId != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Process appearance modifier\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(guid);\nuint32 modId = item->GetAppearanceModId();\n\
      if (modId > 0)\n{\n    // Use modId to retrieve appearance data from database\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it simply returns a stored value. Implementation
    details include the fact that this ID is typically set during item creation or
    modification processes.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    appearance-related methods, as incorrect handling of modifier IDs may lead to
    visual inconsistencies in item display. Avoid using this method on items without
    proper appearance data.
