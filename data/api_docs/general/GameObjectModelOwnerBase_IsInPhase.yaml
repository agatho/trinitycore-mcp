  class: GameObjectModelOwnerBase
  method: IsInPhase
  signature: bool GameObjectModelOwnerBase::IsInPhase(const PhaseShift & param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the GameObjectModelOwnerBase is active within the specified
    phase shift.
  description: The IsInPhase method checks if the current GameObjectModelOwnerBase
    instance is included in the given PhaseShift. This functionality is crucial for
    determining visibility and interaction of game objects based on player phases
    or world states. The method evaluates the internal phase data against the provided
    phase shift to return a boolean result indicating inclusion. It's commonly used
    in gameplay logic where certain objects should only be visible or interactable
    during specific phases.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A constant reference to a PhaseShift object that defines the phase
      context to check against.
  returns: Returns true if the GameObjectModelOwnerBase is active within the specified
    phase shift; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Phase Check
    code: "if (gameObject->IsInPhase(phaseShift)) {\n    // Object is visible/active\
      \ in this phase\n    gameObject->Activate();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Object Interaction
    code: "if (player->IsInPhase(player->GetPhaseShift()) && gameObject->IsInPhase(player->GetPhaseShift()))\
      \ {\n    // Both player and object are in the same phase\n    player->InteractWith(gameObject);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal phase tracking mechanisms. It's important
    to ensure that the PhaseShift parameter is properly initialized before calling
    this method. The performance impact is minimal as it typically involves simple
    bit-mask comparisons.
  warnings: Ensure that the PhaseShift object passed to this method contains valid
    phase data. Passing an uninitialized or improperly configured PhaseShift may lead
    to incorrect results.
