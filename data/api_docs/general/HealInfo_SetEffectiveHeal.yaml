  class: HealInfo
  method: SetEffectiveHeal
  signature: void HealInfo::SetEffectiveHeal(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the effective heal amount for a HealInfo object, determining the actual
    healing value applied to a target.
  description: The SetEffectiveHeal method assigns a specified healing amount to the
    HealInfo object, which represents the effective healing that will be applied to
    a target unit. This value is typically used in conjunction with other healing
    calculations and modifiers within the TrinityCore framework. The method directly
    sets the internal effective heal value without performing any additional computations
    or validations. It's commonly used during the healing process when the final heal
    amount has been determined, either through direct healing spells or through healing
    modifiers such as critical heals, buffs, or talents.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The effective heal amount to be set for this HealInfo object. This
      value represents the actual healing points that will be applied to the target
      unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'HealInfo healInfo;

      healInfo.SetEffectiveHeal(1000);

      // The effective heal amount is now set to 1000'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Healing Spell Logic
    code: "void ApplyHealing(Unit* target, uint32 baseHeal) {\n    HealInfo healInfo;\n\
      \    uint32 effectiveHeal = baseHeal + CalculateHealingModifiers();\n    healInfo.SetEffectiveHeal(effectiveHeal);\n\
      \    target->DealHeal(&healInfo);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the HealInfo object and
    should be called after all healing calculations are complete. It does not perform
    any validation on the input value, so callers should ensure that the amount is
    a valid positive integer before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative or zero value may result in unexpected
    behavior during healing application. This method should only be used when the
    effective heal amount has been fully calculated and validated.
