  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: ExecuteSync
  signature: int BotDatabasePool::ExecuteSync(int * stmt, uint32 timeoutMs)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a database statement synchronously with a specified timeout.
  description: The ExecuteSync method performs a synchronous execution of a database
    statement within the BotDatabasePool, allowing for controlled blocking behavior
    during database operations. This method is designed to handle database transactions
    in a thread-safe manner, ensuring that operations complete within the defined
    timeout period. It's typically used in bot-related systems where database consistency
    and timing are critical for proper functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: stmt
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the prepared statement to execute.
      This value should be initialized with a valid statement identifier before calling
      the method.
  - name: timeoutMs
    description: Timeout value in milliseconds for the database operation. If the
      operation exceeds this time, it will be terminated and return an error code.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the result of the execution. A return value
    of 0 typically indicates success, while non-zero values may represent various
    error conditions such as timeout, connection failure, or statement execution errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteSync
    code: "int statement = 12345;\nint result = botDatabasePool.ExecuteSync(&statement,\
      \ 5000);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Operation completed successfully\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle error condition\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ExecuteSync with error handling
    code: "int statement = prepareStatement(\"INSERT INTO bot_data VALUES (?, ?)\"\
      );\nint result = botDatabasePool.ExecuteSync(&statement, 10000);\nswitch (result)\
      \ {\n    case 0:\n        // Success\n        break;\n    case -1:\n       \
      \ // Timeout occurred\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Other error\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method blocks the calling thread until either the database operation
    completes or the timeout is reached. It's important to choose appropriate timeout
    values to avoid deadlocks in multi-threaded environments. The method assumes that
    the statement parameter has been properly initialized with a valid database statement
    identifier.
  warnings: Using excessive timeouts can lead to performance degradation and potential
    deadlocks. Ensure that all database statements passed to this method are properly
    prepared and validated before execution. This method should not be called from
    time-critical sections of code where blocking behavior is undesirable.
