documentation:
  brief: Contributes items from a player's inventory to the guild bank.
  description: The ContributeToGuildBank method allows a player to transfer items
    from their personal inventory into the guild bank. This action typically requires
    the player to have sufficient permissions within the guild and may be subject
    to guild bank configuration settings such as item restrictions or contribution
    limits. The method handles the necessary inventory management, updates the guild
    bank contents, and ensures proper logging of the transaction for audit purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Bank Contribution
    code: "void Player::ContributeToGuildBank()\n{\n    // Assuming player has valid\
      \ guild and permissions\n    if (GetGuild() && GetGuild()->HasPermission(this,\
      \ GUILD_PERMISSION_CONTRIBUTE))\n    {\n        // Logic to move items from\
      \ player inventory to guild bank\n        // Implementation details would involve\
      \ item validation and transaction handling\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player selects an item in their inventory
    and chooses to contribute it to the guild bank through the UI. It's important
    that the player has both the required guild permissions and that the item being
    contributed meets any configured restrictions within the guild bank settings.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to inventory desynchronization
    or unauthorized item transfers. The method should always validate that the player
    has the correct permissions before proceeding with any item movement.
