  class: PlayerCreateInfoAction
  method: PlayerCreateInfoAction
  signature: void PlayerCreateInfoAction::PlayerCreateInfoAction(uint8 _button, uint32
    _action, uint8 _type)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a player create info action with specified button, action, and
    type values.
  description: The PlayerCreateInfoAction constructor initializes an instance of the
    PlayerCreateInfoAction class with the provided button index, action identifier,
    and action type. This class is typically used in the context of character creation
    to define initial actions or abilities available to new players. The method sets
    up internal state variables that represent how a player's initial actions are
    configured during the character creation process. It does not perform any validation
    on the input parameters but assumes valid values are passed based on expected
    game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: _button
    description: The button index (0-11) representing which action button this action
      is assigned to during character creation
  - name: _action
    description: The action identifier (e.g., spell ID, ability ID) that will be assigned
      to the specified button
  - name: _type
    description: The type of action being defined (0 = ACTION_BUTTON_ACTION, 1 = ACTION_BUTTON_SPELL,
      2 = ACTION_BUTTON_ITEM)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize a basic action button for new player
    code: PlayerCreateInfoAction action(0, 879, 1); // Assign spell ID 879 to button
      0 as a spell action
    language: cpp
  - title: Set up multiple initial actions during character creation
    code: "PlayerCreateInfoAction actions[3] = {\n    PlayerCreateInfoAction(0, 879,\
      \ 1),\n    PlayerCreateInfoAction(1, 12345, 1),\n    PlayerCreateInfoAction(2,\
      \ 67890, 1)\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during character creation. The action type values are defined as constants in
    the codebase (ACTION_BUTTON_ACTION = 0, ACTION_BUTTON_SPELL = 1, ACTION_BUTTON_ITEM
    = 2). Developers should ensure that action IDs correspond to valid entries in
    the game's databases.
  warnings: This method does not validate input parameters. Passing invalid button
    indices (outside 0-11 range) or invalid action type values may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect character creation data. Ensure that action IDs reference
    existing spells, items, or abilities in the database.
