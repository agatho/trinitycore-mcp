documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current value of a specified resource type from the ResourceManager.
  description: The GetResource method fetches the current value of a given resource
    type managed by the ResourceManager. This method is typically used in World of
    Warcraft TrinityCore to access player or object resource values such as health,
    mana, rage, energy, or other game-specific resources. The method operates on a
    predefined set of resource types and returns the corresponding current value for
    that resource. It does not modify any internal state and is generally safe for
    repeated calls. This functionality is essential for gameplay mechanics involving
    resource management, ability usage, and status display.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the current amount of the specified
    resource type. The exact meaning of this value depends on the ResourceType enum
    provided, with typical values being health points, mana points, or other game
    resource quantities.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Player Health
    code: 'uint32 health = resourceManager->GetResource(ResourceType::HEALTH);

      // Returns current player''s health value'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Mana Resource Before Spell Casting
    code: "if (resourceManager->GetResource(ResourceType::MANA) >= 100)\n{\n    //\
      \ Cast spell that costs 100 mana\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the ResourceManager has been properly initialized and
    contains valid resource data. The method should not be called on uninitialized
    or invalid ResourceManager instances. Performance is generally good as it's a
    simple lookup operation, but repeated calls in tight loops should be avoided if
    possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the ResourceType parameter corresponds to a valid resource
    type defined in the system. Using an invalid resource type may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect return values. This method does not validate input parameters
    beyond basic type checking.
