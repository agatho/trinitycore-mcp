  class: ShamanAI
  method: DelegateToSpecialization
  signature: void ShamanAI::DelegateToSpecialization(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Delegates AI behavior to the appropriate specialization-specific logic for
    a shaman.
  description: The DelegateToSpecialization method in the ShamanAI class routes the
    AI's decision-making process to specialization-specific implementations. This
    allows the shaman AI to dynamically adapt its behavior based on the current shaman's
    specialization (Elemental, Enhancement, or Restoration). The method likely evaluates
    the shaman's current state, including mana levels, target conditions, and combat
    situation, then invokes the relevant specialization handler. It serves as a central
    dispatcher for specialization-specific actions within the shaman's AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or identifier
      that the shaman AI should consider when making specialization-based decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in shaman AI context
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetIndex = target->GetEntry(); // Simplified example\n\
      \        DelegateToSpecialization(&targetIndex);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI state machine that switches between
    different specialization behaviors. The target parameter may be used to determine
    optimal spell selection or action priority based on the current target's threat
    level or type.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it modifies the target parameter, which
    could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly managed. Ensure proper initialization
    of the target variable before calling this method.
