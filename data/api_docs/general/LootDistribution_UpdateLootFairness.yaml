  method: UpdateLootFairness
  signature: void LootDistribution::UpdateLootFairness(uint32 groupId, uint32 winnerGuid,
    const LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Updates loot fairness tracking for a specific group and item after distribution.
  description: The UpdateLootFairness method is responsible for maintaining fair loot
    distribution among group members in World of Warcraft. It tracks which player
    received which item from a specific loot group, ensuring that loot is distributed
    according to the game's fairness rules. This method is typically called during
    the loot distribution process when an item is awarded to a winner. The implementation
    likely updates internal data structures that track loot history and fairness metrics
    for each group member.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the loot group from which the item was distributed.
      This identifies the specific group context for the loot distribution.
  - name: winnerGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player who won the loot
      item. This represents the recipient of the distributed item.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      item that was distributed, including item ID, stack size, and other relevant
      properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Distribution Context
    code: 'LootDistribution lootDist;

      uint32 groupId = 1001;

      uint32 winnerGuid = 123456;

      LootItem item;

      item.itemid = 45678;

      item.count = 1;

      lootDist.UpdateLootFairness(groupId, winnerGuid, item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger loot fairness system that prevents
    players from receiving excessive loot or ensures equitable distribution. The internal
    tracking mechanism may be used for debugging, logging, or enforcing game rules
    related to loot distribution. It's important to note that this method operates
    within the context of group loot mechanics and may not be directly callable outside
    of proper loot distribution sequences.
  warnings: This method should only be called during legitimate loot distribution
    events. Incorrect usage could lead to inaccurate fairness tracking and potentially
    affect gameplay balance. The method assumes valid parameters and does not perform
    extensive validation, so callers must ensure groupId and winnerGuid are valid
    before invoking this method.
