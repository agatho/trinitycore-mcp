  class: FollowerAI

  signature: void FollowerAI::RemoveFollowState(int followState)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified follow state from the follower AI.
  description: The RemoveFollowState method is used to remove a specific follow state
    flag from the FollowerAI instance. This method typically manages the internal
    state flags that control how a creature behaves in relation to following a player
    or object. It allows for fine-grained control over the follower's behavior by
    clearing individual state bits, which can be useful when transitioning between
    different follower states such as stopping follow, pausing, or resuming. The method
    operates on an integer parameter representing the specific follow state flag to
    remove.
  parameters:
  - name: followState
    description: An integer value representing the specific follow state flag to be
      removed from the follower's internal state. This is typically a bitmask value
      that corresponds to predefined follow states such as FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOW, FOLLOW_STATE_LEASHED,
      etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Follow State
    code: "void RemoveFollowState(int followState)\n{\n    m_followState &= ~followState;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stop Following Player
    code: "if (followerAI)\n{\n    followerAI->RemoveFollowState(FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOW);\n\
      \    // Follower will no longer follow the player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the FollowerAI instance using
    bitwise operations. The followState parameter should be a valid bitmask value
    that corresponds to defined follow states in the codebase. It is important to
    ensure that the correct state flags are used to avoid unintended behavior.
  warnings: Using incorrect or invalid followState values may result in undefined
    behavior or unexpected follower AI actions. Ensure that only predefined and valid
    follow state constants are passed to this method.
