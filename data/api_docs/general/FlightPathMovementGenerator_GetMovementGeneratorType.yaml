documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for flight path movement.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique type identifier
    associated with the FlightPathMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used
    internally by TrinityCore's movement system to distinguish different types of
    movement generators and ensure proper handling of creature or player movement
    behaviors. The returned value typically corresponds to a predefined enum or constant
    that represents flight path navigation specifically. This method is commonly called
    during movement update cycles to determine how an object should be moved through
    the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for flight
    paths. This value is typically a constant defined within the MovementGeneratorType
    enum or similar system, indicating that the object is using flight path movement
    logic.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Movement Generator Type
    code: "void CheckFlightPathMovement(Unit* unit)\n{\n    if (unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == FLIGHT_PATH_MOTION_TYPE)\n    {\n        // Object is currently using flight\
      \ path movement\n        sLog->outString(\"Unit is on a flight path.\");\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns a cached or predefined value.
    It does not perform any computation or state changes, making it safe for frequent
    calls during movement updates. The exact integer value returned depends on the
    implementation in TrinityCore's MovementGeneratorType enum.
