documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MoveSplineInit object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The MoveSplineInit destructor is responsible for cleaning up memory
    and resources allocated during the initialization of movement splines. This method
    ensures proper deallocation of internal data structures used for calculating smooth
    character movement paths in World of Warcraft. It is automatically invoked when
    a MoveSplineInit object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor
    handles cleanup of spline-related buffers, temporary data structures, and any
    other resources that were allocated during the initialization phase of movement
    calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    MoveSplineInit init;\n    // ... use init for\
      \ movement initialization ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when init\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called and should not be invoked manually. It's
    important to understand that MoveSplineInit objects are typically short-lived
    and used only during movement initialization phases. The destruction process ensures
    no memory leaks occur in the spline calculation system.
