  signature: void BattlePetMgr::ToggleJournalLock(bool lock)
documentation:
  brief: Toggles the lock state of the battle pet journal for the player.
  description: The ToggleJournalLock method switches the lock state of a player's
    battle pet journal, allowing or preventing modifications to the journal entries.
    When locked, players cannot add new pets, remove existing pets, or modify their
    battle pet data. This functionality is typically used during specific game events
    or when a player wishes to prevent accidental changes to their pet collection.
    The method does not validate whether the player has the necessary permissions
    or if the journal is already in the desired state; it simply toggles the current
    lock status.
  parameters:
  - name: lock
    description: A boolean value indicating the desired lock state of the journal.
      If true, the journal will be locked; if false, it will be unlocked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Locking the Battle Pet Journal
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petMgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      petMgr->ToggleJournalLock(true); // Locks the journal'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unlocking the Battle Pet Journal
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petMgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      petMgr->ToggleJournalLock(false); // Unlocks the journal'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal flags or database entries that
    track the journal's lock state. It may also trigger UI updates to reflect the
    new lock status in the client.
