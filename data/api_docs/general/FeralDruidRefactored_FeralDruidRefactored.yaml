documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Feral Druid AI behavior for the specified player bot.
  description: The FeralDruidRefactored constructor initializes the AI behavior for
    a Feral Druid class in TrinityCore. This method sets up the necessary parameters,
    abilities, and decision-making logic specific to the Feral Druid's combat style,
    including cat form management, combo point tracking, and ability prioritization.
    It configures the bot to handle melee combat effectively using abilities like
    Shred, Rake, and Ferocious Bite while maintaining proper energy management and
    positioning. The method ensures that the AI respects class-specific mechanics
    such as the cat form transformation, combo point generation, and the Feral Combat
    Tree's talent dependencies.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'FeralDruidRefactored druidAI(playerBot);

      // Initializes the Feral Druid AI for playerBot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The initialization
    process includes setting up ability cooldowns, combo point tracking, and positioning
    logic. The AI will automatically manage form switching between human and cat form
    based on combat requirements.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same bot instance as
    it may cause conflicts in state management. Ensure that the player parameter is
    valid and represents a Feral Druid class before calling this constructor.
