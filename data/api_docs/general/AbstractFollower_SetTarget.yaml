  class: AbstractFollower
  method: SetTarget
  signature: void AbstractFollower::SetTarget(Unit * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target unit for this abstract follower.
  description: The SetTarget method assigns a specific Unit as the target for an AbstractFollower
    instance. This is commonly used in AI behavior systems where followers need to
    track or engage with specific targets. The method updates internal state to reflect
    the new target, which may influence subsequent AI decisions such as movement,
    casting spells, or attacking. It's important to note that setting a target does
    not automatically initiate combat or movement; it simply establishes the target
    reference for the follower's AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will be set as the target. Must be
      a valid pointer to a Unit instance, or nullptr to clear the current target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Target for an AbstractFollower
    code: 'AbstractFollower* follower = ...;

      Unit* target = ...;

      follower->SetTarget(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing the Current Target
    code: 'AbstractFollower* follower = ...;

      follower->SetTarget(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by AI systems or game logic to update a follower's
    target. The target unit should remain valid for the duration of its use, as the
    follower may reference it during AI processing. If the target unit is destroyed
    or removed from the world, the follower should be notified to clear its target.
  warnings: Passing an invalid pointer (e.g., dangling pointer) to this method can
    cause undefined behavior. Always ensure that the Unit pointer passed to SetTarget
    remains valid for as long as the follower may use it. Setting a target to nullptr
    is safe and will clear the current target reference.
