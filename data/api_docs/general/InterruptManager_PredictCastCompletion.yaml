  brief: Predicts the completion time of a spell cast based on the interrupt target's
    current state
  description: The PredictCastCompletion method calculates and returns an estimated
    completion time for a spell cast operation. This prediction takes into account
    various factors such as the target's current casting state, any ongoing interruptions
    or delays, and the base cast time of the spell being predicted. The method is
    typically used in AI systems to determine when a spell will complete, allowing
    for strategic decision-making and timing of interrupts or other actions. It serves
    as a predictive tool rather than an exact measurement, providing a relative estimate
    useful for tactical planning.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the predicted time (in seconds) until the cast
    completion. This value is typically used to schedule subsequent actions or determine
    when an interrupt should be applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float completionTime = interruptManager.PredictCastCompletion(target);\n\
      if (completionTime < 2.0f) {\n    // Apply interrupt immediately\n    target.Interrupt();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using prediction for spell timing optimization
    code: "InterruptTarget* currentTarget = GetBestInterruptTarget();\nfloat predictedTime\
      \ = interruptManager.PredictCastCompletion(*currentTarget);\nif (predictedTime\
      \ > 3.0f) {\n    // Wait for cast to complete\n    SetNextAction(ACTION_WAIT);\n\
      } else {\n    // Prepare interrupt now\n    PrepareInterrupt();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in combat AI systems and requires a valid InterruptTarget
    object to function properly. The prediction accuracy may vary based on the complexity
    of the spell being cast and the target's state changes during the casting process.
  warnings: The returned value is a prediction and not an exact time. It should be
    used for tactical planning rather than precise timing calculations. Using this
    method without a proper InterruptTarget can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    predictions.
