documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the incoming damage rate for a Vengeance Demon Hunter.
  description: This method computes the rate at which incoming damage is processed
    by the Vengeance Demon Hunter class. It takes into account various factors such
    as damage reduction mechanics, armor values, and any active mitigation effects
    that may be applied to the character. The result represents a normalized value
    indicating how much of the incoming damage is actually absorbed or mitigated by
    the hunter's vengeance abilities. This calculation is typically used in damage
    simulation, combat analysis, or UI display logic to provide players with accurate
    feedback on their defensive capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the incoming damage rate. A value of 1.0 indicates
    no mitigation (full damage taken), while values less than 1.0 indicate damage
    reduction through vengeance mechanics. Values greater than 1.0 may occur in edge
    cases involving damage amplification effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float damageRate = demonHunter.CalculateIncomingDamageRate();\n// Use the\
      \ damage rate to adjust UI elements or perform calculations\nif (damageRate\
      \ < 0.5f)\n{\n    // Player has high mitigation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during combat events or when calculating damage
    outcomes. The implementation may vary depending on active talents, buffs, and
    the current state of the Demon Hunter's vengeance system.
