documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the action target identifier for the triggered event
  description: The GetActionTarget method retrieves a pointer to an integer representing
    the target of the proc event. This is commonly used in spell and ability trigger
    systems within TrinityCore's combat framework. The returned pointer points to
    the GUID (Global Unique Identifier) of the target unit involved in the proc event,
    which can be used to determine which entity was affected by the triggered effect.
    The method is typically called during the processing of procced abilities or spells
    where the target information is needed for further logic execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer (int*) that represents the GUID of the action target
    involved in the proc event. Returns nullptr if no valid target exists or the event
    has not been properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell proc handler
    code: "void MySpell::HandleProc(ProcEventInfo& eventInfo)\n{\n    int* targetGuid\
      \ = eventInfo.GetActionTarget();\n    if (targetGuid && *targetGuid != 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // Process the proc with valid target\n        Unit* target\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*targetGuid);\n        if (target)\n        {\n\
      \            // Apply effect to target\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer is only valid during the scope of the current proc event
    processing. Do not store this pointer for later use as it may become invalid.
    The method assumes that the ProcEventInfo object has been properly initialized
    with valid event data.
  warnings: Be cautious when dereferencing the returned pointer - always verify it's
    not null before using it. The target GUID might be zero if no valid target was
    determined during the proc event setup, which could indicate an error in event
    triggering or processing logic.
