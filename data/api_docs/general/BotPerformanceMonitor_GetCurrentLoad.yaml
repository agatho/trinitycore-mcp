  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: GetCurrentLoad
  signature: float BotPerformanceMonitor::GetCurrentLoad() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current CPU load percentage of the bot performance
    monitoring system.
  description: The GetCurrentLoad method retrieves the instantaneous CPU utilization
    rate of the bot performance monitoring subsystem. This value represents how much
    processing power is currently being consumed by bot-related operations within
    the TrinityCore server environment. The returned float value typically ranges
    from 0.0 to 100.0, where 0.0 indicates no load and 100.0 indicates maximum possible
    load. This method is primarily used for performance tuning, identifying bottlenecks,
    and monitoring system health in large-scale World of Warcraft server environments
    with active bot populations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current CPU load percentage (0.0 to 100.0)
    of the bot performance monitoring system. Values closer to 100.0 indicate high
    system utilization, while values near 0.0 suggest minimal bot activity or system
    resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Load Monitoring
    code: "BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;\nfloat currentLoad = monitor.GetCurrentLoad();\n\
      if (currentLoad > 80.0f) {\n    // Alert: High load detected\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Warning: Bot system load is %.2f%%\", currentLoad);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Load-Based Resource Management
    code: "void ManageBotResources() {\n    BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;\n    float\
      \ load = monitor.GetCurrentLoad();\n    \n    if (load > 90.0f) {\n        //\
      \ Reduce bot activity to prevent system overload\n        sBotAI->SuspendAllBots();\n\
      \    } else if (load < 30.0f) {\n        // Increase bot activity when system\
      \ has capacity\n        sBotAI->ResumeAllBots();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a snapshot calculation of current CPU load and may not
    reflect long-term trends. The implementation likely uses high-resolution timers
    and system APIs to measure actual processor utilization. The value returned should
    be interpreted in context with other performance metrics for comprehensive system
    analysis.
  warnings: Repeated calls to this method without proper throttling may introduce
    performance overhead. The load measurement might include overhead from the monitoring
    itself, potentially skewing results in very low-load scenarios.
