documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff effects on the Elemental Shaman character.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buff effects applied to an Elemental Shaman instance. This includes checking
    the duration of buffs, applying any necessary updates to stat modifiers, and ensuring
    that the character's current state accurately reflects all ongoing beneficial
    effects. The method typically runs during each update cycle or when specific conditions
    are met, such as spell casting or aura changes. It ensures that the shaman's performance
    remains consistent with the active buff stack and handles cleanup of expired buffs.

    buff states. It may internally iterate through a list of active auras and perform
    updates based on their timers and effects.
