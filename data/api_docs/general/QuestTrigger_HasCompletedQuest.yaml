documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot has completed a specific quest in the quest trigger.
  description: The HasCompletedQuest method determines whether the bot controlled
    by the provided BotAI instance has already completed the quest associated with
    this QuestTrigger. This method is typically used in AI logic to conditionally
    execute actions based on quest completion status. It evaluates the player's quest
    log and returns true if the quest is marked as completed, false otherwise. The
    method relies on the internal state of the quest trigger and the bot's current
    quest progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot has completed the quest associated with this QuestTrigger;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:

    code: "if (questTrigger->HasCompletedQuest(ai)) {\n    // Perform actions after\
      \ quest completion\n    ai->GetBot()->GetPlayer()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Quest completed!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI instance passed to it is properly initialized
    and has access to the player's quest data. The method may not reflect real-time
    changes if quest states are cached or updated asynchronously.
