  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: ValidateObjectiveConsistency
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::ValidateObjectiveConsistency(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates the consistency of objectives tracked by a player's objective tracker.
  description: The ValidateObjectiveConsistency method ensures that all objectives
    currently being tracked by a player's objective tracker are in a consistent state.
    This involves checking that tracked objectives match the player's current quest
    status, verifying that any required items or kills are still valid, and ensuring
    no stale or orphaned objectives remain in the tracker. The method is typically
    invoked during player state transitions or periodic updates to maintain the integrity
    of the objective tracking system within TrinityCore's quest management framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose objective consistency is being
      validated. This parameter represents the specific player instance for which
      the tracker validation occurs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Update Context
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    // ... quest\
      \ acceptance logic ...\n    sObjectMgr->ValidateObjectiveConsistency(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic Validation During Player Update
    code: "void UpdatePlayerObject(Player* player, uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other\
      \ update logic ...\n    if (diff >= 30000) // Every 30 seconds\n    {\n    \
      \    sObjectMgr->ValidateObjectiveConsistency(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal quest management system and
    is not typically called directly by external modules. It may perform operations
    that modify the player's objective tracker state, so it should be used carefully
    during sensitive update phases.
  warnings: Calling this method during active quest progression or while processing
    quest events might cause unexpected behavior if the underlying quest data changes
    concurrently. Ensure thread safety when invoking from multiple contexts.
