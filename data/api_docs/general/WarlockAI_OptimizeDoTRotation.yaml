  class: WarlockAI
  method: OptimizeDoTRotation
  signature: void WarlockAI::OptimizeDoTRotation()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the Warlock's DoT rotation by evaluating and adjusting active damage-over-time
    effects for maximum damage output.
  description: The OptimizeDoTRotation method is responsible for managing and optimizing
    the application of damage-over-time (DoT) spells in the Warlock AI. It evaluates
    currently active DoTs on targets, determines whether new DoTs should be applied
    or existing ones refreshed, and ensures that the rotation maximizes overall damage
    per second (DPS). This method typically considers factors such as spell priorities,
    target debuff durations, and the Warlock's resource management to make optimal
    decisions about when and which DoTs to apply. The optimization process is crucial
    for maintaining high DPS during combat encounters and is part of the core AI decision-making
    loop.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    OptimizeDoTRotation();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the Warlock's main AI update loop
    and should be invoked regularly during combat to ensure optimal DoT management.
    It may interact with other internal methods like GetTarget(), HasSpell(), or CheckMana()
    to make informed decisions about spell casting.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method outside of combat or without proper
    target validation can lead to inefficient spell usage or potential errors in the
    AI's decision-making process. Ensure that the Warlock has valid targets and sufficient
    resources before calling this function.
