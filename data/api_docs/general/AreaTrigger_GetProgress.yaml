  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetProgress
  signature: float AreaTrigger::GetProgress() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the progress of the area trigger as a float value between 0.0 and
    1.0.
  description: The GetProgress method retrieves the current progression state of an
    AreaTrigger, typically representing how far along the trigger's activation or
    animation sequence has progressed. This value is usually normalized between 0.0
    (start) and 1.0 (complete), though it may exceed these bounds in certain edge
    cases depending on implementation details. The progress value can be used for
    visual effects, sound cues, or determining when specific actions should occur
    during the trigger's lifecycle. This method is commonly used in conjunction with
    area trigger events to synchronize gameplay elements such as particle effects,
    audio playback, or spell activations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the progress of the area trigger, typically
    ranging from 0.0 (beginning) to 1.0 (completion), though values outside this range
    may occur in special circumstances depending on the trigger's behavior and implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Progress Check
    code: "float progress = areaTrigger->GetProgress();\nif (progress >= 0.5f)\n{\n\
      \    // Trigger halfway point reached\n    // Activate secondary effects or\
      \ actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Progress for Visual Effects
    code: "float progress = areaTrigger->GetProgress();\nif (progress > 0.0f && progress\
      \ < 1.0f)\n{\n    // Update particle system intensity based on progress\n  \
      \  float intensity = progress * 255.0f;\n    // Apply to visual effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The return value is typically updated during the area trigger's active lifecycle,
    and may be interpolated between keyframes or events depending on how the trigger
    was defined in the game data. This method should not be called from within a critical
    section or high-frequency loop without considering performance implications.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this value for gameplay-critical decisions, as
    it might not always reflect exact timing due to interpolation or network synchronization
    delays in multiplayer environments. Also, values outside [0.0, 1.0] may indicate
    special states or bugs in the trigger's implementation.
