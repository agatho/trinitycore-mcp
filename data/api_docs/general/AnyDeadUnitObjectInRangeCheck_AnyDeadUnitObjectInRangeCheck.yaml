  class: AnyDeadUnitObjectInRangeCheck
  method: AnyDeadUnitObjectInRangeCheck
  signature: void AnyDeadUnitObjectInRangeCheck::AnyDeadUnitObjectInRangeCheck(int
    * searchObj, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a check for dead units within a specified range of an object.
  description: The AnyDeadUnitObjectInRangeCheck constructor initializes a predicate
    object used to detect whether any dead units exist within a given range of a specified
    search object. This is commonly used in AI behavior systems where mobs or players
    need to identify nearby deceased creatures or players for quest objectives, loot
    collection, or respawn-related logic. The check operates by iterating through
    nearby objects and evaluating their status as dead units against the provided
    range constraint.
  parameters:
  - name: searchObj
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the object from
      which to search for dead units. This typically corresponds to a GameObject,
      Creature, or Player GUID.
  - name: range
    description: Floating-point value specifying the maximum distance within which
      to search for dead units. Units beyond this range will be ignored in the check.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "int playerGuid = 12345;\nfloat searchRadius = 30.0f;\nAnyDeadUnitObjectInRangeCheck\
      \ check(&playerGuid, searchRadius);\n// Used within an AI decision-making context\
      \ to find nearby dead units\nif (check.IsInRange()) {\n    // Process found\
      \ dead units\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with TrinityCore AI System
    code: "class QuestGiverAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        int questObjectiveGuid = me->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \        float radius = 25.0f;\n        AnyDeadUnitObjectInRangeCheck check(&questObjectiveGuid,\
      \ radius);\n        \n        if (check.IsInRange()) {\n            // Trigger\
      \ quest completion or reward logic\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is typically used in conjunction with other TrinityCore AI components
    and requires proper initialization of the search object's GUID. The range parameter
    should be validated to prevent excessive performance impact during large-scale
    searches. The check may not account for all possible dead unit types depending
    on implementation details.
  warnings: Ensure that the searchObj pointer is valid and points to a live object
    when this check is invoked, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Be cautious
    with very large range values as they can cause performance degradation due to
    extensive object iteration.
