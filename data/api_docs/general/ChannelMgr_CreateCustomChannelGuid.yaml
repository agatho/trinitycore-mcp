  class: ChannelMgr
  method: CreateCustomChannelGuid
  signature: int ChannelMgr::CreateCustomChannelGuid()
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a unique global identifier for a custom channel within
    the TrinityCore system.
  description: The CreateCustomChannelGuid method is responsible for generating a
    unique global identifier (GUID) that can be used to identify custom channels in
    the World of Warcraft server environment. This GUID is typically used when creating
    new channels that are not part of the standard game channels, such as guild channels
    or custom user-defined channels. The method ensures that each channel receives
    a distinct identifier to prevent conflicts and maintain proper channel management
    within the TrinityCore framework. It operates within the ChannelMgr class which
    manages all channel-related functionality in the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the unique global identifier (GUID)
    for the newly created custom channel. This GUID is guaranteed to be unique within
    the current server instance and can be used to reference the channel in subsequent
    operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ChannelMgr* channelManager = sChannelMgr;

      int channelId = channelManager->CreateCustomChannelGuid();

      // Use channelId to create or reference a custom channel

      printf("Created custom channel with GUID: %d\n", channelId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when initializing new custom channels. The
    generated GUIDs are managed internally by the ChannelMgr class and should not
    be manually assigned or duplicated. The method may have internal locking mechanisms
    to ensure thread safety during GUID generation in multi-threaded server environments.
  warnings: Do not call this method excessively without proper resource management
    as it may impact performance. The returned GUID should be used immediately after
    generation to avoid potential conflicts if the system generates additional GUIDs
    concurrently.
