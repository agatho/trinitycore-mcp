documentation:
  brief: Processes loot decisions from a group to update coordination state
  description: The LearnFromLootDecisions method analyzes loot roll outcomes within
    a specified group to refine loot coordination strategies. It evaluates individual
    player decisions, such as passes or wins, and updates internal state to optimize
    future loot distribution decisions. This method is typically invoked after a loot
    roll concludes, allowing the system to learn from player behavior patterns and
    adjust its decision-making process accordingly. The method requires a valid group
    context and a valid roll identifier to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players who participated in
      the loot roll. Must be a valid group instance with active members.
  - name: rollId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific loot roll being processed. This
      ID must correspond to an existing roll within the system's tracking mechanism.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: "void ProcessLootRoll(Group* group, uint32 rollId)\n{\n    LootCoordination\
      \ coordination;\n    coordination.LearnFromLootDecisions(group, rollId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with loot manager
    code: "class LootManager\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleRollComplete(Group* group,\
      \ uint32 rollId)\n    {\n        // Perform roll completion logic\n        \n\
      \        // Update coordination based on decisions\n        lootCoordination.LearnFromLootDecisions(group,\
      \ rollId);\n        \n        // Continue with next steps\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and rollId parameters are valid and correspond
    to an active loot roll. It modifies internal coordination state, which may affect
    future loot distribution decisions. The implementation should be called after
    all players have made their decisions in a roll.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null group pointers will result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the rollId corresponds to a currently tracked
    roll; otherwise, the method may fail silently or produce incorrect coordination
    updates.
