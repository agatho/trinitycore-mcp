  brief: Sets the destroyed state of the object to indicate it is no longer valid
    for use in the game world
  description: The SetDestroyedObject method marks an Object instance as destroyed,
    signaling that it should no longer be processed or referenced in the game world.
    This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework when objects
    are removed from the world, such as when creatures die, items are picked up, or
    game entities are otherwise disposed of. Setting an object as destroyed prevents
    further processing of its update ticks and ensures proper cleanup of resources.
    The destroyed state affects how the object interacts with the game world's update
    systems and can influence visibility to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking a creature as destroyed
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->SetDestroyedObject(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting object destroyed in cleanup routine
    code: "void CleanupObject(Object* obj)\n{\n    // Perform any necessary cleanup\n\
      \    obj->SetDestroyedObject(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core framework and should
    not be invoked directly in most user code. The destroyed state is used to prevent
    further processing of the object during world updates, which helps avoid potential
    crashes or undefined behavior when accessing disposed objects.
  warnings: Direct usage of this method may lead to inconsistent game state if not
    properly coordinated with the object lifecycle management system. Improper use
    can cause issues with object references and memory management in the TrinityCore
    framework.
