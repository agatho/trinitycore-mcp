  signature: void IBotSpawner::SetBotToPlayerRatio(float ratio)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the ratio of bots to players in the world.
  description: The SetBotToPlayerRatio method configures the proportion of AI-controlled
    bots relative to real players within the game environment. This setting affects
    how many non-player characters (bots) are spawned or maintained in relation to
    active player characters. The ratio is typically expressed as a floating-point
    value where 1.0 represents one bot for every player, 0.5 represents half as many
    bots as players, and so forth. This method is commonly used in testing environments
    or custom game modes to control the density of AI presence. Changes made using
    this method may take effect immediately or at the next spawn cycle depending on
    implementation details.

  examples:
  - title: Set Bot-to-Player Ratio to 1:1
    code: botSpawner->SetBotToPlayerRatio(1.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Reduce Bot Density to 25% of Player Count
    code: botSpawner->SetBotToPlayerRatio(0.25f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal spawning logic and may not immediately
    affect existing bots in the world. It's recommended to call this before or during
    server initialization for consistent behavior.
  warnings: Setting extremely high ratios might cause performance issues due to increased
    AI processing overhead. Ensure that the value is within reasonable bounds for
    your server configuration.
