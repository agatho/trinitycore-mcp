  signature: void QuestPickup::ExecuteStrategy(Player * bot, QuestAcceptanceStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a quest acceptance strategy for a player bot.
  description: The ExecuteStrategy method processes a specified quest acceptance strategy
    for a given player bot. This method is typically used in AI-driven questing systems
    where the bot needs to determine how to handle quest acceptance based on predefined
    strategies. The strategy parameter defines the approach the bot should take when
    accepting quests, which may include conditions such as quest availability, player
    level requirements, or resource constraints. The method modifies the bot's behavior
    during quest acceptance without returning a value.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the quest acceptance strategy. Must not be null.
  - name: strategy
    description: The QuestAcceptanceStrategy enum value that defines how the bot should
      handle quest acceptance. This may include strategies like immediate acceptance,
      conditional acceptance, or deferred acceptance based on game state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteStrategy
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      QuestAcceptanceStrategy strategy = QuestAcceptanceStrategy::ACCEPT_IMMEDIATELY;

      questPickup->ExecuteStrategy(myBot, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ExecuteStrategy with conditional acceptance
    code: 'Player* bot = ...;

      QuestAcceptanceStrategy strategy = QuestAcceptanceStrategy::ACCEPT_CONDITIONAL;

      questPickup->ExecuteStrategy(bot, strategy);

      // Bot will accept quests only if certain conditions are met'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI questing framework in TrinityCore. It assumes
    that the player bot has been properly initialized and that the QuestPickup object
    is valid. The actual implementation of strategy handling depends on the specific
    QuestAcceptanceStrategy enum values defined in the codebase.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    null pointer dereference. The strategy parameter must be a valid enum value; invalid
    values may lead to undefined behavior or default strategy execution.
