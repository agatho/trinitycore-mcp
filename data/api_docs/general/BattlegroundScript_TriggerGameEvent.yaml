  class: BattlegroundScript
  method: TriggerGameEvent
  signature: void BattlegroundScript::TriggerGameEvent(int gameEventId, int * source,
    int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers a game event within the battleground context with optional source
    and target parameters.
  description: The TriggerGameEvent method is used to activate a specific game event
    within the context of a battleground. This function allows scripts to programmatically
    initiate events such as objectives, rewards, or state changes during battleground
    gameplay. The method accepts an event ID and optional pointers to source and target
    entities that may influence how the event is processed. It's typically used in
    custom battleground scripts to synchronize game mechanics with specific conditions
    or actions.
  parameters:
  - name: gameEventId
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to be triggered. This ID
      corresponds to an entry in the game_event table and defines what action or behavior
      will occur when the event is activated.
  - name: source
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the source entity for the game
      event. May be NULL if no specific source is required. The value typically represents
      a GUID or identifier of the object initiating the event.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity for the game
      event. May be NULL if no specific target is required. The value typically represents
      a GUID or identifier of the object affected by the event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MyBattlegroundScript::OnPlayerKill(Player* player, Player* killed)\n\
      {\n    TriggerGameEvent(12345, &player->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), &killed->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggering Event Without Source/Target
    code: "void MyBattlegroundScript::OnStart()\n{\n    TriggerGameEvent(54321, nullptr,\
      \ nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within a battleground script context.
    The game event must exist in the database for the trigger to have any effect.
    Be cautious when passing NULL pointers as source or target; ensure that the event
    handler properly handles such cases.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid gameEventId may result in undefined
    behavior or no effect. Ensure that all GUIDs passed through source and target
    parameters are valid and refer to existing entities in the current battleground
    context.
