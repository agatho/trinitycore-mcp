documentation:
  brief: Fits a difficulty curve to the provided data points for dynamic difficulty
    adjustment in World of Warcraft content.
  description: The DifficultyCurve::FitCurve method calculates and applies a mathematical
    curve that maps player progression or performance metrics to difficulty scaling
    factors. This functionality is essential for dynamically adjusting quest, dungeon,
    or raid difficulties based on player skill levels, ensuring appropriate challenge
    without being overly frustrating or trivial. The method typically processes input
    data such as player completion times, success rates, or performance scores to
    generate a smooth curve that can be used during gameplay to modify difficulty
    parameters in real-time.

  - title: Basic Usage for Difficulty Adjustment
    code: 'DifficultyCurve curve;

      curve.FitCurve();

      // Curve is now fitted and ready for use in dynamic difficulty calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs least-squares fitting or similar regression analysis
    to determine optimal curve parameters. It may be called during initialization
    of difficulty systems or when new player performance data becomes available.
