documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player has received level grants from RaF (Raid Finder)
    content.
  description: This method checks if a player has been granted additional levels through
    the Raid Finder content system, which typically occurs when players complete raid
    instances and earn rewards. The method returns true if the player has received
    level grants from RaF, false otherwise. This functionality is important for tracking
    player progression and ensuring proper reward distribution in the game's progression
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has been granted levels from Raid Finder content,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->HasBeenGrantedLevelsFromRaF()) {\n    // Player has received\
      \ RaF level grants\n    // Do something here\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore to track player progression
    and ensure proper reward distribution. The implementation may involve checking
    internal flags or state variables related to Raid Finder content completion.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining whether a player has completed
    RaF content, as it only indicates if levels have been granted. It's possible that
    players could have completed RaF content without having received level grants.
