  signature: bool SocialManager::SendChatMessage(ChatType type, const std::string
    & message, int target)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a chat message to the specified target player or channel.
  description: The SendChatMessage method is used to dispatch a chat message within
    the TrinityCore framework. It handles various chat types such as normal, whisper,
    guild, party, and system messages. The method takes a chat type, message content,
    and target identifier to determine where and how the message should be delivered.
    This function is typically invoked by game systems or player commands to facilitate
    communication between players or between players and the game server.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of chat message to send. Valid values include CHAT_TYPE_SAY,
      CHAT_TYPE_YELL, CHAT_TYPE_WHISPER, CHAT_TYPE_GUILD, CHAT_TYPE_PARTY, etc., as
      defined in the ChatType enumeration.
  - name: message
    description: The actual text content of the chat message. This string is sent
      to the target player or channel and may be subject to filtering or formatting
      based on game rules.
  - name: target
    description: The identifier of the target player or channel. For whispers, this
      is typically the GUID of the recipient. For other chat types, it might represent
      a group ID, guild ID, or channel index.
  returns: Returns true if the message was successfully queued for delivery; otherwise
    returns false if there was an error during processing or if the target could not
    be found.
  examples:
  - title: Send a whisper to a specific player
    code: "SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();\nif (socialMgr)\n{\n  \
      \  socialMgr->SendChatMessage(CHAT_TYPE_WHISPER, \"Hello there!\", targetGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcast a system message to the guild
    code: "SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();\nif (socialMgr)\n{\n  \
      \  socialMgr->SendChatMessage(CHAT_TYPE_GUILD, \"Guild meeting in 5 minutes.\"\
      , guildId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of a player's social manager and
    is part of the core communication system. It does not directly send messages to
    clients but rather queues them for processing by the network layer. The target
    parameter must be valid for the specified chat type, otherwise the message will
    not be delivered.
  warnings: Ensure that the target identifier corresponds correctly with the chat
    type being used; incorrect targeting can result in failed message delivery or
    unexpected behavior. Also, be mindful of spam prevention mechanisms and rate limiting
    that may affect message transmission.
