  class: ResourceManager
  method: HasEnoughResource
  signature: bool ResourceManager::HasEnoughResource(ResourceType type, uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has sufficient resources of a specified type to
    meet a required amount.
  description: The HasEnoughResource method determines if a player possesses at least
    the specified amount of a given resource type. This is commonly used in game mechanics
    such as spell casting, crafting, or item usage where resource consumption is required.
    The method typically interacts with internal resource tracking systems and returns
    a boolean value indicating availability. It may be called before performing actions
    that consume resources to prevent invalid operations.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The ResourceType enum value identifying the specific type of resource
      to check (e.g., mana, rage, energy, copper, etc.).
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of the specified resource that must be available for
      the method to return true.
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least the specified amount of the given
    resource type; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Sufficient Mana
    code: "if (resourceManager.HasEnoughResource(ResourceType::MANA, 50)) {\n    //\
      \ Cast a spell requiring 50 mana\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Verifying Resource Availability Before Crafting
    code: "uint32 requiredOre = 10;\nif (resourceManager.HasEnoughResource(ResourceType::ORE,\
      \ requiredOre)) {\n    // Proceed with crafting\n} else {\n    // Notify player\
      \ they don't have enough resources\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's resource storage system and
    may account for temporary modifiers or buffs that affect resource availability.
    It is generally non-blocking and fast, suitable for frequent checks during gameplay.
