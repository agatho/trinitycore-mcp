  class: InterruptManager
  method: IsPredictiveInterruptsEnabled
  signature: bool InterruptManager::IsPredictiveInterruptsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether predictive interrupts are enabled for the interrupt manager
    instance.
  description: The IsPredictiveInterruptsEnabled method checks and returns a boolean
    value indicating if predictive interrupts are currently enabled within the InterruptManager.
    Predictive interrupts in TrinityCore refer to a mechanism that allows for more
    responsive and accurate handling of spell interruptions based on timing and state
    changes, rather than relying solely on traditional interrupt triggers. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining proper gameplay mechanics related to spell casting,
    especially when dealing with abilities that can be interrupted by incoming attacks
    or other actions. The method does not modify any internal state and serves purely
    as a query function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether predictive interrupts are enabled (true)
    or disabled (false).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (interruptManager.IsPredictiveInterruptsEnabled()) {\n    // Handle\
      \ logic when predictive interrupts are active\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Predictive\
      \ interrupts are enabled.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle logic when predictive\
      \ interrupts are disabled\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Predictive interrupts\
      \ are disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell interruption handling
    systems to determine how spells should be processed during combat. It's important
    to note that enabling or disabling predictive interrupts may affect gameplay balance
    and should be done carefully.
