  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: IsObjectiveInRange
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::IsObjectiveInRange(int * player, const int & objLocation,
    float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is within a specified range of an objective location in
    a battleground.
  description: The IsObjectiveInRange method determines whether a given player is
    within the specified distance from a particular objective location within a battleground.
    This function is commonly used by battleground AI systems to evaluate player proximity
    to objectives such as flags, bases, or capture points. It performs a distance
    check between the player's current position and the provided objective coordinates,
    returning true if the player is within range and false otherwise. The method is
    typically called during battleground update cycles or event handling to trigger
    appropriate game logic based on player proximity to objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or position
      data. This parameter likely refers to a player GUID or coordinate reference
      used for distance calculations.
  - name: objLocation
    description: Reference to an integer representing the objective's location coordinates.
      This value typically contains the X, Y, Z coordinates of the objective in the
      battleground world space.
  - name: range
    description: Float value specifying the maximum distance within which a player
      is considered to be 'in range' of the objective. This defines the radius of
      the proximity check.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is within the given range of the objective
    location, false otherwise. The method evaluates the Euclidean distance between
    player and objective coordinates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground AI
    code: "if (bgAI->IsObjectiveInRange(&playerGUID, &flagLocation, 10.0f)) {\n  \
      \  // Player is within 10 yards of the flag\n    bgAI->HandleFlagCapture(playerGUID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Objectives
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < NUM_OBJECTIVES; ++i) {\n    if (bgAI->IsObjectiveInRange(&playerGUID,\
      \ &objectiveLocations[i], 5.0f)) {\n        // Player is near objective i\n\
      \        bgAI->ProcessObjectiveProximity(i);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the standard TrinityCore distance calculation functions
    for accuracy. The player parameter may be expected to point to a valid player
    GUID or coordinate data structure. Performance is generally good for single checks
    but could become significant in high-frequency scenarios with many players and
    objectives.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer and objective location values are valid
    before calling this method, as invalid pointers or coordinates could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. The range value should be positive; negative ranges will
    produce incorrect results.
