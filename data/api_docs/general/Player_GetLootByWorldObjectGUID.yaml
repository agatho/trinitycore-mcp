    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the loot associated with a specific world object GUID.
  description: This method returns the Loot object that is associated with a given
    WorldObject GUID. It serves as a lookup mechanism for retrieving loot data from
    the player's loot system, typically used when processing loot from game objects
    or creatures. The method ensures that the correct loot is returned based on the
    provided GUID, which is essential for proper loot handling in World of Warcraft
    gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to a Loot object associated with the specified world
    object GUID. If no loot is found for the given GUID, it returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Loot* loot = player->GetLootByWorldObjectGUID(12345);\nif (loot) {\n  \
      \  // Process loot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related methods
    and should be called within the context of a valid player object. Performance
    considerations include avoiding frequent calls to this method during loot processing
    loops.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return nullptr if
    no loot exists for the given GUID, potentially leading to null pointer dereferences
    if not properly checked.
