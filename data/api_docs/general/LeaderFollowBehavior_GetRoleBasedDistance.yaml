  method: GetRoleBasedDistance
  signature: float LeaderFollowBehavior::GetRoleBasedDistance(int role) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the distance threshold based on the role of the follower in the group.
  description: The GetRoleBasedDistance method retrieves a specific distance value
    that corresponds to the role assigned to a follower within a group. This distance
    is used by the LeaderFollowBehavior AI system to determine how closely a follower
    should maintain their position relative to the leader. The method takes an integer
    role parameter and returns a float representing the appropriate distance for that
    role. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, roles typically define
    different behavioral patterns such as tank, healer, or damage dealer, each with
    their own preferred positioning distances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the distance threshold associated with the specified
    role. The exact value depends on the internal configuration and role mapping defined
    within the LeaderFollowBehavior class.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve distance for a tank role
    code: float tankDistance = behavior.GetRoleBasedDistance(ROLE_TANK);
    language: cpp
  - title: Use returned distance in movement logic
    code: "float distance = behavior.GetRoleBasedDistance(currentRole);\nif (follower->GetDistance(leader)\
      \ > distance)\n{\n    follower->MoveTowards(leader, distance * 0.5f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI behavior system that manages group
    positioning and movement. The role parameter should correspond to predefined constants
    or enums used internally by the LeaderFollowBehavior class. The returned distance
    values are typically configured based on game balance requirements and may vary
    depending on the specific creature type or player class.
  warnings: Ensure that the role parameter passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to a defined role within the system. Passing an invalid role value could result
    in unexpected behavior or incorrect positioning logic.
