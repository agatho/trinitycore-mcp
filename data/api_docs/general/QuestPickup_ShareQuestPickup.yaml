api:
  class: QuestPickup
  method: ShareQuestPickup
  signature: bool QuestPickup::ShareQuestPickup(Group * group, uint32 questId, Player
    * initiator)
documentation:
  brief: Shares a quest pickup with all members of a group.
  description: The ShareQuestPickup method broadcasts a quest pickup notification
    to all players within the specified group. This functionality is used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to ensure that when one player
    initiates a quest pickup, other group members are informed and can potentially
    receive the same quest if they meet the requirements. The method handles the distribution
    of quest-related data across group members and ensures synchronization of quest
    state between players.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will receive
      the quest pickup notification. Must be a valid group instance.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being picked up. This ID must
      correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: initiator
    description: Pointer to the Player object who initiated the quest pickup. This
      player will be excluded from the broadcast if they are part of the group.
  returns: Returns true if the quest pickup was successfully shared with all group
    members, false otherwise. The method may return false if the group is invalid
    or if no valid players exist in the group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Pickup Sharing
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    bool result = QuestPickup::ShareQuestPickup(group,\
      \ 12345, player);\n    if (result)\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_NETWORKIO,\
      \ \"Quest pickup shared successfully.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Pickup Sharing
    code: "if (player->GetGroup() && player->GetGroup()->GetMembersCount() > 1)\n\
      {\n    uint32 questId = player->GetQuestStatus(12345)->GetQuestId();\n    if\
      \ (questId != 0)\n    {\n        QuestPickup::ShareQuestPickup(player->GetGroup(),\
      \ questId, player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player picks up a quest that should
    be available to their group members. It's important to note that the initiator
    player is excluded from receiving the notification to prevent duplicate processing.
    The method assumes that all players in the group are within the same instance
    or zone for proper synchronization.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, verify that the
    questId corresponds to an actual quest in the database to avoid invalid data transmission.
