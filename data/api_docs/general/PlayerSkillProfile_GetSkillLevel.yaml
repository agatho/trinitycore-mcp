  method: GetSkillLevel
  signature: float PlayerSkillProfile::GetSkillLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current skill level of the player as a floating-point value.
  description: The GetSkillLevel method returns the player's current skill level in
    the context of the PlayerSkillProfile. This value represents the proficiency or
    expertise level of the player in a specific skill, typically expressed as a decimal
    number that may include fractional components to indicate partial progress toward
    the next skill tier. The returned value is often used for gameplay calculations
    such as determining the effectiveness of skill-based abilities, crafting success
    rates, or spell damage multipliers. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point number representing the player's current skill level.
    The exact range and interpretation depend on the specific skill type and game
    mechanics, but typically ranges from 0.0 (untrained) to maximum possible skill
    value (e.g., 750.0 for maximum skill in classic WoW).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float currentSkill = player->GetSkillLevel();\nif (currentSkill >= 750.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Player has reached maximum skill level\n    sLog->outString(\"Player\
      \ is at max skill level.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Skill Level Check for Ability Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nfloat skillLevel\
      \ = player->GetSkillLevel();\nif (skillLevel >= 450.0f)\n{\n    // Allow advanced\
      \ ability usage\n    player->CastSpell(player, 12345, true); // Example spell\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Prevent casting or reduce effectiveness\n    player->SendSpellFailed(12345,\
      \ SPELL_FAILED_NOT_READY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related functions
    like GetSkillStep() or GetSkillModifier() to determine the full context of a player's
    skill state. It's important to note that this value might be affected by temporary
    buffs, debuffs, or game mechanics such as skill caps or diminishing returns.
  warnings: Be cautious when comparing floating-point values directly due to potential
    precision issues. Consider using epsilon-based comparisons for equality checks
    rather than direct == comparisons. Also, ensure the player object is valid before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
