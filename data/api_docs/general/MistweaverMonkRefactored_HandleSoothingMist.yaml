documentation:
  brief: Applies soothing mist effect to group members within range
  description: The HandleSoothingMist method implements the Mistweaver monk's soothing
    mist ability, which heals group members within a specified range. This method
    processes the healing application logic, including target validation, healing
    amount calculation based on the monk's stats and talents, and ensures proper cooldown
    handling. The method operates on a provided group identifier to determine which
    group members should receive the healing effect. It returns true if the ability
    was successfully applied to at least one target, or false if no valid targets
    were found or the ability failed for any reason.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group members should receive
      the soothing mist effect. Valid values are typically the group's unique ID or
      index within the player's party/raid context.
  returns: Returns true if the soothing mist was successfully applied to at least
    one group member, false otherwise. The method may return false if no valid targets
    exist in the specified group, cooldown conditions are not met, or other preconditions
    for the ability are not satisfied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of soothing mist on party group
    code: "if (monk->HandleSoothingMist(1)) {\n    // Successfully applied soothing\
      \ mist to party members\n    LOG_INFO(\"player\", \"Soothing Mist applied successfully\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // No valid targets or ability failed\n    LOG_WARNING(\"\
      player\", \"Failed to apply Soothing Mist\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using soothing mist with raid group validation
    code: "uint32 groupId = player->GetGroup() ? player->GetGroup()->GetId() : 0;\n\
      if (groupId > 0 && monk->HandleSoothingMist(groupId)) {\n    // Apply visual\
      \ effects and cooldown\n    player->AddAura(SPELL_SMOOTHING_MIST_AURA, player);\n\
      \    player->AddSpellCooldown(SPELL_SOOTHING_MIST, 0, 10000); // 10 second cooldown\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle failure case\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"No valid\
      \ targets for Soothing Mist\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's aura system and healing
    calculations. The group parameter should reference a valid group context within
    the current player's party or raid. The method may have internal cooldown handling
    that prevents multiple rapid applications, and it probably checks for line of
    sight and target validity before applying effects.
  warnings: Ensure that the group identifier passed to this method corresponds to
    an actual active group in the game world. Passing invalid group IDs may result
    in undefined behavior or no healing being applied. This method should only be
    called when the monk has sufficient mana and meets other ability requirements.
