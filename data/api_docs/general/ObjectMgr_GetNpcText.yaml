  brief: Retrieves NPC text data for a specified text ID
  description: The GetNpcText method retrieves the NPC text data associated with a
    given text ID from the object manager's internal storage. This method is used
    to fetch text entries that are typically displayed in NPC dialogues or quest interactions
    within the World of Warcraft game world. The returned pointer points to an array
    of integers representing various text components or related data fields for the
    specified NPC text entry. The method performs a lookup in the internal NPC text
    database and returns a const pointer to the data structure, ensuring that the
    retrieved data cannot be modified directly through this interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers representing the NPC text data
    for the specified text ID. Returns nullptr if no text entry exists for the given
    ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve NPC text
    code: "const int* npcText = sObjectMgr->GetNpcText(12345);\nif (npcText != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Process the NPC text data\n    printf(\"NPC Text ID %u retrieved\
      \ with %d entries\\n\", 12345, npcText[0]);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No NPC text\
      \ found for ID %u\\n\", 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal game data structures and should only be called
    from within the core game logic or appropriate subsystems. The returned pointer
    is valid only during the lifetime of the ObjectMgr instance and should not be
    stored for later use. The integer array returned may contain multiple values representing
    different text components or metadata fields.
  warnings: Do not modify the data pointed to by the returned pointer as it is const.
    The method returns nullptr when no matching text ID is found, so always check
    for null before using the result. This method should not be called during world
    loading phases when internal databases may not be fully initialized.
