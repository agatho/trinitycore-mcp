documentation:
  brief: Saves instance time restrictions for the player
  description: This method saves the time restrictions that are applied to instances
    for the player, including cooldowns and reset times. It ensures that the player's
    instance time restrictions are properly stored in the database so they can be
    retrieved on subsequent logins. The method is typically called when a player completes
    an instance or when their instance time restrictions change. This function handles
    the persistence of instance-related time data for the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->_SaveInstanceTimeRestrictions(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when instance
    time restrictions change. It ensures that time restrictions are properly saved
    to the database and can be restored on player login. The method may be called
    multiple times during a player's session, particularly when instance cooldowns
    change.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases as it is usually
    invoked automatically by the game engine. Direct invocation may lead to incorrect
    time restriction storage if not handled properly.
