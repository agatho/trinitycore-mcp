  class: TargetSelector
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const SelectionMetrics & TargetSelector::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the selection metrics object containing performance and evaluation
    data for the target selection process.
  description: The GetMetrics method provides access to a SelectionMetrics structure
    that contains detailed performance statistics and evaluation data from the target
    selection algorithm. This includes timing information, success rates, and other
    diagnostic data that helps developers understand how effectively the AI is selecting
    targets. The returned reference is const, ensuring that the metrics cannot be
    modified externally while still providing read access to all collected data. This
    method is typically used for debugging, performance monitoring, or integrating
    with AI analytics systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a SelectionMetrics object containing detailed performance
    and evaluation statistics from the target selection process. The metrics include
    timing data, success/failure counts, and other diagnostic information about the
    selection algorithm's behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Performance Monitoring
    code: 'TargetSelector selector;

      // ... some target selection logic ...

      const SelectionMetrics& metrics = selector.GetMetrics();

      std::cout << "Selection time: " << metrics.selectionTimeMs << "ms" << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Success rate: " << metrics.successRate << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Target Selection Issues
    code: "TargetSelector selector;\n// ... configure selector ...\nUnit* target =\
      \ selector.SelectTarget();\nif (target)\n{\n    const SelectionMetrics& metrics\
      \ = selector.GetMetrics();\n    // Log detailed selection performance\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Target selection took %u ms with %u attempts\", \n                   metrics.selectionTimeMs,\
      \ metrics.attemptCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned SelectionMetrics reference is valid only as long as the TargetSelector
    instance exists. The metrics are updated incrementally during target selection
    operations and may not reflect real-time data if accessed between different selection
    cycles. This method does not perform any computation or modification of internal
    state.
  warnings: Accessing metrics after a selector has been destroyed results in undefined
    behavior. The returned reference should not be stored beyond the lifetime of the
    TargetSelector instance. Be aware that frequent calls to GetMetrics() may impact
    performance if the metrics collection is extensive.
