  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: InitializeGroupState
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::InitializeGroupState(Group * group, GroupState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the group state for a player bot group, setting up internal tracking
    and synchronization data structures.
  description: The InitializeGroupState method prepares a GroupState object for use
    with a specific Group by populating it with initial values and establishing necessary
    internal references. This method is typically called when a player bot group is
    formed or when the group state needs to be reset or reinitialized. It ensures
    that all relevant group information such as member lists, roles, and synchronization
    flags are properly set up before the group begins its operational phase. The method
    does not perform any complex logic but rather sets up the foundational data structures
    needed for subsequent operations within the player bot AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that represents the player bot group
      to be initialized. Must not be null and should represent a valid group with
      at least one member.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to the GroupState object that will be initialized with
      data from the provided group. This object is modified in-place to reflect the
      current state of the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'Group* botGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);

      GroupState groupState;

      playerbotGroupScript->InitializeGroupState(botGroup, groupState);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization in Bot AI Context
    code: "void PlayerbotAI::OnGroupJoin()\n{\n    if (GetGroup())\n    {\n      \
      \  InitializeGroupState(GetGroup(), m_groupState);\n        // Now group state\
      \ is ready for use\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Group object passed in is valid and properly
    initialized. It does not perform any validation checks on the group itself, so
    callers should ensure the group is in a consistent state before calling this method.
    The method modifies the GroupState object directly, which means it's important
    to understand that the state will be changed in-place rather than returning a
    new object.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the group exists and is valid before calling
    InitializeGroupState. Additionally, if the group changes after initialization,
    the GroupState will not automatically update and must be reinitialized manually.
