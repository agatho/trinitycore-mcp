documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the nearest enemy within the specified
    range.
  description: The GetNearestEnemy method is used by AI-controlled creatures to identify
    and return the GUID of the closest hostile target within a given maximum range.
    This method is typically employed in combat decision-making logic, where the AI
    needs to determine which enemy to prioritize for attack or targeting. The method
    performs a search through the creature's current threat list or nearby units,
    filtering based on hostility and distance. It returns a pointer to an integer
    representing the GUID of the nearest valid enemy, or nullptr if no suitable target
    is found within range.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the nearest enemy within
    maxRange. Returns nullptr if no enemy is found within range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetNearestEnemy(30.0f))\n\
      \    {\n        AttackStart(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using returned GUID to perform actions
    code: "void BossAI::ExecuteEvent()\n{\n    if (int* enemyGuid = GetNearestEnemy(50.0f))\n\
      \    {\n        if (Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, *enemyGuid))\n\
      \        {\n            DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in creature AI implementations to make tactical
    decisions. The returned GUID should be validated before use, as the target may
    have been destroyed or moved out of range since the call. Performance-wise, this
    method may iterate through nearby units, so using a reasonable maxRange value
    is recommended.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no valid enemy is found within range.
    Always check for null before dereferencing the returned value. Additionally, the
    GUID returned might not remain valid if the target dies or is removed from the
    world between the time of call and when it's used.
