documentation:
  brief: Summons a trigger creature at specified coordinates with AI
  description: The SummonTrigger method creates and spawns a trigger creature at the
    given position (x, y, z) with an angle (ang) and specified despawn time. It allows
    for custom AI implementation through the provided CreatureAI function pointer,
    enabling developers to define specific behavior for the summoned creature. This
    method is commonly used in World of Warcraft scripting to create temporary or
    permanent trigger creatures that respond to player actions or events.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: X coordinate where the trigger creature will be spawned
  - name: y
    description: Y coordinate where the trigger creature will be spawned
  - name: z
    description: Z coordinate where the trigger creature will be spawned
  - name: ang
    description: Facing angle for the trigger creature's orientation
  - name: despawnTime
    description: Time in milliseconds before the creature despawns
  - name: GetAI
    description: Function pointer to custom AI implementation for the summoned creature
  returns: Creature * representing the summoned trigger creature, or nullptr if summoning
    fails
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Summoning Example
    code: Creature* trigger = this->SummonTrigger(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f, 5000,
      &CreatureAI::GetAI);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Trigger Summoning with Custom AI
    code: Creature* trigger = this->SummonTrigger(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f, 10000,
      [](Creature* creature) -> CreatureAI* { return new CustomAI(creature); });
    language: cpp
  notes: The method requires valid coordinates and angle values to properly spawn
    the creature. The despawn time parameter controls how long the creature remains
    in the world before being removed. This method should be used carefully as it
    can affect server performance if called frequently or with large numbers of creatures.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with large despawn times, as it may
    lead to memory leaks if not properly managed. Also, ensure that the AI function
    pointer is valid and does not cause null pointer dereferences.
