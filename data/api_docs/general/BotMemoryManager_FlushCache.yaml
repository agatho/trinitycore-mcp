  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: FlushCache
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::FlushCache(MemoryCategory category)
documentation:
  brief: Clears all cached memory entries for the specified memory category.
  description: The FlushCache method removes all cached entries from memory for a
    given MemoryCategory, effectively resetting the cache state for that category.
    This method is typically used to free up memory resources or to ensure that subsequent
    memory operations start with a clean slate. The operation is performed in-memory
    and does not persist changes to any external storage. It's commonly invoked during
    bot initialization, cleanup, or when memory pressure needs to be alleviated.
  parameters:
  - name: category
    description: The MemoryCategory enumeration value specifying which category of
      cached entries should be cleared. Valid values are typically defined within
      the MemoryCategory enum and may include categories such as UNIT, ITEM, SPELL,
      or GO (game object).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Flush all unit-related cached data
    code: 'BotMemoryManager memoryManager;

      memoryManager.FlushCache(MemoryCategory::UNIT);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Flush all cached data across multiple categories
    code: 'BotMemoryManager memoryManager;

      memoryManager.FlushCache(MemoryCategory::ITEM);

      memoryManager.FlushCache(MemoryCategory::SPELL);

      memoryManager.FlushCache(MemoryCategory::GO);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates synchronously and may block briefly depending on the
    size of the cache being cleared. It is safe to call from any thread, but care
    should be taken in multi-threaded environments where concurrent access to the
    same memory category might occur.
  warnings: Calling FlushCache on a heavily used memory category can cause performance
    degradation if done frequently or during high-traffic periods. Ensure that this
    method is not called excessively to avoid unnecessary overhead.
