  signature: void SpawnCircuitBreaker::SpawnCircuitBreaker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and activates the spawn circuit breaker mechanism for managing
    creature spawning in the game world.
  description: The SpawnCircuitBreaker::SpawnCircuitBreaker method is responsible
    for setting up and enabling the spawn circuit breaker functionality within the
    TrinityCore framework. This mechanism prevents excessive or uncontrolled creature
    spawning that could lead to performance degradation or server instability. The
    method typically initializes internal tracking structures, registers necessary
    callbacks, and prepares the system to monitor and regulate spawn events based
    on predefined thresholds or conditions. It is commonly invoked during server startup
    or when enabling specific spawn management features.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'SpawnCircuitBreaker breaker;

      breaker.SpawnCircuitBreaker();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during initialization. Multiple invocations
    may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The circuit breaker relies on
    internal counters and time-based checks to determine when spawning should be throttled.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within active spawn operations, as it may
    cause race conditions or inconsistent state management. Ensure that all necessary
    configuration parameters are set before invoking this method.
