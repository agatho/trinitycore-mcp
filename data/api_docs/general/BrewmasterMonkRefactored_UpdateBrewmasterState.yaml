  signature: void BrewmasterMonkRefactored::UpdateBrewmasterState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Brewmaster Monk's current state based on internal logic and player
    conditions.
  description: The UpdateBrewmasterState method is responsible for managing and updating
    the Brewmaster Monk's active state within the TrinityCore framework. This includes
    evaluating the monk's current abilities, cooldowns, resource levels (such as brew
    stacks), and combat situation to determine the appropriate next action or state
    transition. It typically integrates with the AI system to make decisions about
    when to use abilities like Keg Smash, Detox, or other Brewmaster-specific mechanics.
    The method ensures that the monk's behavior aligns with game rules and class-specific
    mechanics, such as managing the brew buff stack count and triggering appropriate
    animations or effects based on internal state changes.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BrewmasterAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    _brewmaster.UpdateBrewmasterState();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may trigger
    internal state transitions that affect the monk's behavior. It's important to
    ensure that this method does not cause performance bottlenecks, especially in
    high-density combat scenarios where multiple Brewmaster monks might be active.
