  class: HolyPaladinBeaconTracker
  method: SetSecondaryBeacon
  signature: void HolyPaladinBeaconTracker::SetSecondaryBeacon(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the secondary beacon for a Holy Paladin.
  description: The SetSecondaryBeacon method assigns a new GUID to the secondary beacon
    tracked by a Holy Paladin. This functionality is typically used in conjunction
    with the Beacon of Light spell mechanics, where paladins can maintain multiple
    beacons on different targets. The method updates the internal tracking state of
    the beacon system without triggering any visual effects or gameplay events directly.
    It is expected that this method will be called when a new target is selected for
    beacon placement or when an existing beacon needs to be reassigned.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit that will become
      the secondary beacon. Must be a valid GUID representing a player or creature
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a new secondary beacon
    code: "HolyPaladinBeaconTracker tracker;\nUnit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\n\
      if (target)\n{\n    tracker.SetSecondaryBeacon(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the provided GUID corresponds to a
    valid unit in the current map or if it's within range. It is assumed that the
    calling code has already performed necessary checks before invoking this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes when the beacon system attempts to reference the target later.
    Always ensure the GUID refers to a valid unit before passing it to this method.
