  signature: void DeathKnightAI::ExecuteSpecializationRotation(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the specialization-specific ability rotation for a Death Knight
    AI.
  description: The ExecuteSpecializationRotation method is responsible for performing
    the core ability rotation logic specific to a Death Knight's chosen specialization.
    This method evaluates the current combat state, available resources, and target
    conditions to determine and execute the most optimal sequence of abilities for
    the Death Knight's class and spec. It integrates with the AI's decision-making
    framework to ensure that abilities are cast in accordance with the tactical requirements
    of the current encounter. The method typically operates within a larger AI update
    loop and may involve cooldown management, resource tracking, and targeting logic
    specific to the Death Knight's abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The Unit object representing the current target for the Death Knight
      AI. This parameter defines the entity against which the specialization rotation
      will be executed. The target must be a valid Unit instance, and the method assumes
      that it is accessible and in a valid state for ability casting.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    ExecuteSpecializationRotation(mVictim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Resource Management
    code: "void AdvancedDeathKnightAI::ExecuteSpecializationRotation(Unit* target)\n\
      {\n    if (!target || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Check for\
      \ valid conditions before executing rotation\n    if (CanCastFrostStrike() &&\
      \ HasRunePower())\n    {\n        CastSpell(target, SPELL_FROST_STRIKE);\n \
      \   }\n    else if (CanCastBloodStrike() && HasBloodRunes())\n    {\n      \
      \  CastSpell(target, SPELL_BLOOD_STRIKE);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        //\
      \ Fallback to basic attack or other abilities\n        CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEATH_GRIP);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the AI's main update loop and
    should be called only when the Death Knight has a valid target. The method assumes
    that all necessary resource checks and cooldowns are handled internally by the
    AI framework. It is recommended to ensure that the target parameter is not null
    or invalid before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid target may result in undefined behavior
    or errors within the AI system. Ensure proper null checking and target validation
    before invoking ExecuteSpecializationRotation. Additionally, be aware that this
    method may modify internal AI state, so it should not be called during other concurrent
    operations that might interfere with its execution.
