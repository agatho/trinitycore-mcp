  class: Battleground
  method: ModifyStartDelayTime
  signature: void Battleground::ModifyStartDelayTime(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the start delay time of the battleground by the specified difference
    value.
  description: The ModifyStartDelayTime method adjusts the current start delay time
    of a battleground instance by adding the provided difference value to it. This
    method is typically used during battleground initialization or modification phases
    to control when players can enter the battleground. The adjustment affects the
    countdown timer that determines when the battleground will officially begin. The
    method does not validate whether the resulting delay time is positive or negative,
    and may result in unexpected behavior if the adjustment causes the delay to become
    excessively large or negative. This functionality is crucial for managing battleground
    timing mechanics such as pre-match delays, grace periods, or dynamic start times
    based on player count or server conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference (in milliseconds) to add to the current start
      delay time. Positive values increase the delay, while negative values decrease
      it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increase battleground start delay by 30 seconds
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      bg->ModifyStartDelayTime(30000); // Adds 30 seconds to the current delay'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reduce battleground start delay by 1 minute
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      bg->ModifyStartDelayTime(-60000); // Reduces delay by 1 minute'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal start delay timer of the battleground.
    It should be used carefully during battleground lifecycle events, particularly
    before the battleground has started. The change is immediate and affects all players
    currently in the queue or waiting to enter.
  warnings: Using this method with large negative values may cause the battleground
    to start immediately or even before it's properly initialized, potentially leading
    to undefined behavior or client-side issues. Ensure that any modifications maintain
    a reasonable delay time to allow for proper player preparation and entry.
