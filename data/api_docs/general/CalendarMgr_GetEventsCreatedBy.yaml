  signature: CalendarEventStore CalendarMgr::GetEventsCreatedBy(int guid, bool includeGuildEvents)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all calendar events created by a specific player GUID, optionally
    including guild events.
  description: The GetEventsCreatedBy method fetches a collection of calendar events
    that were created by a specified player identified by their global unique identifier
    (GUID). This function allows filtering based on whether guild events should be
    included in the result set. The returned CalendarEventStore contains all matching
    events, which can then be iterated or processed for display or manipulation within
    the game's calendar system. This method is typically used when displaying a player's
    personal event list or managing their calendar entries.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose created events
      are to be retrieved.
  - name: includeGuildEvents
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to include guild events in the
      returned event store. If true, both personal and guild events created by the
      player will be included; if false, only personal events will be returned.
  returns: A CalendarEventStore object containing all calendar events created by the
    specified player GUID. The store may be empty if no matching events exist.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a player's personal events
    code: CalendarEventStore events = calendarMgr.GetEventsCreatedBy(12345, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Retrieve both personal and guild events for a player
    code: CalendarEventStore events = calendarMgr.GetEventsCreatedBy(12345, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the calendar event storage system and may involve database
    queries depending on implementation. It is recommended to cache results when frequently
    accessed to improve performance. The returned CalendarEventStore should be handled
    carefully as it might contain a large number of events.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter corresponds to an actual existing player,
    otherwise the method will return an empty event store. Be cautious with including
    guild events if the player is not part of any guild or if guild data is not properly
    initialized.
