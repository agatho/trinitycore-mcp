  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: UpdateCombatPosition
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::UpdateCombatPosition(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat position of a bot AI based on leader-follow behavior mechanics.
  description: The UpdateCombatPosition method adjusts the positioning of a bot AI
    during combat scenarios, ensuring that the bot maintains an optimal distance and
    orientation relative to its leader. This method is typically invoked during combat
    updates to dynamically reposition the bot for better tactical advantage or to
    avoid unnecessary aggro. It integrates with the broader LeaderFollowBehavior system
    to maintain group cohesion while engaging enemies. The method does not return
    any value but modifies internal AI state variables related to positioning and
    movement.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance whose combat position will be updated.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid bot AI object in
      active combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat update loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate(BotAI* ai) {\n    if (ai->IsInCombat()) {\n        leaderFollowBehavior.UpdateCombatPosition(ai);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom AI logic
    code: "class CustomBotAI : public BotAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatUpdate()\
      \ override {\n        UpdateCombatPosition(this);\n        // Additional combat\
      \ logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's current target, leader position, and combat
    state to determine the appropriate positioning. It may trigger movement or adjustment
    commands internally but does not directly control character actions. Performance
    is generally low as it only recalculates positions when needed during combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer passed is valid and in a combat state; otherwise,
    unexpected behavior or crashes may occur. Avoid calling this method outside of
    combat update contexts unless explicitly required by custom logic.
