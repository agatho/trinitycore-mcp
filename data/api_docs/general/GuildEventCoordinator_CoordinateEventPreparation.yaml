  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::CoordinateEventPreparation(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Prepares and coordinates guild event-related activities for the specified
    event ID.
  description: The CoordinateEventPreparation method initializes and manages the setup
    process for a specific guild event identified by its unique event ID. This method
    is responsible for ensuring all necessary resources, permissions, and configurations
    are in place before an event can be executed or managed within the TrinityCore
    framework. It typically handles tasks such as validating event prerequisites,
    allocating required in-game resources, notifying relevant guild members, and setting
    up internal tracking mechanisms for event progression. The method operates synchronously
    and is designed to be called by the game's event management system when a guild
    event is scheduled or about to begin.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: A unique identifier representing the specific guild event to prepare
      for. This value must correspond to a valid event registered within the guild
      event system, typically obtained from event creation or scheduling operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Preparation
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CoordinateEventPreparation(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Preparing Multiple Events in Sequence
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\nfor (uint32 eventId : {1001, 1002,\
      \ 1003}) {\n    coordinator.CoordinateEventPreparation(eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the event ID provided is valid and has been previously
    registered with the guild event system. It may perform internal validation checks
    and could throw exceptions if invalid or unregistered event IDs are passed. The
    method should only be invoked during appropriate game states where event coordination
    is allowed.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent event ID may result
    in undefined behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that all event IDs are properly
    validated before invocation, especially when dealing with dynamic event creation
    or user-generated content.
