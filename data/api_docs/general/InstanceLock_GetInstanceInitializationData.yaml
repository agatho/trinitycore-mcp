documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the initialization data associated with an instance lock.
  description: The GetInstanceInitializationData method returns a constant pointer
    to the InstanceLockData structure that contains initialization information for
    the instance lock. This data typically includes details such as the instance ID,
    difficulty settings, and other metadata required to properly initialize or manage
    the locked instance. The returned pointer is valid only during the lifetime of
    the InstanceLock object and should not be stored or used after the parent object
    is destroyed. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework when handling instance locking mechanisms for dungeons, raids, or other
    grouped content.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an InstanceLockData structure containing initialization
    data for the instance lock. Returns nullptr if no initialization data is available
    or if the instance lock has not been properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();\nconst InstanceLockData*\
      \ data = lock->GetInstanceInitializationData();\nif (data)\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ initialization data\n    uint32 instanceId = data->instanceId;\n    uint8\
      \ difficulty = data->difficulty;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Instance Lock Validity
    code: "InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();\nconst InstanceLockData*\
      \ data = lock->GetInstanceInitializationData();\nif (data && data->instanceId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with instance-specific logic\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\"\
      , \"Player {} is in instance {} with difficulty {}\", \n              player->GetName(),\
      \ data->instanceId, data->difficulty);\n}\nelse\n{\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\"\
      , \"Invalid or uninitialized instance lock for player {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned InstanceLockData pointer is read-only and should not be modified.
    The data structure may contain sensitive information about the instance configuration
    that affects gameplay mechanics. This method does not perform any locking or synchronization
    internally, so thread safety must be handled by the caller if accessed from multiple
    threads.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the InstanceLock
    object, as it may become invalid. Always check for null returns before dereferencing
    the pointer to avoid segmentation faults. Improper handling of this data can lead
    to incorrect instance behavior or game state inconsistencies.
