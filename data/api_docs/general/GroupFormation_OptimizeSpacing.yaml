  class: GroupFormation
  method: OptimizeSpacing
  signature: void GroupFormation::OptimizeSpacing(float minDistance, float maxDistance)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the spacing between group members to maintain optimal distance thresholds.
  description: The OptimizeSpacing method in the GroupFormation class is responsible
    for dynamically adjusting the positioning of group members within a player group
    to ensure that each member maintains a minimum and maximum distance from others.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper group formation during combat,
    movement, or other gameplay scenarios where spatial awareness and positioning
    are important. The method operates on the current group's members and modifies
    their positions according to the specified minimum and maximum distance parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: minDistance
    description: The minimum allowed distance between group members. Must be a positive
      float value representing the minimum spacing in game units.
  - name: maxDistance
    description: The maximum allowed distance between group members. Must be a positive
      float value greater than or equal to minDistance, representing the maximum spacing
      in game units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupFormation formation;

      formation.OptimizeSpacing(2.0f, 5.0f); // Maintain 2-5 unit spacing between
      group members'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Values
    code: "float minDist = 1.5f;\nfloat maxDist = 8.0f;\nGroupFormation* formation\
      \ = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\nif (formation)\n{\n    formation->OptimizeSpacing(minDist,\
      \ maxDist);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group movement or combat situations
    to maintain proper formation. It may impact performance if used excessively in
    rapid succession due to the calculations required for positioning adjustments.
  warnings: Ensure that minDistance is not greater than maxDistance, as this could
    lead to undefined behavior. This method should only be called on valid group formations
    with active members.
