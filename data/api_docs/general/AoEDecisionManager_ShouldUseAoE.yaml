  signature: bool AoEDecisionManager::ShouldUseAoE(uint32 minTargets) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an area of effect ability should be used based on target
    count thresholds.
  description: The ShouldUseAoE method evaluates whether a given area of effect spell
    or ability should be activated based on the minimum number of targets required.
    This decision is typically made during AI behavior evaluation to optimize spell
    usage in combat scenarios. The method considers factors such as enemy density,
    spell range, and overall tactical situation to determine if using an AoE ability
    is more beneficial than single-target casting. It returns true when the calculated
    or configured target threshold has been met or exceeded, indicating that the AoE
    ability should be employed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the area of effect ability should
    be used. True signifies that the minimum target threshold has been satisfied and
    the AoE ability is recommended for use; false indicates that the conditions are
    not met to justify using the AoE ability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (ai->GetAoEDecisionManager()->ShouldUseAoE(3))\n{\n    // Cast AoE spell\
      \ if at least 3 targets are present\n    unit->CastSpell(target, AOE_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Target Count Evaluation
    code: "uint32 targetCount = ai->GetTargetCountInRadius(10.0f);\nif (targetCount\
      \ >= 5 && ai->GetAoEDecisionManager()->ShouldUseAoE(targetCount))\n{\n    //\
      \ Use AoE when 5 or more enemies are in range\n    ai->CastSpellOnTarget(AOE_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state tracking of the AI's current
    combat situation, including target positioning and spell availability. It may
    also consider cooldowns or resource requirements for the AoE ability before making
    a decision. The method is expected to be called frequently during combat evaluation
    cycles.
  warnings: Ensure that the minimum target count parameter is properly validated to
    avoid incorrect AoE usage when insufficient enemies are present. Improper use
    of this method could lead to inefficient spell usage or unnecessary resource consumption
    in combat scenarios.
