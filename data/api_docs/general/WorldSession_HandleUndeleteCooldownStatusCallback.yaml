  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleUndeleteCooldownStatusCallback
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleUndeleteCooldownStatusCallback(int result)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the result of an undelete cooldown status callback from the client.
  description: The HandleUndeleteCooldownStatusCallback method is invoked when a client
    responds to a cooldown status request related to character undeletion. This method
    processes the result code sent by the client, which indicates whether the undelete
    cooldown period has expired or is still active. The method likely updates internal
    session state or triggers further actions based on the cooldown status. It serves
    as part of the character management system in TrinityCore, specifically handling
    the logic for when a player can attempt to undelete a character after a cooldown
    period.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: An integer result code indicating the outcome of the client's cooldown
      status check. Values typically represent success (0), cooldown active (1), or
      error conditions (negative values).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleUndeleteCooldownStatusCallback(int result)\n{\n\
      \    if (result == 0)\n        SendUndeleteResult(UNDELETE_RESULT_SUCCESS);\n\
      \    else if (result == 1)\n        SendUndeleteResult(UNDELETE_RESULT_COOLDOWN);\n\
      \    else\n        SendUndeleteResult(UNDELETE_RESULT_ERROR);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the character undeletion system and should be called
    only when a client has responded to an undelete cooldown status request. It's
    expected that this method will update internal session state or communicate with
    the database to manage cooldown periods.
  warnings: Improper handling of the result code may lead to incorrect cooldown behavior,
    allowing players to undelete characters too frequently or preventing legitimate
    undeletions. Ensure all possible result values are properly handled.
