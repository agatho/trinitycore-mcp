    bool party)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an LFG status update message to the specified player or party
  description: The SendLfgUpdateStatus method is responsible for transmitting LFG
    (Looking For Group) status information to either a specific player or an entire
    group/raid. This method is typically invoked when there are changes in a player's
    LFG state, such as joining or leaving a group, or when the LFG queue status updates.
    The method handles both individual player notifications and party-wide updates
    depending on the 'party' parameter. It integrates with TrinityCore's LFG system
    to maintain synchronization of group finding states across clients.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player or party to receive the
      LFG update. For individual players, this is typically a player GUID. For parties,
      this represents the party's GUID.
  - name: data
    description: An LfgUpdateData object containing the specific LFG status information
      to be sent. This includes details such as current queue state, role preferences,
      dungeon eligibility, and other group finding parameters.
  - name: party
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the update should be sent to a party
      (true) or individual player (false). When true, the message is broadcast to
      all members of the specified party/group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send LFG update to a single player
    code: 'LfgUpdateData updateData;

      updateData.state = LFG_STATE_DUNGEON;

      updateData.dungeonId = 1234;

      // Send update to player with GUID 5678

      sLFGMgr->SendLfgUpdateStatus(5678, updateData, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Send LFG update to a party
    code: 'LfgUpdateData updateData;

      updateData.state = LFG_STATE_FINISHED;

      updateData.dungeonId = 5678;

      // Send update to party with GUID 9012

      sLFGMgr->SendLfgUpdateStatus(9012, updateData, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the TrinityCore LFG subsystem and relies on proper
    initialization of LFG data structures. The LfgUpdateData object must be properly
    populated before calling this method to ensure correct client-side behavior. Performance
    considerations include avoiding frequent calls for rapid state changes, as each
    call may trigger network transmission.
  warnings: Improperly configured LfgUpdateData objects can cause client-side LFG
    UI glitches or incorrect group states. The 'party' parameter must be correctly
    set to avoid sending messages to unintended recipients. Do not call this method
    without ensuring that the LFG subsystem is properly initialized.
