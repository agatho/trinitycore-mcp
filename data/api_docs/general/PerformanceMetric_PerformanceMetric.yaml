documentation:
  brief: Initializes a performance metric with type, value, GUID, and context information
  description: The PerformanceMetric constructor initializes a performance tracking
    metric with specified type, value, object GUID, and contextual data. This method
    is used to record performance-related measurements within the TrinityCore framework
    for monitoring and debugging purposes. The metric type determines how the data
    should be interpreted and aggregated, while the GUID identifies which entity (player,
    creature, GameObject, etc.) the metric relates to. Context provides additional
    information about where or why the measurement was taken, enabling more detailed
    analysis of performance characteristics across different systems and scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The metric type that defines how this performance data should be
      categorized and processed. Valid values typically include types like CPU_TIME,
      MEMORY_USAGE, NETWORK_PACKETS, etc.
  - name: v
    description: The numeric value of the performance metric. This represents the
      actual measurement being tracked (e.g., milliseconds for timing, bytes for memory
      usage).
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the object associated with this performance
      metric. For players, this would be their player GUID; for creatures, it's the
      creature GUID.
  - name: ctx
    description: A string context that provides additional information about where
      or why this metric was recorded. This can be used to categorize metrics by system,
      function, or location within the codebase.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Metric Initialization
    code: PerformanceMetric metric(MetricType::CPU_TIME, 1500000ULL, player->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),
      "MovementUpdate");
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Memory Usage for a GameObject
    code: PerformanceMetric memoryMetric(MetricType::MEMORY_USAGE, 4096ULL, go->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),
      "GameObject::Update");
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the performance monitoring
    system. The actual recording and aggregation of metrics happens elsewhere in the
    codebase. Developers should be aware that these metrics are often processed asynchronously
    to avoid performance impact on core game loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter is valid before calling this constructor,
    as invalid GUIDs may cause issues during metric processing or reporting. Also
    note that using large values for 'v' parameter could affect memory usage if many
    metrics are recorded simultaneously.
