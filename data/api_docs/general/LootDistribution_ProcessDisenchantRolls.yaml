  method: ProcessDisenchantRolls
  signature: uint32 LootDistribution::ProcessDisenchantRolls(LootRoll & roll)
documentation:
  brief: Processes disenchant rolls for a loot item and returns the number of players
    who rolled.
  description: The ProcessDisenchantRolls method handles the logic for processing
    disenchant rolls when a player initiates a disenchant action on a loot item. It
    evaluates all active rolls for the given loot item, determines the winner based
    on roll values, and updates the loot distribution accordingly. This method is
    typically invoked during the disenchanting process in World of Warcraft's loot
    system to ensure proper distribution of disenchanting results among players who
    participated in the roll.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the number of players who participated in the disenchant roll for
    the given item. A return value of zero indicates no active rolls were found or
    processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LootRoll roll;\nuint32 players_rolled = lootDistribution->ProcessDisenchantRolls(roll);\n\
      if (players_rolled > 0)\n{\n    // Handle successful disenchant roll processing\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Disenchant roll processed for %u players\", players_rolled);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot distribution system and should only be called
    when a valid loot item and associated roll are present. It assumes that the roll
    has already been initialized with proper data before being passed to this function.
