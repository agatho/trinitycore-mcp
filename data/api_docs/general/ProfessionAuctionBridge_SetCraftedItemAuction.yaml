  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::SetCraftedItemAuction(uint32 playerGuid,
    uint32 itemId, const CraftedItemAuctionConfig & config)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the crafted item auction configuration for a specific player and item.
  description: The SetCraftedItemAuction method configures the auction settings for
    a crafted item that a player has created. This method is typically used within
    the context of profession-based auctions in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server
    implementation, allowing players to set up their crafted items for auction house
    listing. The configuration includes details such as bid amount, buyout price,
    duration, and other auction parameters. This method likely updates internal auction
    data structures and may trigger notifications or database writes to persist the
    auction settings.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who created the crafted
      item. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: itemId
    description: The identifier of the crafted item being auctioned. This corresponds
      to the item's entry in the game's item database.
  - name: config
    description: A reference to the CraftedItemAuctionConfig object containing all
      auction parameters such as bid price, buyout price, auction duration, and other
      relevant settings.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CraftedItemAuctionConfig config;

      config.bidPrice = 10000;

      config.buyoutPrice = 50000;

      config.duration = 3600; // 1 hour

      ProfessionAuctionBridge::SetCraftedItemAuction(12345, 123456, config);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the auction house system and may require
    the player to have sufficient permissions or be in a valid state to create auctions.
    It may also trigger database updates or internal state changes that affect the
    auction listing.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid and itemId are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid identifiers could cause undefined behavior or database
    corruption. The config object should contain properly initialized values to avoid
    auction creation errors.
