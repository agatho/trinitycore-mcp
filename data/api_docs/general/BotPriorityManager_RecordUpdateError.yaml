  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: RecordUpdateError
  signature: void BotPriorityManager::RecordUpdateError(int botGuid, uint32 currentTime)
documentation:
  brief: Records an update error for a bot with the specified GUID at the given current
    time.
  description: The RecordUpdateError method logs or stores information about an update
    failure for a specific bot within the TrinityCore framework. This function is
    typically used in AI systems to track when bots fail to process updates, which
    can help diagnose issues with bot behavior, pathfinding, or other automated actions.
    The method takes the bot's unique identifier (GUID) and the current system time
    as inputs to record this error event. It does not return any value but contributes
    to internal tracking mechanisms that may be used for debugging, performance monitoring,
    or bot management purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that encountered an update
      error. This value must correspond to a valid bot entry in the system.
  - name: currentTime
    description: The current system time, represented as a uint32 value, indicating
      when the update error occurred. This timestamp is used for logging and tracking
      purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* manager = BotPriorityManager::instance();

      manager->RecordUpdateError(12345, time(nullptr));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal data structures or logs for error tracking.
    It is expected to be called during bot AI processing when an update fails. The
    implementation may involve thread-safe operations depending on how the manager
    is designed.
