documentation:
  brief: Sends a list of target icons to the specified session's client.
  description: The SendTargetIconList method is responsible for transmitting the current
    set of target icons associated with group members to a specific WorldSession.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining visual feedback in the user interface,
    allowing players to see which targets have been marked by group members. The method
    iterates through all group members and sends relevant icon data to the client,
    ensuring that the UI accurately reflects the current targeting state of the group.
    It's typically invoked when a player joins a group or when target icons are updated.

  - title: Sending Target Icon List to a Group Member
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SendTargetIconList(player->GetSession());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the Group system when changes
    occur in target icons or when a new member joins the group. It's important to
    note that this method only sends data to one specific session, not to all members
    of the group.
