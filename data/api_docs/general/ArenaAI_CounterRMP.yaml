  class: ArenaAI
  method: CounterRMP
  signature: void ArenaAI::CounterRMP(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Handles resource management for arena AI players during combat.
  description: The CounterRMP method in ArenaAI is responsible for managing and responding
    to resource usage by player characters within an arena environment. This function
    likely adjusts AI behavior based on player resource levels, such as mana, energy,
    or rage, to create more dynamic and challenging encounters. It may be invoked
    during combat updates to ensure that AI opponents react appropriately to player
    resource depletion or regeneration. The method operates on a pointer to an integer
    representing the player's current resource state.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's current resource
      level (e.g., mana points). This value is modified by the function to reflect
      updated resource states during arena combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Management Update
    code: "void exampleUsage() {\n    int playerMana = 100;\n    ArenaAI ai;\n   \
      \ ai.CounterRMP(&playerMana);\n    // playerMana is now updated based on AI\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's combat system and may be
    called frequently during arena battles. It's important to ensure that the referenced
    integer value remains valid throughout the function's execution.
  warnings: The parameter 'player' must point to a valid integer variable; passing
    a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The method modifies the pointed-to
    value directly, so callers should be aware of this side effect.
