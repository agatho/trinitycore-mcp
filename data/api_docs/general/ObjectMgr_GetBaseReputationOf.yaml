  class: ObjectMgr
  method: GetBaseReputationOf
  signature: int32 ObjectMgr::GetBaseReputationOf(const FactionEntry * factionEntry,
    uint8 race, uint8 playerClass) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the base reputation value for a given faction entry, race, and
    player class combination.
  description: The GetBaseReputationOf method is used to determine the initial reputation
    value that a player starts with when interacting with a specific faction in World
    of Warcraft. This value is determined by the faction's entry data, along with
    the player's race and class. The method serves as part of the game's reputation
    system, which governs how players interact with different factions, including
    their ability to gain or lose reputation through various in-game actions. It does
    not modify any state but rather provides a lookup value based on predefined game
    data.
  parameters:
  - name: factionEntry
    description: A pointer to the FactionEntry structure that defines the faction
      properties, including its base reputation settings.
  - name: race
    description: The player's race as a numeric identifier (e.g., 1 for Human, 2 for
      Orc). This affects the starting reputation value.
  - name: playerClass
    description: The player's class as a numeric identifier (e.g., 1 for Warrior,
      2 for Paladin). This also influences the base reputation value.
  returns: An int32 representing the base reputation value associated with the specified
    faction entry, race, and class. Negative values indicate hostility, zero indicates
    neutral, and positive values indicate friendship or respect.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Base Reputation for a Faction
    code: 'const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1234);

      int32 baseRep = sObjectMgr->GetBaseReputationOf(faction, RACE_HUMAN, CLASS_WARRIOR);

      // baseRep will contain the initial reputation value for a Human Warrior with
      faction 1234'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal faction data tables and assumes valid inputs.
    It is typically used during character creation or when initializing player-faction
    relationships in the game world.
