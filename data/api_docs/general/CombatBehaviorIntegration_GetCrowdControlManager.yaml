  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetCrowdControlManager
  signature: CrowdControlManager * CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetCrowdControlManager()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the CrowdControlManager instance associated with the CombatBehaviorIntegration.
  description: The GetCrowdControlManager method provides access to the CrowdControlManager
    object that handles all crowd control related logic within the combat behavior
    integration. This manager is responsible for tracking and applying crowd control
    effects such as stuns, fears, silences, and other interruptible abilities. The
    method returns a pointer to the active CrowdControlManager instance, which should
    be used carefully as it may be null if not properly initialized. This functionality
    is essential for implementing complex AI behaviors that respond to and apply various
    crowd control mechanics in World of Warcraft encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the CrowdControlManager instance if one exists, or nullptr
    if no manager has been initialized or assigned to this CombatBehaviorIntegration
    object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CrowdControlManager* ccManager = combatBehavior->GetCrowdControlManager();\n\
      if (ccManager != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the crowd control manager\n    ccManager->ApplyStun(target,\
      \ duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "CombatBehaviorIntegration* integration = unit->GetCombatBehavior();\nCrowdControlManager*\
      \ manager = integration->GetCrowdControlManager();\nif (manager && manager->IsCrowdControlled(unit))\n\
      {\n    // Handle unit that is currently under crowd control\n    return;\n}\n\
      // Proceed with normal behavior"
    language: cpp
  notes: The CrowdControlManager instance returned by this method is typically initialized
    during the setup phase of a combat behavior integration. Developers should ensure
    proper initialization before calling this method to avoid null pointer dereferences.
    The manager's lifetime is managed by the CombatBehaviorIntegration object, so
    no manual memory management is required.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly configured CombatBehaviorIntegration
    may return a nullptr, leading to potential crashes if not properly checked. Always
    verify that the returned pointer is valid before using it in any crowd control
    operations.
