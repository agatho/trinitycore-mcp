documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item template represents a weapon type.
  description: The IsWeapon() method checks if the current ItemTemplate instance corresponds
    to an item that is classified as a weapon. This includes all melee weapons, ranged
    weapons, and thrown weapons. The method evaluates the item's class and subclass
    to determine if it falls under the weapon category according to the game's item
    classification system. This check is commonly used in gameplay logic to differentiate
    between weapon and non-weapon items for various mechanics such as damage calculation,
    weapon slot validation, and combat-related behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item template represents a weapon (melee, ranged, or
    thrown), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (itemTemplate->IsWeapon()) {\n    // Apply weapon-specific damage calculations\n\
      \    ApplyWeaponDamage(player, itemTemplate);\n} else {\n    // Handle non-weapon\
      \ items\n    HandleNonWeaponItem(player, itemTemplate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Weapon Type for Equipment Validation
    code: "void ValidateEquipment(Player* player) {\n    ItemTemplate const* template\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(player->GetEquippedItemBySlot(SLOT_MAIN_HAND));\n\
      \    if (template && template->IsWeapon()) {\n        // Main hand item is a\
      \ weapon, proceed with weapon checks\n        CheckWeaponRequirements(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the item's class and subclass values being properly
    initialized. The implementation internally checks if the item's class equals ITEM_CLASS_WEAPON
    (1) and validates that the subclass falls within valid weapon subclasses. This
    check is efficient and should not cause performance issues in normal gameplay
    scenarios.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only evaluates the item template's classification,
    not the actual equipped state or enchantments of an item instance. An item may
    be classified as a weapon but still be unusable due to level requirements or other
    restrictions.
