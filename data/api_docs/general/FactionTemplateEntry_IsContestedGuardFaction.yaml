documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the faction template represents a contested guard faction.
  description: The IsContestedGuardFaction method checks if the current faction template
    entry is designated as a contested guard faction. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    contested guard factions are typically used for areas where multiple factions
    control territory and guards are set to attack players from opposing factions.
    This method returns true if the faction template has the contested guard flag
    set, indicating that guards in this faction will engage players based on faction
    standing and territorial control rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the faction template is a contested guard faction; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Faction is Contested Guard
    code: "FactionTemplateEntry* factionEntry = sFactionTemplateStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (factionEntry && factionEntry->IsContestedGuardFaction())\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ contested guard faction logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Faction 1234 is a contested\
      \ guard faction.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal faction template flags that are defined in
    the game's database. The contested guard flag is typically set for factions associated
    with contested territories such as battlegrounds or zones where faction control
    changes dynamically.
