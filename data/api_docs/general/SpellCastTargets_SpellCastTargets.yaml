  method: SpellCastTargets
  signature: void SpellCastTargets::SpellCastTargets(Unit * caster, const WorldPackets::Spells::SpellCastRequest
    & spellCastRequest)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes spell cast targets for a unit based on a spell cast request packet
  description: The SpellCastTargets constructor initializes the target information
    for a spell cast operation by parsing the provided spell cast request packet.
    It processes the caster unit and extracts relevant targeting data including unit
    targets, item targets, and object targets from the packet. This method is typically
    invoked during spell casting logic to prepare target data before spell execution.
    The initialization ensures that all target-related information is correctly set
    up for subsequent spell validation and application.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is casting the spell. This represents
      the source of the spell cast operation and must be a valid unit instance.
  - name: spellCastRequest
    description: Reference to the WorldPackets::Spells::SpellCastRequest packet containing
      the spell casting data including target information, spell ID, and other casting
      parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Cast Targets Initialization
    code: 'Unit* caster = player;

      WorldPackets::Spells::SpellCastRequest request;

      // Populate request with spell data

      SpellCastTargets targets(caster, request);

      // targets is now initialized with caster and target information'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs no direct validation of the spell cast request. It assumes
    that the provided packet contains valid data. The initialization process may involve
    parsing multiple target types including unit, item, and object targets. This constructor
    is typically called internally by the spell system during spell processing.
