  class: RogueAI
  method: HasEnoughEnergy
  signature: bool RogueAI::HasEnoughEnergy(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the rogue has sufficient energy to perform an action
  description: The HasEnoughEnergy method evaluates whether the current rogue AI character
    possesses enough energy (mana) to execute a specified ability or attack. This
    method is crucial for decision-making in the rogue's AI behavior, ensuring that
    actions are only attempted when the character can afford the energy cost. The
    check considers the rogue's current energy pool against the required amount, taking
    into account any energy regeneration mechanics or temporary energy boosts that
    may be active.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The required energy amount needed to perform the action. This value
      represents the energy cost of the ability or attack being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the rogue has equal to or more than the specified energy
    amount, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Energy Check
    code: "if (rogueAI->HasEnoughEnergy(30)) {\n    // Perform an ability that costs\
      \ 30 energy\n    rogueAI->CastAbility(SINISTER_STRIKE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Action Based on Energy
    code: "uint32 energyCost = 45;\nif (rogueAI->HasEnoughEnergy(energyCost)) {\n\
      \    rogueAI->CastAbility(ENVENOM);\n} else if (rogueAI->HasEnoughEnergy(20))\
      \ {\n    rogueAI->CastAbility(SINISTER_STRIKE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before attempting to use any energy-consuming
    abilities. The energy value is typically represented in game units and may vary
    based on the rogue's level, gear, and buffs. The method does not modify the character's
    energy state; it only performs a read-only check.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency loops as it may impact
    performance if called excessively without caching results. Also, ensure that the
    energy amount passed is valid (non-negative) to avoid unexpected behavior.
