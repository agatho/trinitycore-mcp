  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: SetUpdateFrequency
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::SetUpdateFrequency(uint32 botGuid, uint32 frequencyMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update frequency for a specific bot's objective tracking.
  description: The SetUpdateFrequency method configures how often a bot's objective
    tracker updates its display or internal state. This is particularly useful in
    World of Warcraft TrinityCore environments where bots need to synchronize their
    quest and objective progress with the game world at specified intervals. The method
    accepts a bot's unique identifier and a frequency value in milliseconds, determining
    how frequently the bot's objectives should be refreshed or checked for changes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot whose objective tracking
      frequency is being set. This GUID must correspond to a valid bot entity within
      the TrinityCore instance.
  - name: frequencyMs
    description: The update frequency in milliseconds. This value determines how often
      the bot's objectives are checked or updated. Lower values result in more frequent
      updates but may impact performance, while higher values reduce frequency but
      could cause delays in objective synchronization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: ObjectiveTracker::SetUpdateFrequency(12345, 1000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting High Frequency for Real-time Updates
    code: ObjectiveTracker::SetUpdateFrequency(botGuid, 100); // Update every 100ms
      for real-time tracking
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal tracking structures within the ObjectiveTracker
    class. It is recommended to avoid setting extremely low frequencies (e.g., below
    50ms) as this can cause performance degradation in high-load scenarios. The frequency
    setting may be applied immediately or queued for execution depending on the implementation
    details of the ObjectiveTracker system.
  warnings: Setting update frequencies too low can lead to excessive CPU usage and
    potential server lag, especially when multiple bots are active. Ensure that the
    botGuid provided is valid and corresponds to an existing bot entity; otherwise,
    the method may silently fail or produce undefined behavior.
