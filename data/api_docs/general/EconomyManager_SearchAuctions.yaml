  class: EconomyManager
  method: SearchAuctions
  signature: int EconomyManager::SearchAuctions(uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Searches for active auctions containing the specified item and returns the
    count of matching auctions.
  description: The SearchAuctions method queries the auction house system to find
    all currently active auctions that list the specified item. It performs a database
    lookup to retrieve auction entries matching the given item ID, counting how many
    such auctions exist. This method is typically used by the auction house UI or
    backend systems to determine inventory availability and market presence for specific
    items. The method does not modify any state and is read-only in nature. It assumes
    that the item ID provided is valid and corresponds to an existing item in the
    game database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of active auctions found for
    the specified item ID. A return value of 0 indicates no auctions are currently
    active for that item, while a positive integer indicates the count of matching
    auction entries.
  examples:
  - title: Find Auction Count for Iron Ore
    code: "int auctionCount = economyManager->SearchAuctions(2842); // Iron Ore\n\
      if (auctionCount > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Found %d auctions for Iron Ore\\n\",\
      \ auctionCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a database query against the auction table, so
    frequent calls may impact performance. It's recommended to cache results when
    searching for the same item multiple times within short periods. The method is
    const, meaning it does not modify internal state of the EconomyManager object.
  warnings: The method assumes valid itemId input; passing an invalid or non-existent
    item ID may result in unexpected behavior or database errors. Ensure that itemId
    corresponds to a real item in the game's item database before calling this method.
