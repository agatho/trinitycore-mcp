  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleModManaRegenPct(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the percentage of mana regeneration rate for the affected unit.
  description: The HandleModManaRegenPct method is responsible for applying or removing
    a percentage-based modification to the target's mana regeneration rate. This aura
    effect adjusts how quickly a unit regenerates mana over time, either increasing
    or decreasing the base regeneration based on the applied modifier. The method
    is typically invoked during aura application or removal events and operates on
    the AuraApplication context to determine the affected unit and apply the appropriate
    changes to its mana regeneration properties.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      the aura being applied or removed. This parameter determines which unit is affected
      and provides access to aura-specific data.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation for the aura effect, typically indicating whether
      it's being applied (1) or removed (0). This value influences how the mana regeneration
      modifier is processed.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the aura effect. When true, the percentage modifier is added; when false, it's
      removed from the unit's mana regeneration rate.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a 20% increase to mana regeneration
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      uint8 mode = 1;

      bool apply = true;

      effect->HandleModManaRegenPct(app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a mana regeneration modifier
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      uint8 mode = 0;

      bool apply = false;

      effect->HandleModManaRegenPct(app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the unit's mana regeneration rate by modifying
    a percentage value. It is part of the aura system and should be called only when
    processing aura applications or removals. The implementation relies on the AuraApplication
    context to determine which unit is affected and what specific modifier to apply.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method can lead to incorrect mana regeneration
    behavior for players or NPCs. Ensure that the aura application context is valid
    before calling this method, as invalid pointers may cause crashes or undefined
    behavior.
