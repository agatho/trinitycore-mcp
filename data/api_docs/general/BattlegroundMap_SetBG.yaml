  class: BattlegroundMap
  method: SetBG
  signature: void BattlegroundMap::SetBG(Battleground * bg)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a battleground instance to this map, linking the map to a specific
    battleground object for game logic and management.
  description: The SetBG method is used to associate a Battleground object with a
    BattlegroundMap instance. This linkage is essential for managing battleground-specific
    data, such as player assignments, scoring, and objective states. The method typically
    gets called during battleground initialization or when a new battleground instance
    is created. It ensures that the map correctly references its associated battleground,
    enabling proper game state management and event handling within the context of
    that specific battleground. This connection allows for accurate tracking of players,
    objectives, and overall battleground progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a battleground instance on a map
    code: "Battleground* bg = new BattlegroundAV();\nBattlegroundMap* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(489,\
      \ 0);\nif (map)\n{\n    map->SetBG(bg);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the battleground system during
    initialization. It's important to ensure that the Battleground pointer passed
    is valid and properly initialized before calling this method. The method does
    not perform any validation on the input parameter, so callers must ensure correctness.
  warnings: Calling SetBG with a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Ensure
    that the battleground object exists and is properly constructed before assigning
    it to the map. This method should only be called once per map instance during
    initialization.
