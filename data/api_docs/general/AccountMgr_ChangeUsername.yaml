    newUsername, std::string newPassword)
documentation:
  brief: Changes the username and password for a specified account ID
  description: The ChangeUsername method updates the username and password associated
    with a given account identifier in the TrinityCore database. This function performs
    validation on the new username and password to ensure they meet game policy requirements,
    such as minimum length and character restrictions. It returns an AccountOpResult
    indicating success or failure of the operation, which can be used to provide appropriate
    feedback to the user or log administrative actions. The method is typically invoked
    during account management operations where users request to modify their login
    credentials.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier of the account whose username and password are
      to be changed. Must correspond to an existing account in the database.
  - name: newUsername
    description: The new username to assign to the account. Must be unique, non-empty,
      and conform to game policy restrictions (e.g., length limits, allowed characters).
  - name: newPassword
    description: The new password for the account. Should meet security requirements
      such as minimum length and complexity rules defined by the server configuration.
  returns: An AccountOpResult enum value indicating the outcome of the operation.
    Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED_ALREADY_EXIST, FAILED_NOT_FOUND, FAILED_INVALID_INPUT,
    or other error codes depending on validation or database issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "AccountOpResult result = AccountMgr::ChangeUsername(12345, \"newuser\"\
      , \"securepass123\");\nif (result == AccountOpResult::SUCCESS) {\n    printf(\"\
      Username and password updated successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to update account credentials.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the database and should only be called
    from trusted administrative contexts or validated user sessions. It does not perform
    any automatic session invalidation, so existing login sessions may remain valid
    after a username change.
  warnings: Changing account credentials can affect active sessions; ensure proper
    handling of session management if needed. The method assumes that input parameters
    have been sanitized and validated before being passed to prevent injection attacks
    or invalid data corruption.
