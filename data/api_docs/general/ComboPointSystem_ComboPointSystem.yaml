  method: ComboPointSystem
  signature: void ComboPointSystem::ComboPointSystem()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ComboPointSystem instance with default values and internal
    state setup.
  description: The ComboPointSystem constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ComboPointSystem class. This method sets up the internal data structures required
    for managing combo points for players or units within the TrinityCore framework.
    It ensures that all member variables are properly initialized to their default
    states, preparing the system for tracking and updating combo point counts during
    gameplay. The constructor is typically invoked automatically when creating a new
    ComboPointSystem object, and it does not accept any parameters. This initialization
    process is crucial for maintaining accurate combo point tracking in abilities
    such as Slice and Dice, Eviscerate, or other combo-point generating skills.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a ComboPointSystem instance
    code: 'ComboPointSystem system;

      // The system is now initialized and ready to track combo points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal implementation of the combo point
    tracking system in TrinityCore. Developers should not directly instantiate ComboPointSystem
    objects unless working with low-level game mechanics or extending core functionality.
    The system typically integrates with player and unit classes to automatically
    manage combo points during combat.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of ComboPointSystem is generally not recommended
    for standard addon development. The class is intended to be used internally by
    the core TrinityCore systems, and improper usage may lead to undefined behavior
    or inconsistent combo point tracking.
