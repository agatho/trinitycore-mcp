  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleOverrideAttackPowerBySpellPower(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes the override attack power bonus from spell power aura
    effect.
  description: This method handles the application and removal of an aura effect that
    modifies a unit's attack power based on its spell power. When applied, it calculates
    and sets the override attack power value using the spell power of the affected
    unit. The effect is typically used by spells that grant increased attack power
    proportional to spell power, such as certain warlock or priest abilities. This
    method is called internally by the aura system during aura application or removal
    events.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. Contains information about the aura and its target.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation, typically indicating whether this is an application
      (1) or removal (0) event. Used for internal state management.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the aura effect from the target unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Application
    code: "void ApplySpellPowerAttackOverride(AuraEffect* auraEffect, Unit* target)\n\
      {\n    AuraApplication* aurApp = new AuraApplication(target, target, auraEffect);\n\
      \    auraEffect->HandleOverrideAttackPowerBySpellPower(aurApp, 1, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Aura Removal Example
    code: "void RemoveSpellPowerAttackOverride(AuraEffect* auraEffect, Unit* target)\n\
      {\n    AuraApplication* aurApp = new AuraApplication(target, target, auraEffect);\n\
      \    auraEffect->HandleOverrideAttackPowerBySpellPower(aurApp, 1, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the unit's attack power override value. It
    should only be called from within the aura application/removal system. The calculation
    of attack power from spell power is handled internally by the method and depends
    on the aura's base values and modifiers.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without proper aura context. Incorrect
    usage can lead to inconsistent stat calculations and unexpected behavior in combat
    mechanics.
