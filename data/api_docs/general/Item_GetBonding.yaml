  method: GetBonding
  signature: ItemBondingType Item::GetBonding() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bonding type of the item, indicating how it binds to the player
    upon pickup.
  description: The GetBonding method retrieves the ItemBondingType value that determines
    how an item is bound when picked up by a player. This binding type controls whether
    the item can be bound to the player's account, character, or guild, and affects
    gameplay mechanics such as auction house behavior, quest completion, and item
    usage. The method returns one of several predefined bonding types including none,
    bind on pickup, bind on equip, bind on use, or bind to account. This information
    is crucial for understanding item properties and their interaction with game systems
    like auction houses, quest rewards, and player inventory management.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns the ItemBondingType enum value which represents the binding type
    of the item. Possible values include: ITEM_BOND_NONE (0), ITEM_BOND_ON_PICKUP
    (1), ITEM_BOND_ON_EQUIP (2), ITEM_BOND_ON_USE (3), and ITEM_BOND_TO_ACCOUNT (4).
    These values determine how the item binds to the player upon pickup or use.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(12345);\nItemBondingType bondingType\
      \ = item->GetBonding();\nif (bondingType == ITEM_BOND_ON_PICKUP)\n{\n    //\
      \ Item will bind to player on pickup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    return value is determined by the item's database fields and does not change during
    gameplay unless explicitly modified through game mechanics or code.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if an item is bound to account,
    as it only returns the bonding type, not the actual binding status. The item may
    still be bound to account even if the bonding type is ITEM_BOND_ON_PICKUP.
