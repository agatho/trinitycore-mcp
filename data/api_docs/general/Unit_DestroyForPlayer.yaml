documentation:
  brief: Destroys a unit for a specific player, removing it from their visible world.
  description: The DestroyForPlayer method is used to remove a unit from a player's
    visible world, effectively making it disappear from the player's perspective.
    This method is typically used in scenarios where a unit needs to be hidden or
    removed from a player's view, such as during quest completion, combat resolution,
    or when a unit is no longer relevant to the player's current objectives. The method
    operates by sending a packet to the player's client that removes the unit from
    their visible world, ensuring that the unit does not appear in their minimap or
    in their character's vision.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID or target index.
      This parameter specifies which player's view the unit should be removed from.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->DestroyForPlayer(&playerId);

      // Unit is now hidden from player''s view'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the visibility of units
    in the game world. It may have performance implications when dealing with many
    units or players, and should be called only when necessary to avoid unnecessary
    client updates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to visual inconsistencies in the
    game world, where units might appear or disappear unexpectedly. Also, calling
    this method on a unit that is already destroyed may cause undefined behavior or
    crashes.
