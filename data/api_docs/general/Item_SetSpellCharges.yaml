  class: Item
  method: SetSpellCharges
  signature: void Item::SetSpellCharges(const int * effect, int32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the charge amount for a spell associated with an item.
  description: This method allows developers to modify the charge count of a spell
    that is linked to an item, typically used in conjunction with item enchantments
    or spell effects. The method updates the internal state of the item's spell charges,
    which can affect gameplay mechanics such as cooldowns and usage limits. It is
    commonly used during item creation or modification processes where specific spell
    effects need to be adjusted.
  parameters:
  - name: effect
    description: Pointer to the effect index that identifies which spell effect should
      be modified. This typically corresponds to a specific spell in the item's enchantment
      or spell list.
  - name: value
    description: The new charge value to assign to the specified spell effect. This
      can be positive or negative, and represents how many times the spell can be
      used before it expires.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Spell Charges for Item
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetSpellCharges(&effect, 5);

      // Sets the charge count of spell effect to 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related methods
    like SetSpellCharges or Item::AddSpell. It requires careful handling of effect
    indices to avoid incorrect assignment of charges. Performance considerations include
    avoiding unnecessary calls when the charge value does not change.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell usage, potentially
    causing items to behave unexpectedly in-game. Care must be taken to ensure that
    the effect pointer points to valid spell indices within the item's structure.
