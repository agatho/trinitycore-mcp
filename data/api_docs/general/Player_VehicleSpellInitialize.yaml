  brief: Initializes vehicle-related spells for the player when they board a vehicle
  description: The VehicleSpellInitialize method sets up and applies all necessary
    vehicle-specific spells and abilities to a player when they mount or board a vehicle.
    This includes granting vehicle seat spells, removing passenger spells, and configuring
    the player's spell book to reflect their vehicle riding capabilities. The method
    is typically called internally by the game engine during vehicle mounting operations
    and ensures that the player can properly interact with the vehicle's controls
    and abilities. It handles the transition from player-only spells to vehicle-specific
    spell sets, including any required aura applications or spell removals.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Vehicle mounting spell initialization
    code: "void Player::OnVehicleBoard(Vehicle* vehicle)\n{\n    // Called when player\
      \ boards a vehicle\n    VehicleSpellInitialize();\n    // Additional vehicle\
      \ boarding logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically invoked during vehicle mounting operations and
    should not typically be called directly by external code. The implementation handles
    spell removals, additions, and aura applications necessary for proper vehicle
    functionality. It's part of the core vehicle system integration within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless implementing custom vehicle behavior.
    Calling it outside of normal vehicle mounting procedures may result in incorrect
    spell states or game state inconsistencies. The method assumes the player is actually
    boarding a valid vehicle with proper seat information.
