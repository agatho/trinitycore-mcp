documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for arcane mage abilities
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up the initial state of all cooldown
    timers for an arcane mage's spells and abilities. This method is typically called
    during player initialization or when a new arcane mage character is created to
    ensure that all spell cooldowns are properly reset and tracked. The method configures
    internal cooldown structures and ensures that no abilities appear on cooldown
    at character creation, allowing the player to immediately use their full spell
    repertoire. This initialization is crucial for maintaining accurate spell timing
    and preventing issues with ability usage during combat.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ArcaneMageRefactored mage;

      mage.InitializeCooldowns();

      // Cooldowns are now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during character initialization. Repeated
    calls may cause unexpected behavior or duplicate cooldown entries. The method
    internally manages the cooldown database and does not require external parameters.
  warnings: Do not call this method during active combat as it may interfere with
    existing cooldown tracking. Ensure all spell data is loaded before calling this
    method to avoid missing cooldown entries.
