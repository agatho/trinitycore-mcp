  brief: Checks whether the quest has a specific objective type.
  description: This method determines if a given quest contains a particular type
    of objective, such as killing monsters, collecting items, or completing objectives.
    It is used to verify the presence of specific quest objectives within the quest's
    structure. The method returns true if the specified objective type exists in the
    quest, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for quest validation and
    handling different types of quest objectives in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []

    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Kill Objective
    code: "if (quest->HasQuestObjectiveType(QUEST_OBJECTIVE_TYPE_KILL)) {\n    //\
      \ Quest has kill objectives\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest processing and validation. It
    may be called multiple times per quest depending on the objective types present.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not validate the actual completion of objectives,
    only their presence in the quest structure.
