  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: SetConfig
  signature: void BotSpawnerOptimized::SetConfig(const Config & config)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes or updates the configuration settings for the bot spawner optimization
    module.
  description: The SetConfig method is responsible for applying a new configuration
    to the BotSpawnerOptimized class. This method allows dynamic adjustment of various
    parameters that control how bots are spawned and managed within the game environment.
    It typically expects a Config object containing key-value pairs that define behavior
    such as spawn rates, bot limits, and optimization thresholds. The configuration
    may influence performance characteristics and gameplay balance. This method is
    usually called during initialization or when runtime adjustments are required
    to adapt to changing server conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: A constant reference to a Config object containing the new settings
      for the bot spawner. This object should include all necessary parameters required
      by the BotSpawnerOptimized class, such as spawn intervals, maximum bot counts,
      and optimization flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Update
    code: 'Config newConfig;

      newConfig.Set("bot_spawn_interval", 30);

      newConfig.Set("max_bots", 50);

      spawner.SetConfig(newConfig);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Optimization Parameters
    code: 'Config optConfig;

      optConfig.Set("enable_optimization", true);

      optConfig.Set("cpu_threshold", 80);

      spawner.SetConfig(optConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger internal recalculations or reinitializations depending
    on which configuration values are changed. It's recommended to call this method
    before starting bot spawning operations to ensure consistent behavior.
  warnings: Modifying the configuration while bots are actively spawning might lead
    to inconsistent behavior or temporary performance degradation until the new settings
    take full effect.
