  brief: Fills a loot item data packet with information from this loot roll.
  description: The FillPacket method populates a WorldPackets::Loot::LootItemData
    structure with relevant data from the current LootRoll instance. This method is
    typically used when sending loot roll information to players in the game world,
    ensuring that the client receives all necessary details about a specific item
    being rolled for. The method does not perform any validation or error checking
    on its own; it assumes the provided packet object is properly initialized and
    ready to receive data. It directly accesses internal member variables of the LootRoll
    object to construct the packet contents.
