  signature: void Player::UpdateAverageItemLevelTotal()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's average item level total calculation based on equipped
    items.
  description: The UpdateAverageItemLevelTotal method recalculates and updates the
    player's overall average item level by analyzing all currently equipped items.
    This value is used in various game systems such as loot distribution, character
    progression tracking, and PvP rating calculations. The method iterates through
    the player's inventory slots, computes the weighted average of item levels from
    equipped items, and stores the result for later use. It typically gets invoked
    automatically when items are equipped, unequipped, or when item properties change
    during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateAverageItemLevelTotal();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Equipment Change
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      // Assume player just equipped a new weapon

      player->UpdateAverageItemLevelTotal();

      // Average item level is now updated to reflect the new equipment'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the game engine when equipment
    changes occur. Developers should not typically need to call this manually unless
    implementing custom gear evaluation systems or debugging item level calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently in a loop or without proper context may
    cause performance degradation. It's recommended to only invoke it when necessary,
    such as after significant equipment modifications.
