documentation:
  brief: Automatically equips the best available gear for the specified player based
    on their level and class.
  description: 'The AutoEquipBestGear method evaluates the player''s current inventory,
    available items in the game world, and their character class to determine and
    equip the highest-value gear that is appropriate for their level. This function
    typically considers item stats such as damage, armor, and enchantments, and will
    unequip existing items if better ones are found. It ensures that the player''s
    equipment is optimized without requiring manual selection. The method operates
    on a single player identified by the provided pointer and updates their inventory
    accordingly. Precondition: The player must be valid and online within the game
    world.'
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) in the game world. Must point to a valid online player.

    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nEquipmentManager* equipMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayerByGUID(playerId);\n\

  notes: This method may trigger a re-evaluation of the player's stats and appearance
    updates. It is recommended to call this function during idle periods or after
    significant gameplay events like level-ups or quest completions to avoid performance
    hiccups.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur. Also, calling this method too frequently can cause
    excessive inventory updates which might impact server performance.
