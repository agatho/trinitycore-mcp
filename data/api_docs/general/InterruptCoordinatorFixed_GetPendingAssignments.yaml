  method: GetPendingAssignments
  signature: int InterruptCoordinatorFixed::GetPendingAssignments() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of pending interrupt assignments in the coordinator.
  description: The GetPendingAssignments method returns the number of interrupt assignments
    that are currently pending execution within the InterruptCoordinatorFixed instance.
    This value represents how many interrupts have been scheduled but not yet processed
    or dispatched to their target entities. The method is typically used for monitoring
    and debugging purposes to understand the current load or state of the interrupt
    handling system. It provides a snapshot of pending work without modifying any
    internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of pending interrupt assignments.
    A return value of zero indicates no pending assignments, while a positive value
    indicates the count of assignments awaiting processing.
  examples:
  - title: Check Pending Interrupts
    code: "InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;\nint pendingCount = coordinator.GetPendingAssignments();\n\
      if (pendingCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"There are \" << pendingCount <<\
      \ \" pending interrupt assignments.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only operation and does not modify any internal
    state of the InterruptCoordinatorFixed instance. It is safe to call from multiple
    threads concurrently, assuming thread-safe access to the coordinator itself. The
    returned value reflects the state at the moment of the call and may change immediately
    after.
