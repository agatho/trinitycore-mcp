documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the error message from the BotAI initialization process
  description: The GetError method returns a human-readable string describing any
    error that occurred during the initialization of a bot's AI system. This method
    is typically called after attempting to initialize a bot's AI behavior to check
    for failures or misconfigurations. The returned string may contain details about
    missing dependencies, invalid configuration settings, or other initialization
    issues that prevented the bot from being properly set up. In a successful initialization
    scenario, this method would return an empty string or a status message indicating
    success.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the error message if initialization failed, or
    an empty string if no error occurred. The string may be localized and contains
    human-readable information about what went wrong during bot AI initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Check for initialization errors
    code: "BotAIInitializer initializer;\n// ... perform initialization ...\nstd::string\
      \ error = initializer.GetError();\nif (!error.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"\
      Bot AI initialization failed: \" << error << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Bot AI initialized successfully\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after attempting to initialize the bot
    AI system. The returned string is meant for debugging and logging purposes, not
    for programmatic error handling. The implementation may cache the error message
    internally and return it consistently until a new initialization attempt occurs.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-empty return value always indicates a fatal error
    - some implementations might return informational messages rather than actual
    errors. Always check the context of when this method is called to properly interpret
    the returned string.
