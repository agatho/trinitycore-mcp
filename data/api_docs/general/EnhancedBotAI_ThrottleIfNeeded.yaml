  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::ThrottleIfNeeded()
documentation:
  brief: Throttles bot AI behavior to prevent excessive resource consumption or game
    performance issues.
  description: The ThrottleIfNeeded method is responsible for managing the execution
    frequency of enhanced bot AI operations to avoid overloading the server or causing
    performance degradation. It evaluates current system load, bot activity levels,
    and configured throttling thresholds to determine whether AI processing should
    be limited. This method typically checks if certain conditions are met (such as
    high CPU usage or too many active bots) and applies appropriate delays or skips
    to reduce strain on the TrinityCore server. The throttling mechanism helps maintain
    stable gameplay experiences for both players and bots by ensuring that bot AI
    does not monopolize system resources.

    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::Update()\n{\n    ThrottleIfNeeded();\n    // Other\
      \ bot AI logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's update cycle to dynamically
    adjust processing intensity based on server load. It may internally use timers
    or counters to track execution frequency and apply delays when necessary.
