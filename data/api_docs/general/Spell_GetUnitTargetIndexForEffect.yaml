  class: Spell
  method: GetUnitTargetIndexForEffect
  signature: int32 Spell::GetUnitTargetIndexForEffect(const int & target, int effect)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target index for a specified effect in a spell.
  description: This method returns the unit target index for a given effect within
    a spell, allowing developers to determine which target the spell is targeting.
    It is commonly used in spell handling and targeting logic within TrinityCore's
    core. The method provides access to specific target information for each effect
    of a spell, making it useful for implementing custom spell behavior or analyzing
    spell targets.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The target index to retrieve, typically representing the target position
      in the spell's target list.
  - name: effect
    description: The effect index for which to retrieve the target, usually corresponding
      to a specific effect within the spell's effects array.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the unit target index for the specified
    effect. If no valid target is found, it returns -1, indicating that no target
    exists for the given effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Spell* spell = new Spell();\nint32 targetIndex = spell->GetUnitTargetIndexForEffect(target,\
      \ effect);\nif (targetIndex >= 0)\n{\n    // Valid target found\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // No valid target found for this effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Spell class and should be used within the context
    of spell handling logic. It requires proper initialization of spell objects and
    may not be available in all contexts depending on how the spell is constructed.
  warnings: The method may return -1 if no valid target exists for the specified effect,
    which could lead to incorrect assumptions about spell targeting behavior. Care
    should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other spell-related
    functions.
