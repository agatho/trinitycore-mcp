  method: ShouldUseBestialWrath
  signature: bool BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::ShouldUseBestialWrath(int * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether Bestial Wrath should be used based on current combat state
    and target conditions.
  description: This method evaluates the hunter's current situation to decide if using
    the Bestial Wrath ability would be beneficial. It considers factors such as the
    hunter's current rage, available targets, and the presence of specific debuffs
    or effects that make Bestial Wrath more effective. The method is typically called
    during AI decision-making processes to determine optimal spell usage in combat
    scenarios. This function does not directly cast the spell but returns a boolean
    indicating whether casting Bestial Wrath would be advantageous given the current
    game state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Bestial Wrath should be used according to the AI logic,
    false otherwise. The decision is based on evaluating combat conditions such as
    available rage, target threat level, and buff/debuff states that enhance the effectiveness
    of Bestial Wrath.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision loop
    code: "if (hunter->ShouldUseBestialWrath()) {\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, BESTIAL_WRATH_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state evaluation
    code: "bool useBestialWrath = hunter->ShouldUseBestialWrath();\nif (useBestialWrath\
      \ && hunter->GetPower(POWER_RAGE) >= 30) {\n    // Bestial Wrath is both recommended\
      \ and affordable\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, BESTIAL_WRATH_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during combat to ensure optimal spell
    timing. The decision logic may vary depending on the specific implementation of
    the Beast Mastery hunter AI and could be influenced by additional factors such
    as pet behavior, cooldowns, or encounter-specific mechanics.
  warnings: The method assumes that the hunter has a valid target and that the AI
    context is properly initialized. Calling this method without proper setup might
    lead to incorrect decisions or unexpected behavior in combat scenarios.
