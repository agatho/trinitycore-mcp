  method: FormationSlot
  signature: void FormationSlot::FormationSlot(uint32 guid, const int & pos, float
    maxDist, bool flexible, const std::string & role)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new FormationSlot with specified GUID, position, maximum distance,
    flexibility, and role.
  description: The FormationSlot constructor initializes a formation slot within the
    World of Warcraft TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the internal state
    of a formation slot by assigning it a unique identifier (GUID), defining its position
    in the formation, establishing a maximum distance threshold for positioning, determining
    whether the slot is flexible (allowing for movement), and assigning a role that
    defines its function within the group. Formation slots are used primarily in creature
    AI systems to manage how NPCs position themselves relative to each other during
    group combat or movement. The parameters define the behavioral constraints and
    spatial relationships of the slot within a formation.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the creature or unit that will occupy
      this formation slot
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the position index within the
      formation (negative values may indicate special positioning)
  - name: maxDist
    description: Maximum distance in yards from the formation center that this unit
      can move while maintaining formation
  - name: flexible
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this slot allows for flexible positioning
      (true) or fixed positioning (false)
  - name: role
    description: String identifier defining the role of this formation slot (e.g.,
      'leader', 'tank', 'healer', 'dps')
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Slot Initialization
    code: FormationSlot slot(12345, 0, 10.0f, true, "tank");
    language: cpp
  - title: Flexible Positioning with Role Assignment
    code: 'int position = -1;

      FormationSlot slot(67890, position, 15.0f, false, "healer");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the formation system when
    creating new formation slots for creatures. The 'pos' parameter can be negative
    to indicate special positioning roles such as leader or support units. The maxDist
    parameter affects how far a unit will stray from its designated position during
    combat movement.
