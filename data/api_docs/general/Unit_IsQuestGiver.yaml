documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is a quest giver.
  description: The IsQuestGiver method checks if the current Unit object is capable
    of providing quests to players. This method is commonly used in game logic to
    identify NPC quest givers, ensuring that the unit can properly interact with player
    quest systems. It returns true when the unit has quest-related functionality enabled,
    such as being an NPC or creature that offers quests, and false otherwise. The
    method is particularly useful for determining if a unit can be interacted with
    in terms of questing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is a quest giver, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the unit has the capability to provide quests to players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsQuestGiver()) {\n    // Perform quest-related actions\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsQuestGiver() && unit->GetNPCFlags() == NPC_FLAG_QUESTGIVER)\
      \ {\n    // Handle quest giver logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks the unit's flags or type to determine if it
    can provide quests. It is often used in conjunction with other methods like GetNPCFlags()
    or IsCreature() to validate quest giver functionality.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may not always accurately reflect whether a
    unit actually offers quests, as some units might be flagged as quest givers even
    if they do not provide any quests. Always verify with additional checks for accurate
    quest giver behavior.
