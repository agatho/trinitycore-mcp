documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the database locale index associated with the current CLI session.
  description: The GetSessionDbLocaleIndex method returns the LocaleConstant value
    representing the database locale index for the active CLI session. This index
    determines how localized content, such as quest text, item names, and NPC dialogues,
    are retrieved from the database. The method is typically used in command-line
    interface operations where localization settings need to be considered for proper
    data retrieval or display. It relies on the session's current locale configuration
    and does not perform any dynamic lookup or modification of locale settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LocaleConstant enum value indicating the database locale index for the
    current session. Possible values include LOCALE_en, LOCALE_ko, LOCALE_fr, LOCALE_de,
    LOCALE_zh, LOCALE_tw, LOCALE_es, LOCALE_ru, and others depending on the client
    and server localization support.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Print Current Session Locale
    code: 'LocaleConstant locale = handler->GetSessionDbLocaleIndex();

      std::cout << "Current session locale index: " << locale << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is read-only and does not modify any internal state. It should
    only be called when a valid CLI session exists. The returned LocaleConstant value
    corresponds to the database's supported locales, which may differ from client-side
    locale settings.
