  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::UpdateThroughputMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates throughput metrics for bot performance monitoring.
  description: The UpdateThroughputMetrics method collects and calculates performance
    statistics related to bot processing throughput. This includes tracking the number
    of operations completed per second, average execution times, and resource utilization.
    The method is typically invoked periodically to maintain up-to-date performance
    data for monitoring and optimization purposes within the TrinityCore framework.
    It helps identify bottlenecks in bot behavior and ensures efficient resource management
    across the game server.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.UpdateThroughputMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to maintain accurate performance metrics.
    It may involve CPU and memory overhead during execution, especially when processing
    large numbers of bots or complex operations.
