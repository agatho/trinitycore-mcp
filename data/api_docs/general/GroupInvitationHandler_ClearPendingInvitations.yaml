  class: GroupInvitationHandler

  signature: void GroupInvitationHandler::ClearPendingInvitations()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all pending group invitations from the handler's internal storage.
  description: The ClearPendingInvitations method removes all pending group invitations
    that have been stored within the GroupInvitationHandler instance. This typically
    occurs when a player leaves a group or when the system needs to reset invitation
    states. The method ensures that no stale or obsolete invitations remain in memory,
    preventing potential issues with duplicate invitations or incorrect group membership
    states. It is commonly invoked during player logout, group disbanding, or when
    cleaning up invitation state after failed attempts.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear all pending invitations for a player
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      // Assume some invitations are pending

      handler.ClearPendingInvitations(); // All pending invitations are now cleared'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    group management operations. It may be invoked automatically when a player's session
    ends or when a group is disbanded to prevent memory leaks and maintain clean invitation
    state.
