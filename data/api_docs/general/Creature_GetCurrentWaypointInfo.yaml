  method: GetCurrentWaypointInfo
  signature: std::pair<uint32, uint32> Creature::GetCurrentWaypointInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current waypoint ID and path ID for the creature.
  description: This method retrieves the current waypoint ID and path ID that the
    creature is following. It provides information about which specific waypoint within
    a path the creature is currently at, allowing developers to track the creature's
    movement along a predefined path. The returned pair represents the waypoint ID
    and path ID respectively, where the waypoint ID indicates the index of the current
    waypoint in the path, and the path ID identifies the unique path being followed
    by the creature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::pair<uint32, uint32> containing the current waypoint ID as the first
    element and the path ID as the second element. The pair represents the current
    waypoint within a path, with the first value indicating the waypoint index and
    the second value representing the unique path identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      std::pair<uint32, uint32> waypointInfo = creature->GetCurrentWaypointInfo();

      uint32 currentWaypointID = waypointInfo.first;

      uint32 currentPathID = waypointInfo.second;

      // Use the information to determine where the creature is in its path'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during movement updates or when tracking creature
    behavior. The returned values are usually valid only during active movement, and
    may change as the creature progresses through its path. Implementation details
    include that this method likely retrieves data from internal path tracking structures.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    movement-related methods, as it may not always reflect the most up-to-date state
    if the creature is actively moving. Also, if the creature has no path assigned,
    the returned values might be invalid or zero.
