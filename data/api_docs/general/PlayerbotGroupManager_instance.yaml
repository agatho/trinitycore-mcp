  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the PlayerbotGroupManager
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the PlayerbotGroupManager
    class, providing global access to a single instance of the group manager. This
    manager handles player bot groups, their assignments, and coordination within
    the TrinityCore framework. The method ensures that only one instance of PlayerbotGroupManager
    exists throughout the application lifecycle, making it thread-safe for concurrent
    access by multiple bot threads or systems. It is commonly used to retrieve the
    central group management object for operations such as adding/removing bots from
    groups, checking group status, or managing group behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of PlayerbotGroupManager. Returns nullptr
    if the instance has not been initialized yet, though this should typically not
    occur in normal operation since the singleton is usually constructed at application
    startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the PlayerbotGroupManager instance
    code: "PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = PlayerbotGroupManager::instance();\n\
      if (groupMgr)\n{\n    // Use the group manager to perform operations\n    groupMgr->AddBotToGroup(bot,\
      \ groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if a bot is in a group
    code: "PlayerbotGroupManager* mgr = PlayerbotGroupManager::instance();\nif (mgr\
      \ && mgr->IsInGroup(bot))\n{\n    // Bot is part of a player bot group\n   \
      \ Group* group = mgr->GetGroupByLeader(bot);\n    // Perform group-related operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the singleton design pattern, which means that all calls
    to instance() will return the same object reference. The implementation is expected
    to be thread-safe for read operations, though write operations should be synchronized
    if multiple threads are modifying group state concurrently. The singleton instance
    is typically initialized during server startup or when the first bot is created.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, avoid creating multiple instances manually
    as it may lead to unexpected behavior or memory leaks. Be cautious about calling
    this method before the manager has been properly initialized, though in practice
    this should not happen in standard TrinityCore operation.
