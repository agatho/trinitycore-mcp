  class: Item
  method: AddToObjectUpdate
  signature: bool Item::AddToObjectUpdate()
documentation:
  brief: Adds the item to the object update list for synchronization with clients.
  description: This method adds the Item object to the object update list, which is
    used by the TrinityCore server to synchronize the item's state with connected
    clients. The method ensures that the item will be included in the next object
    update cycle, allowing clients to receive updates about the item's properties
    such as stack count, durability, and other attributes. This is essential for maintaining
    proper game state synchronization and is typically called during item initialization
    or when changes occur that require client updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully added to the update list, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the item is already in the
    update list or that the object update system is not properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = new Item;\nbool success = item->AddToObjectUpdate();\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Item successfully added to update list\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during item initialization or when item properties
    change. It's important to note that the item must be in a valid state before calling
    this method, and it should not be called on items that are already being updated.
    Performance considerations include the overhead of adding items to update lists,
    especially in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method on an item that is already in the update list can
    lead to duplicate entries or synchronization issues. Care should be taken when
    calling this method during item lifecycle events to avoid potential memory corruption
    or client-side synchronization problems.
