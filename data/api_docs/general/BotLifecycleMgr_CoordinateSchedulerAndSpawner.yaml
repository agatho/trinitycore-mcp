  brief: Coordinates bot scheduling and spawner logic for managing AI-controlled player
    characters in the game world.
  description: The CoordinateSchedulerAndSpawner method manages the synchronization
    between bot lifecycle scheduling and the spawner system within TrinityCore's AI
    framework. This method ensures that bot instances are properly created, maintained,
    and destroyed according to configured schedules and spawn rules. It handles the
    coordination of various bot management components including spawn timers, cleanup
    routines, and state transitions for AI-controlled player characters. The method
    typically runs as part of the core game loop or periodic update cycle to maintain
    consistent bot behavior and resource utilization.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n    sBotLifecycleMgr->CoordinateSchedulerAndSpawner();\n\
      \    // ... more updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game update loop or dedicated
    AI tick routines. It may perform operations that could impact performance if bot
    counts are high, so it's recommended to monitor execution time in production environments.
