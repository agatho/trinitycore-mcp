  brief: Plays a sound effect associated with the spell
  description: The EffectPlaySound method is used to play a specific sound associated
    with a spell. This method typically triggers audio events that are defined in
    the spell's effect data, allowing for sound-based feedback during spell execution.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with other spell effects to provide auditory
    cues for player actions or game events. The method does not return any value and
    operates as part of the spell's execution sequence.

      \ associated with spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of a spell's effect execution and
    may be used in conjunction with other audio-related methods. It should be invoked
    only when the spell effect requires sound playback, and its usage depends on the
    specific spell being executed.
