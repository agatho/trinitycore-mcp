  class: QuestStrategy
  method: UpdateBehavior
  signature: void QuestStrategy::UpdateBehavior(BotAI * ai, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest behavior for a bot AI instance based on elapsed time and
    current quest state.
  description: The UpdateBehavior method is responsible for managing and updating
    the quest-related actions of a bot AI character. It processes the bot's current
    quest objectives, evaluates progress, and adjusts behavior accordingly. This method
    is typically called periodically by the game loop to ensure that bots maintain
    appropriate quest-related activities such as accepting quests, turning in quests,
    or following quest givers. The method uses the provided BotAI instance and time
    difference (diff) to determine what actions should be taken next in the bot's
    quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that represents the bot whose quest
      behavior is being updated. This parameter must not be null.
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. Used
      to determine timing of quest-related actions and state transitions.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI updates...\n    questStrategy.UpdateBehavior(this,\
      \ diff);\n    // Other AI updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating behavior with custom time handling
    code: "void QuestStrategy::UpdateBehavior(BotAI* ai, uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!ai)\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Process quest logic based on time delta\n   \
      \ if (diff > 1000) // Only process if sufficient time has passed\n    {\n  \
      \      // Update quest behavior here\n        ai->DoQuestUpdate();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update cycle and should be called regularly
    to maintain proper quest progression. The implementation likely involves checking
    quest states, evaluating objectives, and potentially triggering quest-related
    actions like movement or interaction with NPCs. Performance considerations include
    avoiding heavy computations within this method as it may be called frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior. The diff parameter
    should represent actual elapsed time to ensure correct timing of quest-related
    actions.
