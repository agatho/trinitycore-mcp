  signature: void CriteriaHandler::SendCriteriaProgressRemoved(uint32 criteriaId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to remove criteria progress for the specified criteria ID
    from the player's client.
  description: The SendCriteriaProgressRemoved method is responsible for notifying
    the player's client that a specific criterion progress has been removed. This
    typically occurs when a criteria associated with an achievement is no longer tracked,
    such as when a quest is abandoned or a condition is reset. The method sends a
    packet through the network layer to update the client-side UI, ensuring that the
    criteria entry is removed from the player's achievement progress display. It operates
    within the context of World of Warcraft's achievement and criteria system, where
    criteria represent individual requirements needed to complete achievements.
  parameters:
  - name: criteriaId
    description: The unique identifier of the criteria whose progress should be removed.
      This ID corresponds to a specific criterion defined in the game's database or
      achievement system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Criteria Progress for a Specific Criterion
    code: 'CriteriaHandler handler;

      handler.SendCriteriaProgressRemoved(12345); // Removes progress for criteria
      with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server when criteria are
    reset or removed due to game state changes, such as quest abandonment or achievement
    resets. It's important to ensure that the criteriaId passed is valid and corresponds
    to an existing criterion in the database.
