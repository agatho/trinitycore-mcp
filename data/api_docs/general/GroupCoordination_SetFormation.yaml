  class: GroupCoordination
  method: SetFormation
  signature: void GroupCoordination::SetFormation(const int & formation)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the formation type for the group coordination.
  description: The SetFormation method configures the tactical formation that a group
    of players or NPCs should adopt during coordinated actions. This method is typically
    used in group-based scenarios such as raid encounters, battlegrounds, or scripted
    events where positioning is critical. The formation parameter defines how members
    of the group should align themselves relative to each other or a designated leader.
    This method does not validate the formation type internally and assumes that the
    provided value corresponds to a valid formation ID defined within the game's configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: formation
    description: An integer identifier representing the desired formation type. Valid
      values are typically predefined constants or IDs that correspond to specific
      tactical formations such as line, circle, or column. The exact meaning of each
      value depends on the implementation and game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Line Formation
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coord = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordination();

      coord->SetFormation(1); // Assumes 1 represents a line formation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Formation Constant
    code: '#define FORMATION_LINE 2

      ...

      GroupCoordination* coord = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordination();

      coord->SetFormation(FORMATION_LINE); // Sets group to line formation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the group coordination system and may be used in conjunction
    with other methods like GetFormation() or UpdateFormation(). It is important to
    ensure that the formation ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid formation
    defined in the game's data files or configuration. The actual visual representation
    of formations may depend on client-side rendering and server-side logic.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or undefined formation ID may result in unexpected
    behavior or no effect on group positioning. Always validate formation IDs against
    known constants or lookup tables before calling this method to avoid runtime errors
    or unintended tactical setups.
