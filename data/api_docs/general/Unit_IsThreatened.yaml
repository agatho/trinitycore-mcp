  method: IsThreatened
  signature: bool Unit::IsThreatened() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit has active threat from any source.
  description: The IsThreatened method checks if a Unit object has received threat
    from any source, meaning it has been targeted by enemies or has active threat
    in the game mechanics sense. This method is commonly used in AI logic to determine
    if a unit should engage in combat or avoid certain behaviors based on its threat
    status. The method returns true when the unit has threat, false otherwise, and
    is typically used in conjunction with other threat-related methods to manage NPC
    behavior and combat decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has active threat from any source, false otherwise.
    A unit with threat means it has been targeted by enemies or has received threat
    from a hostile entity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Check
    code: "if (unit->IsThreatened())\n{\n    // Unit is under attack\n    // Perform\
      \ defensive actions\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Unit is not threatened\n    // Continue\
      \ with normal behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other threat-related methods
    like IsInThreatList() or GetThreatManager(). It's important to note that this
    method does not necessarily mean the unit is actively engaged in combat, but rather
    that it has received threat from enemies. Performance considerations include checking
    for threat before performing expensive operations.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in AI logic as it can lead to incorrect
    behavior if not properly understood. The method may return false even when a unit
    has been targeted by enemies but is not actively engaged in combat, so developers
    should consider the context of use.
