  signature: int CombatSpecializationBase::GetNearbyEnemies(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts and returns the number of nearby enemy units within the specified
    range.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemies method calculates and returns the total count
    of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within a given radius around the
    combat specialization's target. This method is typically used in AI logic to determine
    enemy proximity for decision-making, such as choosing appropriate abilities or
    movement patterns. The range parameter defines the maximum distance at which enemies
    are considered 'nearby'. This method does not distinguish between different types
    of enemies (e.g., players vs. creatures) and simply counts all hostile units within
    range. It's commonly used in spell or ability targeting logic where proximity
    matters for gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of enemy units found within
    the specified range. A return value of 0 indicates no enemies are present within
    range, while positive values indicate the count of nearby enemies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Enemy Proximity
    code: "int enemyCount = combatSpec->GetNearbyEnemies(10.0f);\nif (enemyCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Execute ability that targets multiple enemies\n    DoAOEAttack();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Enemy Count for Conditional Logic
    code: "float range = 8.0f;\nint nearbyEnemies = combatSpec->GetNearbyEnemies(range);\n\
      \nif (nearbyEnemies >= 3)\n{\n    // Use area-of-effect ability\n    UseSpell(SpellId::Blizzard);\n\
      }\nelse if (nearbyEnemies == 1)\n{\n    // Use single-target ability\n    UseSpell(SpellId::Fireball);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial query to locate nearby units, which may have
    performance implications in high-density combat scenarios. The range parameter
    is typically measured in yards or game units, and the actual distance calculation
    uses the unit's collision radius for accurate detection. The method assumes that
    the CombatSpecializationBase instance has a valid target set, as it calculates
    proximity relative to that target.
  warnings: This method may return inaccurate results if the combat specialization's
    target is not properly initialized or if units are in invalid positions. Avoid
    calling this method frequently in tight loops without caching results, as it could
    impact performance during intense combat situations.
