documentation:
  brief: Handles null effect implementation for spell calculations
  description: This method represents a placeholder or null effect handler in the
    Spell class that is typically used when a spell effect does not require specific
    processing. It serves as a default implementation for effects that are either
    not implemented or are intentionally left blank during spell execution. The method
    does not perform any action and is often called during spell processing when no
    specific effect handling is needed, particularly in cases where the effect type
    is not properly defined or handled.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Effect Usage
    code: "void Spell::EffectNULL() {\n    // No action performed\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used as a fallback when no specific effect handler
    exists for a given spell. It may be called during spell processing to ensure proper
    handling of undefined effects, particularly in cases where effects are not fully
    implemented or require special handling.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with actual effect implementations;
    it serves purely as a placeholder and does not perform any meaningful operations.
