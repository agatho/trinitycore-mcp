  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: CheckForKiteNeed
  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::CheckForKiteNeed() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit should initiate a kite strategy during combat based
    on distance and threat metrics.
  description: The CheckForKiteNeed method evaluates the current combat state of a
    unit to decide if it should begin or continue using a kite tactic. This involves
    analyzing factors such as the distance between the unit and its target, the unit's
    threat level, and the target's attack speed or ability usage patterns. The method
    is typically used by AI-controlled units to dynamically adjust their behavior
    during combat encounters. It returns true when the conditions indicate that kiting
    would be beneficial for survival or damage output, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit should initiate or continue a kite strategy in
    combat; returns false if kiting is not advisable based on current combat metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (analyzer.CheckForKiteNeed()) {\n    unit->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \    // Initiate kiting behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CombatStateAnalyzer class and relies on internal
    state tracking of threat, distance, and target behavior. It should be called regularly
    during combat updates to ensure dynamic response to changing conditions.
  warnings: The method assumes that all relevant combat state data has been properly
    initialized before calling. Incorrect or outdated threat data may lead to inappropriate
    kite decisions.
