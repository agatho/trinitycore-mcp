documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is within a friendly area.
  description: This method checks if the player is currently located within an area
    that is considered friendly, typically defined by the game's faction system or
    zone mechanics. It evaluates the player's current position against the boundaries
    of friendly zones and returns true if the player is inside such an area, false
    otherwise. The method is commonly used in gameplay logic to determine whether
    a player can interact with NPCs or objects in certain zones without triggering
    hostile actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is within a friendly area, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the player's current location is within a zone where friendly
    interactions are allowed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsInFriendlyArea()) {\n    // Player is in a friendly zone\n\
      \    // Proceed with friendly NPC interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details may depend on the specific zone or faction boundaries
    defined by TrinityCore's core logic. The method likely uses internal zone data
    or faction checks to determine whether the player is in a friendly area.
  warnings: This method does not account for dynamic faction changes or temporary
    zone restrictions; it only evaluates static zone boundaries.
