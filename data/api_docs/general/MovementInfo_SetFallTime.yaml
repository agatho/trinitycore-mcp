  class: MovementInfo
  method: SetFallTime
  signature: void MovementInfo::SetFallTime(uint32 fallTime)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the fall time for movement information, typically used during player
    or creature falling animations.
  description: The SetFallTime method assigns a fall duration value to the MovementInfo
    object. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to synchronize
    falling physics and animations between the client and server. The fall time represents
    how long a unit has been in a falling state, measured in milliseconds. This value
    affects how the client interpolates the falling movement and determines when the
    unit should land. Setting this value correctly ensures realistic movement behavior
    during jumps, falls, or other gravity-based actions.
  parameters:
  - name: fallTime
    description: The fall duration in milliseconds. This value represents how long
      the unit has been falling and is used to calculate interpolation for falling
      animations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Fall Time for a Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      MovementInfo& moveInfo = player->GetMovementInfo();

      moveInfo.SetFallTime(1500); // Set fall time to 1.5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Fall Time During a Jump Event
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      MovementInfo& moveInfo = creature->GetMovementInfo();

      uint32 jumpDuration = 800; // 800ms fall time

      moveInfo.SetFallTime(jumpDuration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the movement system when a
    unit begins or continues falling. The fall time value should be consistent with
    the actual physics calculations to maintain synchronization between server and
    client. It's important to note that this value is reset when the unit lands or
    changes movement states.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting fall times can cause visual glitches in falling animations,
    such as units appearing to float or snap to ground unexpectedly. This method should
    not be called directly during normal gameplay unless you're implementing custom
    movement logic or debugging physics issues.
