documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information identifier for the transport object
  description: The GetDebugInfo method retrieves a unique debug identifier associated
    with the transport instance. This identifier is typically used for debugging purposes
    within the TrinityCore framework to track and distinguish different transport
    objects during development and troubleshooting. The method provides a simple integer
    value that can be used in logs, debug output, or diagnostic tools to identify
    specific transport entities in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the debug identifier for this transport object.
    This value is typically generated at runtime and may correspond to internal object
    tracking mechanisms within the TrinityCore server.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: 'Transport* transport = ...; // Assume transport is initialized

      int debugInfo = transport->GetDebugInfo();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("transport", "Transport debug info: {}", debugInfo);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for internal debugging and development
    purposes. The returned value may not be meaningful outside of a debugging context
    and should not be relied upon for game logic or gameplay mechanics.
