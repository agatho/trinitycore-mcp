  method: IsGargoyleActive
  signature: bool UnholyPetTracker::IsGargoyleActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player's gargoyle pet is currently active.
  description: The IsGargoyleActive method determines if the player has an active
    gargoyle pet summoned as part of their unholy death knight specialization. This
    method is typically used in the context of the UnholyPetTracker class, which manages
    the state and behavior of unholy death knight pets. The gargoyle pet is a summoned
    creature that provides specific abilities and effects during combat. This check
    is essential for determining when certain abilities or mechanics should be applied
    or disabled based on the pet's active status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has an active gargoyle pet; otherwise, returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (unholyPetTracker.IsGargoyleActive()) {\n    // Apply gargoyle-specific\
      \ effects or logic\n    DoGargoyleEffects();\n} else {\n    // Fallback behavior\
      \ when no gargoyle is active\n    DoDefaultBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Ability Cooldown
    code: "if (unholyPetTracker.IsGargoyleActive() && player.HasSpellCooldown(SPELL_GARGOYLE_STRIKE))\
      \ {\n    // Prevent using ability if gargoyle is active and cooldown is not\
      \ ready\n    return false;\n}\nreturn true;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal pet tracking state within the UnholyPetTracker
    class. It may be called frequently during combat updates, so performance should
    be considered in high-frequency contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when the player is a death knight
    with unholy specialization, as behavior may be undefined for other classes or
    specs. The method does not validate if the pet is actually spawned in the world,
    just its active state in the tracker.
