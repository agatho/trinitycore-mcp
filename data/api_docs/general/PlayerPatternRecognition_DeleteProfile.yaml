  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: DeleteProfile
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::DeleteProfile(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Deletes a player pattern recognition profile associated with the specified
    GUID.
  description: The DeleteProfile method removes a player's pattern recognition data
    from the system based on the provided unique identifier (GUID). This functionality
    is typically used when a player character is deleted or when pattern recognition
    data needs to be cleared for administrative purposes. The method ensures that
    all related pattern recognition entries are removed from storage, freeing up resources
    and maintaining data integrity. It operates synchronously and may have performance
    implications if invoked frequently in rapid succession.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose pattern recognition
      profile is to be deleted. Must be a valid, non-zero GUID representing an existing
      player character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete a Player's Pattern Recognition Profile
    code: "PlayerPatternRecognition* patternRec = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayerPatternRecognition();\n\
      if (patternRec)\n{\n    patternRec->DeleteProfile(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GUID corresponds to an existing player in the
    database. It is recommended to verify the existence of the player before calling
    this method to avoid potential errors or undefined behavior. The deletion process
    may involve database operations and should be considered when handling large volumes
    of data.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or database inconsistencies. Ensure that all references to
    the deleted profile are properly cleaned up by the calling code to prevent dangling
    pointers or access violations.
