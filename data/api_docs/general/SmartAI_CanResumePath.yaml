  signature: bool SmartAI::CanResumePath()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the SmartAI instance can resume a previously interrupted path.
  description: The CanResumePath method determines whether the SmartAI object is capable
    of continuing a movement path that was previously paused or interrupted. This
    functionality is commonly used in AI behavior scripting to manage creature movement
    states, particularly when pathfinding is temporarily suspended due to environmental
    changes, combat engagement, or other game events. The method evaluates internal
    state flags and path data to make this determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the SmartAI can resume its path; otherwise returns false.
    This indicates whether the AI has valid path data and is in a state where movement
    continuation is possible.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check path resumption capability
    code: "if (creature->GetAI()->CanResumePath()) {\n    // Attempt to resume path\n\
      \    creature->GetAI()->ResumePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional path resumption in AI update loop
    code: "void SmartAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (!IsMoving() && CanResumePath())\
      \ {\n        ResumePath();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks internal flags such as whether the AI is currently
    paused, has valid path data, and is not in a state that would prevent path resumption.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with movement-related methods like PausePath()
    and ResumePath().
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if a path was previously interrupted
    may lead to unexpected behavior. Always ensure that the AI has actually paused
    or interrupted its path before attempting to resume it.
