  brief: Determines whether a player should be teleported to a spirit healer after
    death
  description: The ShouldUseSpiritHealer method evaluates the conditions under which
    a player should be directed to a spirit healer upon dying. This typically occurs
    when the player is in a location where resurrection is not immediately possible,
    such as in certain battlegrounds or areas with no nearby graveyard. The method
    considers factors like player location, game mode, and server configuration to
    make this determination. It returns true if the player should be teleported to
    the spirit healer, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player should be teleported to a spirit healer after
    death; false if normal resurrection mechanics should apply.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in death handling
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager->ShouldUseSpiritHealer())\n{\n    player->TeleportToSpiritHealer();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    player->ResurrectPlayer();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the death processing phase of a player's
    lifecycle. The decision logic may vary based on server settings and game rules,
    particularly in battleground scenarios where spirit healers are used as an alternative
    to normal resurrection points.
