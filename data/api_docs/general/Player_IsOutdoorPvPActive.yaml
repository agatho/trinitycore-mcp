  brief: Determines whether the player is currently in an Outdoor PVP area.
  description: The IsOutdoorPvPActive method checks if the player is located within
    an Outdoor PVP zone, which is a special area where players can engage in PvP combat
    without the usual PvP restrictions. This method returns true when the player's
    current zone or area is marked as an Outdoor PVP zone, allowing for specific gameplay
    mechanics such as PvP flagging and engagement with enemy players. The method is
    commonly used to determine if a player can participate in PvP activities or if
    they are in a zone where PvP rules apply.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in an Outdoor PVP area, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player's current location supports PvP combat without
    restrictions.

    code: "if (player->IsOutdoorPvPActive())\n{\n    // Player is in an Outdoor PVP\
      \ zone\n    // Can engage in PvP combat\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is not in\
      \ an Outdoor PVP zone\n    // Cannot engage in PvP combat\n}"

  notes: This method relies on the player's current zone information and may be affected
    by zone flags or game mechanics. It should be used in conjunction with other methods
    that check for specific PVP status or zone conditions.
  warnings: This method does not account for player state changes during gameplay,
    such as being flagged for PvP or entering a restricted area. Developers should
    consider using additional checks to determine full PvP eligibility.
