  class: GatheringManager
  method: RecordStatistics
  signature: void GatheringManager::RecordStatistics(const GatheringNode & node, bool
    success)
documentation:
  brief: Records gathering statistics for a specified node based on success or failure
    of the gathering action.
  description: The RecordStatistics method is responsible for logging and updating
    gathering-related statistics within the GatheringManager class. It takes a reference
    to a GatheringNode object and a boolean flag indicating whether the gathering
    attempt was successful. This method likely updates internal counters, logs events
    to the database, or triggers related game mechanics such as achievement progression
    or player feedback. The method serves as part of the core gathering system that
    tracks player interactions with resource nodes in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: node
    description: A constant reference to the GatheringNode object representing the
      resource node that was gathered from. This contains information about the node
      type, location, and other relevant properties.
  - name: success
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the gathering attempt succeeded
      (true) or failed (false). This determines how statistics are recorded and potentially
      affects game state or player rewards.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GatheringNode node;

      // Assume node is initialized with valid data

      bool success = true;

      gatheringManager.RecordStatistics(node, success);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Gathering Statistics Recording
    code: "if (player->CanGather(node)) {\n    bool gatherSuccess = player->GatherResource(node);\n\
      \    gatheringManager.RecordStatistics(node, gatherSuccess);\n} else {\n   \
      \ gatheringManager.RecordStatistics(node, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the gathering system after a player
    attempts to collect resources from a node. It may interact with database systems
    to persist statistics and could be used in conjunction with event handlers or
    achievement systems. The method should be thread-safe if multiple players can
    gather simultaneously from the same node.
  warnings: Ensure that the GatheringNode object passed is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method, as invalid nodes might cause unexpected behavior or
    errors during statistic recording. Avoid calling this method in performance-critical
    sections without considering potential database I/O overhead.
