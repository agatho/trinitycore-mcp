  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: SetSpellPriority
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::SetSpellPriority(uint32 spellId, InterruptPriority
    priority)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the interrupt priority level for a specified spell within the interrupt
    coordinator.
  description: The SetSpellPriority method configures the interrupt priority of a
    given spell ID, determining how that spell should be prioritized when multiple
    interrupts are possible. This is used in the context of spell interruption mechanics,
    particularly in systems where certain spells may override or be overridden by
    others based on defined priority levels. The method allows for dynamic adjustment
    of spell behavior during combat, enabling fine-grained control over which spells
    can interrupt others. It's typically invoked during spell initialization or configuration
    phases and affects how the game engine evaluates interrupt scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to set the interrupt
      priority. Must be a valid spell entry ID from the game's spell database.
  - name: priority
    description: The interrupt priority level to assign to the specified spell. Values
      are typically defined by an InterruptPriority enumeration, with higher values
      indicating higher priority for interruption.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a High Priority Interrupt Spell
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetSpellPriority(12345, INTERRUPT_PRIORITY_HIGH);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Multiple Spells with Different Priorities
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetSpellPriority(12345, INTERRUPT_PRIORITY_HIGH);

      coordinator->SetSpellPriority(12346, INTERRUPT_PRIORITY_MEDIUM);

      coordinator->SetSpellPriority(12347, INTERRUPT_PRIORITY_LOW);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal spell priority mappings within the
    interrupt coordinator. Changes made via this function will affect all future interrupt
    evaluations involving the specified spell IDs. The implementation likely uses
    a hash map or similar data structure for fast lookups during combat scenarios.
  warnings: Modifying spell priorities at runtime can lead to unexpected behavior
    if not properly synchronized with the game's combat state. Ensure that priority
    changes are made before any combat begins or during appropriate synchronization
    points to avoid inconsistent interrupt handling.
