  class: Creature
  method: ForcedDespawn
  signature: void Creature::ForcedDespawn(uint32 timeMSToDespawn, int forceRespawnTimer)
documentation:
  brief: Forces a creature to despawn after a specified time period.
  description: The ForcedDespawn method allows a creature to be removed from the world
    after a specific delay, with optional respawn timer. This method is commonly used
    in AI scripts or quest handling to manage creature behavior and ensure proper
    cleanup of game objects. The creature will be removed from the world after the
    specified time period, and optionally respawned based on the forceRespawnTimer
    parameter. This functionality is essential for managing dynamic creature spawns
    and preventing memory leaks in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: timeMSToDespawn
    description: The time in milliseconds after which the creature should be despawned.
      A value of 0 means immediate despawn.
  - name: forceRespawnTimer
    description: The respawn timer in milliseconds to force respawn the creature after
      despawn. If set to 0, no respawn will occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->ForcedDespawn(5000, 10000); // Despawn after 5 seconds, respawn after
      10 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Immediate Despawn Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->ForcedDespawn(0, 0); // Immediate despawn with no respawn'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can affect the game world's memory
    management. It is typically used in conjunction with AI scripts or quest handlers
    where creatures need to be removed from the world after a certain time period.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior or memory
    leaks if not handled properly. The respawn timer should be carefully managed to
    avoid creating infinite loops or unintended creature spawns.
