  method: GetSlotByItemGUID
  signature: int Bag::GetSlotByItemGUID(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the slot index of an item within the bag using its GUID.
  description: The GetSlotByItemGUID method searches through the bag's contents to
    find the slot index where an item with the specified GUID is located. This method
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore to determine the position of
    a specific item in a player's inventory or container. The method performs a linear
    search through the bag's item slots and returns the zero-based index if found,
    or -1 if no matching item is present. It is important to note that this method
    does not validate whether the GUID corresponds to a valid item in the context
    of the current session or world state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the slot index (0-based) where the item
    with the given GUID is located within the bag. Returns -1 if no item with the
    specified GUID exists in the bag.
  examples:
  - title: Find Item Slot by GUID
    code: "int slot = myBag->GetSlotByItemGUID(123456789);\nif (slot != -1) {\n  \
      \  // Item found at slot 'slot'\n    printf(\"Item found at slot %d\\n\", slot);\n\
      } else {\n    // Item not found in bag\n    printf(\"Item not found in bag\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through all slots in the bag, which
    may have performance implications for bags with many items. It assumes that the
    GUID is valid and corresponds to an item currently stored within this specific
    bag instance.
  warnings: The method does not validate if the provided GUID actually refers to an
    item in the current world state. If called on a bag that has been modified or
    cleared, it may return incorrect results. Additionally, the returned slot index
    should be validated against the bag's actual size before accessing items directly.
