    & data)
documentation:
  brief: Saves additional data for an instance script during a save event.
  description: The SetAdditionalData method is used to store supplementary information
    related to an instance script's state during a save operation. This method is
    typically invoked when persisting dynamic or runtime data that cannot be captured
    through standard instance saving mechanisms. It allows scripts to maintain custom
    state information that may be required for proper restoration of the instance's
    condition upon reload or server restart. The method accepts an UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent
    object which contains the data to be saved.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: An UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent object containing the additional
      data to be saved for the instance script.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Saving Boss Kill State
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnBossKill(uint32\
      \ bossId) override\n    {\n        UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent data;\n   \
      \     data.AddData(\"boss_killed\", bossId);\n        SetAdditionalData(data);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during instance save operations and should
    be used carefully to avoid performance bottlenecks. The data stored via this method
    is intended for persistence across server restarts or instance reloads.
