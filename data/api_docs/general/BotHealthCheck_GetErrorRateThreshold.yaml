  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: GetErrorRateThreshold
  signature: float BotHealthCheck::GetErrorRateThreshold() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the error rate threshold value used for health checks in bot behavior.
  description: The GetErrorRateThreshold method returns a floating-point value that
    represents the maximum allowable error rate for health-related checks within the
    bot's AI system. This threshold determines how much deviation from expected health
    metrics is acceptable before triggering corrective actions or alerts. The value
    is typically used in conjunction with other health monitoring mechanisms to ensure
    bots maintain appropriate health states during gameplay. This method does not
    modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the error rate threshold. Values are typically
    between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 means no tolerance for errors and 1.0 allows full
    deviation. Lower values indicate stricter health monitoring requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float threshold = botHealthCheck.GetErrorRateThreshold();

      printf("Current error rate threshold: %.2f\n", threshold);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Threshold in Conditional Logic
    code: "float threshold = botHealthCheck.GetErrorRateThreshold();\nif (currentErrorRate\
      \ > threshold) {\n    // Trigger health warning or corrective action\n    bot->HandleHealthWarning();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned value may vary depending on the specific bot configuration or difficulty
    settings. This threshold is often used in conjunction with other health metrics
    to determine overall bot health status.
