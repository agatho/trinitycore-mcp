documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the price ratio configuration value for a specified auction house
    type.
  description: The GetConfigPriceRatio method returns a uint32 value representing
    the configured price ratio used by the Auction Bot system for a given auction
    house type. This ratio is typically used to determine pricing strategies when
    listing items on auction houses, such as setting minimum bid prices or calculating
    listing fees. The method takes an AuctionHouseType parameter to specify which
    auction house configuration should be queried, allowing different behaviors for
    different auction house types (e.g., alliance vs. horde). The returned value is
    usually a percentage multiplier or scaling factor that influences how item prices
    are calculated within the bot's logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the configured price ratio for the specified
    auction house type. This value typically functions as a multiplier or percentage
    used in pricing calculations by the Auction Bot system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve price ratio for Alliance auction house
    code: 'uint32 ratio = auctionBotConfig->GetConfigPriceRatio(AUCTION_HOUSE_ALLIANCE);

      // Returns the configured price ratio for Alliance auction house

      std::cout << "Alliance Auction House Price Ratio: " << ratio << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a configuration system that allows different
    pricing behaviors across various auction house types. The implementation may involve
    internal lookups or cached values for performance reasons, and the returned value
    should be treated as a scaling factor rather than an absolute price.
  warnings: Ensure that the AuctionHouseType parameter passed to this method is valid,
    as invalid values might result in undefined behavior or incorrect pricing calculations.
    This method should only be called after the configuration system has been properly
    initialized.
