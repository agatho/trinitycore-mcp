  class: Quest
  method: GetQuestTag
  signature: int Quest::GetQuestTag() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the quest tag identifier for the current quest.
  description: The GetQuestTag method retrieves the unique quest tag identifier associated
    with a specific quest object. This tag is used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    to track and manage quest-related data, including quest completion status, quest
    objectives, and quest rewards. The method returns an integer value representing
    the quest tag, which is typically used for identifying specific quest instances
    within the game world. This functionality is essential for quest tracking and
    management in World of Warcraft's quest system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the quest tag identifier. This value corresponds
    to a unique identifier assigned to each quest instance, allowing developers to
    distinguish between different quests in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Tag Retrieval
    code: "int questTag = quest->GetQuestTag();\n// Use questTag for quest identification\n\
      if (questTag == 12345) {\n    // Handle specific quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Quest class and operates on const objects, meaning
    it does not modify the quest state. The returned value represents a unique identifier
    that may be used for internal game mechanics tracking but should not be confused
    with other identifiers like GUID or quest ID.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine quest completion status directly;
    developers should use GetQuestStatus() instead for determining if a quest is complete.
    Also, the returned value may be zero for quests that have not yet been assigned
    a tag.
