documentation:
  brief: Removes all specialization spells from the player's spell book.
  description: This method removes all spells associated with the player's current
    specialization from their spell book. It is typically used during class changes
    or specialization switching to ensure that no conflicting spells remain in the
    character's spell list. The method operates on the player's current active specialization
    and clears all related spell entries, effectively resetting the spellbook for
    that specific specialization. This action is crucial for maintaining proper gameplay
    balance and preventing spell conflicts during class transitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->RemoveSpecializationSpells();

      // Removes all specialization spells from the player''s spell book'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely iterates through the player''s
    spellbook and removes all spells that are associated with their current specialization.
    It may also update the spellbook cache to reflect these changes. Performance considerations:
    This operation is generally lightweight but can be costly if performed frequently
    during class transitions or specialization switches.'
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player's specialization is
    already changed or when transitioning between classes, as calling it at the wrong
    time may result in loss of important spells or incorrect spellbook state. It is
    recommended to use this method in conjunction with other methods that handle specialization
    changes to ensure proper synchronization.
