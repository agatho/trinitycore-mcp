  class: GenericMovementGenerator
  method: Deactivate
  signature: void GenericMovementGenerator::Deactivate(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the movement generator, stopping any active movement behavior
    for the associated unit.
  description: The Deactivate method is used to halt the execution of a movement generator,
    effectively pausing or canceling any ongoing movement behavior for the unit it
    is attached to. This method is typically called when a unit's movement needs to
    be interrupted or when transitioning between different movement states. It ensures
    that the movement generator no longer processes updates and releases any resources
    associated with active movement. The deactivation may occur during combat, pathfinding
    interruptions, or when a new movement behavior is assigned to the unit.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose movement generator is being deactivated.
      This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid unit in the game
      world.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Example
    code: 'Unit* target = ...; // Some unit with active movement

      GenericMovementGenerator* movementGen = ...; // Reference to movement generator

      movementGen->Deactivate(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivation in Combat Context
    code: "void OnCombatEnd(Unit* unit)\n{\n    if (unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == IDLE_MOTION_TYPE)\n    {\n        // Deactivate any active movement generator\n\
      \        unit->GetMotionMaster()->Deactivate();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement system in TrinityCore and works in conjunction
    with the MotionMaster class. It does not directly modify the unit's position but
    rather stops the movement generator from updating its state. The method should
    be called on the same thread that manages the unit's movement to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed to this method is valid and not destroyed
    before calling Deactivate. Calling this method with a null pointer will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, deactivating a movement generator
    while another is active may lead to inconsistent movement states if not handled
    properly.
