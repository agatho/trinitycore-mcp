  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: SimplifyPath
  signature: int FollowBehaviorUtils::SimplifyPath(const int & path)
documentation:
  brief: Simplifies a given path by removing redundant or invalid segments and returns
    the simplified path identifier.
  description: 'The SimplifyPath method processes a provided path identifier to remove
    any redundant, invalid, or unnecessary segments. It ensures that the resulting
    path is optimized for use within the TrinityCore AI system. This utility is particularly
    useful in behavior tree implementations where pathfinding logic needs to be streamlined
    for performance and clarity. The method operates on internal path data structures
    and modifies them in-place. Precondition: The input path must be a valid identifier
    registered with the AI system. Postcondition: Returns an optimized path identifier
    that can be used for navigation or movement.'
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the simplified path identifier. A return
    value of -1 indicates an error occurred during simplification, such as an invalid
    input path or internal processing failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int simplifiedPath = FollowBehaviorUtils::SimplifyPath(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "int result = FollowBehaviorUtils::SimplifyPath(-1);\nif (result == -1)\
      \ {\n    // Handle invalid path error\n    printf(\"Invalid path provided\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI path management system and should only be called
    on paths that have been previously initialized. The internal implementation may
    cache simplified results for performance optimization. Ensure that all path identifiers
    passed to this function are valid and registered with the AI subsystem.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered path identifier may
    result in undefined behavior or return -1. Always validate input paths before
    calling SimplifyPath. Do not assume that the returned path identifier is immediately
    usable for movement without additional validation steps.
