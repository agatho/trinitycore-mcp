  brief: Adds a specified amount of resource to the ResourceManager.
  description: The AddResource method is used to increment the quantity of a specific
    resource type within the ResourceManager. This method typically handles resource
    accumulation, such as adding gold, ore, herbs, or other in-game materials. It
    is commonly invoked during gameplay events like quest rewards, loot drops, or
    resource gathering activities. The method updates internal resource tracking and
    may trigger related callbacks or notifications depending on the implementation.

      to be added. Must be a non-negative integer.
