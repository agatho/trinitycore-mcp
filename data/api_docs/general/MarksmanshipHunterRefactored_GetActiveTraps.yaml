  signature: int MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::GetActiveTraps() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of active traps currently placed by the marksmanship hunter.
  description: The GetActiveTraps method retrieves the count of traps that are currently
    active and deployed on the battlefield for the marksmanship hunter class. This
    includes all trap types such as Snake Trap, Freezing Trap, and other hunter traps
    that have been laid but not yet expired or removed. The method is typically used
    in AI logic to determine the hunter's current tactical deployment and to make
    decisions about when to place new traps or avoid overcommitting to trap-based
    mechanics. It does not distinguish between different trap types, but rather returns
    a cumulative count of all active traps.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of active traps currently placed
    by the hunter. Returns 0 if no traps are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (hunter->GetActiveTraps() < 3) {\n    // Place a new trap\n    hunter->CastSpell(target,\
      \ TRAP_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Trap Management in Combat Logic
    code: "int activeTraps = hunter->GetActiveTraps();\nif (activeTraps > 0) {\n \
      \   // Adjust targeting or movement based on trap presence\n    if (activeTraps\
      \ >= 2) {\n        // Avoid placing more traps, focus on other mechanics\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only counts traps that are currently active and have not yet
    expired or been removed from the battlefield. It does not include traps that are
    in the process of being placed or those that have just been triggered but not
    yet fully deployed.
  warnings: The returned value may change rapidly during combat as traps expire or
    are removed by enemy actions, so it's recommended to cache this value if used
    multiple times within a single AI decision cycle.
