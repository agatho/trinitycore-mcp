  class: AuraScript
  method: GetMaxDuration
  signature: int AuraScript::GetMaxDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum duration of the aura in milliseconds.
  description: The GetMaxDuration method returns the maximum duration that an aura
    can remain active, measured in milliseconds. This value is typically set when
    the aura is applied and defines the upper limit for how long the aura's effects
    will persist. The returned value represents the base duration before any modifications
    from haste, duration modifiers, or other game mechanics are applied. This method
    is commonly used within AuraScript implementations to determine the maximum lifetime
    of an aura for various calculations or conditional logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum duration of the aura in milliseconds.
    A value of 0 indicates that the aura has no maximum duration or is infinite.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AuraScript
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnApply(AuraEffect\
      \ const* effect, AuraEffectHandleModes mode) override\n    {\n        int maxDuration\
      \ = GetMaxDuration();\n        // Use maxDuration for calculations or logging\n\
      \        if (maxDuration > 0)\n        {\n            // Perform logic based\
      \ on maximum duration\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Max Duration for Conditional Logic
    code: "class HealingAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPeriodicTick(AuraEffect\
      \ const* effect) override\n    {\n        int maxDuration = GetMaxDuration();\n\
      \        int currentDuration = GetDuration();\n        \n        // Calculate\
      \ percentage of duration remaining\n        float percentRemaining = (float)currentDuration\
      \ / (float)maxDuration * 100.0f;\n        \n        if (percentRemaining < 25.0f)\n\
      \        {\n            // Apply special effect when aura is about to expire\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the context of an active AuraScript.
    The returned value reflects the maximum duration as originally set during aura
    application, not the current remaining duration. For the current duration, use
    GetDuration() instead.
  warnings: Do not modify the return value as it's a const reference to internal data.
    Calling this method outside of an AuraScript context may result in undefined behavior
    or access violations.
