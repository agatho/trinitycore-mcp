  class: DruidAI

  signature: bool DruidAI::IsInForm(DruidForm form) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the DruidAI instance is currently in the specified druid form.
  description: The IsInForm method determines whether the druid AI character is currently
    transformed into a specific druid form, such as Cat Form, Bear Form, or Moonkin
    Form. This method is essential for AI decision-making processes that depend on
    the druid's current transformation state. It evaluates the druid's active form
    and returns true if it matches the specified form, false otherwise. The method
    does not modify any state but provides a read-only check of the current form status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the druid AI is currently in the specified form; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Druid is in Cat Form
    code: "if (druidAI->IsInForm(DruidForm::CAT_FORM)) {\n    // Perform cat form\
      \ specific actions\n    DoMeleeAttack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Druid Form
    code: "if (druidAI->IsInForm(DruidForm::BEAR_FORM)) {\n    // Use defensive abilities\n\
      \    UseBarkskin();\n} else if (druidAI->IsInForm(DruidForm::MOONKIN_FORM))\
      \ {\n    // Cast healing spells\n    CastHeal();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the druid's form. It
    should be used in conjunction with form switching logic to ensure accurate behavior.
    The method is typically called during AI update cycles to make decisions based
    on current transformation status.
  warnings: Ensure that the DruidForm enum values passed to this method are valid
    and correspond to actual druid forms defined in the TrinityCore codebase. Using
    invalid form values may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect return values.
