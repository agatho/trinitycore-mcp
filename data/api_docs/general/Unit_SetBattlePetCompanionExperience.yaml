documentation:
  brief: Sets the experience value for a battle pet companion.
  description: This method updates the experience value associated with a battle pet
    companion, allowing developers to control the progression and growth of battle
    pets within the game. The method is typically used in conjunction with battle
    pet mechanics and can be applied to modify the experience required for leveling
    up battle pet companions. It does not directly affect the player's character experience
    but rather influences the battle pet system's internal progression mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: experience
    description: The experience value to set for the battle pet companion. This value
      determines how much experience is required to level up the companion and should
      be within valid game range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Battle Pet Experience
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetBattlePetCompanion();

      unit->SetBattlePetCompanionExperience(1000);

      // Sets the experience to 1000 for the battle pet companion'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the battle pet system and should be used carefully
    as it affects game balance. The experience value must be within valid range for
    battle pet progression, typically between 0 and 1000000.
  warnings: This method may not directly affect player experience but rather influences
    battle pet companion progression. Using incorrect values can cause game imbalance
    or unexpected behavior in battle pet system.
