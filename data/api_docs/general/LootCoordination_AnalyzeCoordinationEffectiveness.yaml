  class: LootCoordination
  method: AnalyzeCoordinationEffectiveness
  signature: void LootCoordination::AnalyzeCoordinationEffectiveness(Group * group,
    const LootSession & session)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the effectiveness of loot coordination within a group during a loot
    session.
  description: The AnalyzeCoordinationEffectiveness method evaluates how well players
    in a group are coordinating their loot decisions during a specific loot session.
    It assesses factors such as loot distribution fairness, adherence to loot rules
    (like need-before-greed), and overall group efficiency in managing shared loot.
    This method is typically invoked after a loot session concludes to provide insights
    into coordination performance, which can be used for gameplay optimization or
    debugging purposes. The analysis considers the group's current loot settings,
    player roles, and individual participation in the loot process.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose loot coordination
      is being analyzed. Must be a valid group with active members.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to the LootSession object containing details about the
      loot session being evaluated. Includes information such as loot items, roll
      results, and distribution outcomes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyLootHandler::ProcessLootSession(Group* group, const LootSession&\
      \ session)\n{\n    LootCoordination coordination;\n    coordination.AnalyzeCoordinationEffectiveness(group,\
      \ session);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Logging
    code: "void MyLootHandler::AnalyzeAndLogCoordination(Group* group, const LootSession&\
      \ session)\n{\n    LootCoordination coordination;\n    coordination.AnalyzeCoordinationEffectiveness(group,\
      \ session);\n    // Log results or trigger further actions based on analysis\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for internal game mechanics evaluation and
    may not directly affect gameplay unless integrated with additional systems. It
    assumes that the provided group and session objects are valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that both the Group and LootSession parameters are valid before
    calling this method, as invalid pointers or uninitialized objects could lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes.
