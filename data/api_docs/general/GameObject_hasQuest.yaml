documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the GameObject has a specific quest assigned to it.
  description: This method determines if a particular quest has been assigned to the
    GameObject, which is commonly used in quest-related systems and game mechanics.
    It evaluates the quest assignment status of the GameObject and returns true if
    the specified quest_id is associated with the object, otherwise false. The method
    is typically used during quest completion checks or when verifying quest assignments
    for GameObjects in the World of Warcraft client.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject has the specified quest assigned to it,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the quest is active or assigned to the
    GameObject.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Check
    code: "if (gameobject->hasQuest(12345)) {\n    // Quest is assigned\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObject's quest management system and should
    be used in conjunction with other quest-related methods. Performance considerations
    are minimal as it simply checks internal quest assignment data.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where quest assignment
    might change dynamically, as it only reflects the current state of quest assignment
    at the time of call.
