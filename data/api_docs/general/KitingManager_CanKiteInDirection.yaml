  class: KitingManager
  method: CanKiteInDirection
  signature: bool KitingManager::CanKiteInDirection(const int & direction, float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit can kite in the specified direction based on movement
    and positioning constraints.
  description: The CanKiteInDirection method evaluates if a unit is capable of performing
    a kiting maneuver in a given direction. Kiting is a combat technique where a unit
    moves away from an enemy while maintaining attack range, typically used to avoid
    melee attacks or manage aggro. This method considers factors such as the unit's
    current position, movement capabilities, and environmental constraints to determine
    if the specified directional movement would be valid for kiting purposes. It returns
    true if the direction allows for safe and effective kiting behavior, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: direction
    description: The target direction in which to evaluate kiting capability, typically
      represented as an angle in degrees or radians. This parameter defines the intended
      movement direction for the kiting action.
  - name: distance
    description: The distance to move in the specified direction, measured in yards
      or game units. This value determines how far the unit should kite in the given
      direction.
  returns: Returns true if the unit can successfully kite in the specified direction
    for the given distance without violating movement constraints or positional limitations;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic kiting check
    code: "if (kitingManager->CanKiteInDirection(90, 10.0f)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ kiting to the east\n    unit->MoveTo(90, 10.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced kiting validation
    code: "float direction = GetFacingToTarget();\nfloat distance = CalculateOptimalKiteDistance();\n\
      if (kitingManager->CanKiteInDirection(direction, distance)) {\n    // Execute\
      \ kiting movement\n    unit->StartKiting(direction, distance);\n} else {\n \
      \   // Adjust strategy or avoid kiting\n    unit->Flee();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with the unit's movement system and collision
    detection to assess whether a kiting maneuver is feasible. It may consider terrain,
    obstacles, and combat range limitations when evaluating directional movement.
    The implementation might also factor in the unit's current speed, acceleration,
    and turning capabilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the direction parameter is properly normalized (e.g., between
    0-360 degrees) to avoid unexpected behavior. This method should not be used as
    a standalone movement command but rather as a validation step before initiating
    kiting actions.
