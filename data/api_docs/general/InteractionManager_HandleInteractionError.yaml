documentation:
  brief: Handles interaction errors for a bot player during World of Warcraft interactions
  description: The HandleInteractionError method processes and manages error conditions
    that occur when a bot player attempts to interact with game objects, NPCs, or
    other entities within the TrinityCore framework. This method is responsible for
    logging appropriate error messages, updating the bot's interaction state, and
    potentially triggering fallback behaviors or error recovery mechanisms. The method
    takes a Player pointer representing the bot and an InteractionResult enum value
    indicating the specific type of interaction failure that occurred. It serves as
    a central error handling point for the bot's interaction system, ensuring consistent
    error management across different types of interactions such as quest acceptance,
    vendor transactions, or gossip selections.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that encountered
      the interaction error. Must be a valid player instance, typically a bot controlled
      by the AI system.
  - name: error
    description: The InteractionResult enum value indicating the type of interaction
      error that occurred. This parameter specifies what kind of failure happened
      during the interaction attempt, such as invalid target, insufficient resources,
      or permission denied.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Handling Example
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnInteractionFailed(Player* bot, InteractionResult error)\n\
      {\n    sInteractionManager->HandleInteractionError(bot, error);\n    // Additional\
      \ error-specific handling can be added here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Error Recovery Example
    code: "void BotInteractionSystem::ProcessInteractionResult(Player* bot, InteractionResult\
      \ result)\n{\n    switch (result)\n    {\n        case INTERACTION_ERROR_INVALID_TARGET:\n\
      \            sInteractionManager->HandleInteractionError(bot, result);\n   \
      \         // Attempt to find alternative target\n            break;\n      \
      \  case INTERACTION_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES:\n            sInteractionManager->HandleInteractionError(bot,\
      \ result);\n            // Try to acquire necessary resources\n            break;\n\
      \        default:\n            sInteractionManager->HandleInteractionError(bot,\
      \ result);\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the interaction system when
    an interaction fails. Developers should ensure that bot instances passed to this
    method are valid and properly initialized. The method may trigger various internal
    state changes in the bot's AI system, so calling it from within critical sections
    of code should be avoided if possible.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the bot parameter will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all Player pointers are validated before calling
    this method. This method may modify the bot's internal state and should not be
    called during sensitive operations where state consistency is critical.
