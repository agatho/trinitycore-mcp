documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for the guardian druid's abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all relevant
    cooldown timers for the Guardian Druid class. This method is typically called
    during the initialization or activation phase of a guardian druid, ensuring that
    all abilities start with their correct cooldown states. It ensures that abilities
    such as Swipe, Mangle, and other defensive or offensive skills are properly reset
    to their initial cooldown values before the druid begins engaging in combat or
    performing actions. This method is crucial for maintaining proper game balance
    and preventing unintended ability usage during the early stages of a druid's activation.

      // Cooldowns are now initialized for the guardian druid'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of a Guardian
    Druid instance. Repeated calls may lead to unexpected behavior or reset active
    cooldowns unnecessarily.
