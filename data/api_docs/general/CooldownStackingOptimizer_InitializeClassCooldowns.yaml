  brief: Initializes class-specific cooldowns for the CooldownStackingOptimizer
  description: The InitializeClassCooldowns method sets up and configures all class-based
    cooldown mechanisms within the CooldownStackingOptimizer. This method is responsible
    for establishing baseline cooldown states, registering class-specific abilities,
    and preparing the optimizer to handle cooldown stacking calculations for player
    classes. It typically runs during character initialization or when switching classes
    to ensure proper cooldown tracking and optimization. The method does not require
    any input parameters and prepares internal data structures needed for subsequent
    cooldown management operations.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeClassCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per character session or when class
    changes occur. It initializes internal cooldown tracking structures that are essential
    for accurate cooldown stacking calculations in combat scenarios.
