  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all quest objective criteria for the associated player or entity
  description: The Reset method clears and reinitializes all quest objective criteria
    tracking for the player or game entity managed by the QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr.
    This typically occurs when a quest is reset, abandoned, or when the player logs
    out and back in, ensuring that progress toward quest objectives starts fresh.
    The method invalidates existing criteria data and prepares the manager to track
    new progress from scratch. It's commonly invoked during quest state transitions
    to maintain consistency in the game's quest tracking system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr* criteriaMgr = player->GetQuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr();

      criteriaMgr->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when quest state changes are confirmed
    to prevent inconsistent progress tracking. It's typically not thread-safe and
    should be executed on the main game thread or within a synchronized context.
  warnings: Calling Reset() during active quest progression may cause loss of current
    objective data, potentially leading to incorrect quest completion states if not
    properly coordinated with the quest system.
