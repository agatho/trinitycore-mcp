  brief: Initiates the Vengeance metamorphosis ability for a demon hunter AI.
  description: The CastMetamorphosisVengeance method triggers the Vengeance specialization's
    metamorphosis ability within the DemonHunterAI class. This ability transforms
    the demon hunter into a powerful vengeful form, enhancing their damage output
    and granting special abilities. The method typically handles the casting logic,
    including cooldown management, resource requirements, and visual effects. It is
    designed to be called during AI decision-making processes when the demon hunter
    should activate this key ability based on combat conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30.0f && !me->HasAura(SPELL_METAMORPHOSIS_VENGEANCE))\n    {\n        CastMetamorphosisVengeance();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires the demon hunter to have sufficient resources
    (such as Fury) and must not be on cooldown. The implementation may include checks
    for valid targets or combat state before casting.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying preconditions might lead to invalid
    ability usage or client-side errors. Ensure that the AI context is appropriate
    for casting Vengeance metamorphosis.
