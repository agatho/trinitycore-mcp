  method: EndAllPvECombat
  signature: void CombatManager::EndAllPvECombat(UnitFilter * unitFilter)
documentation:
  brief: Ends all PvE combat for units matching the specified filter.
  description: The EndAllPvECombat method terminates all ongoing Player versus Environment
    (PvE) combat sessions for units that match the provided UnitFilter criteria. This
    method is typically used to forcefully clear combat states, such as when a player
    logs out, enters an area where combat is prohibited, or during server maintenance.
    It ensures that no unit remains in combat status with NPCs or environment-based
    threats. The method operates on a filtered set of units rather than all units
    in the world, allowing for targeted cleanup of combat states.
  parameters:
  - name: unitFilter
    description: A pointer to a UnitFilter object that defines which units should
      have their PvE combat ended. If null, the method may apply to all units or behave
      as a no-op depending on implementation.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: End combat for all players in a specific zone
    code: 'UnitFilter zoneFilter = UnitFilter::CreateZoneFilter(1234); // Zone ID

      CombatManager::EndAllPvECombat(&zoneFilter);

      // All players in zone 1234 will have their PvE combat ended'
    language: cpp
  - title: End combat for a specific player unit
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid Player pointer

      UnitFilter playerFilter = UnitFilter::CreateUnitFilter(targetPlayer);

      CombatManager::EndAllPvECombat(&playerFilter);

      // Only the specified player''s PvE combat will be ended'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through active combat sessions and calls internal
    cleanup routines on matching units. It may trigger combat state change events
    or send updates to clients to reflect the end of combat. Performance can vary
    depending on how many units match the filter criteria.
  warnings: Calling this method with a poorly defined UnitFilter could result in unintended
    combat termination for many units, potentially disrupting gameplay. Ensure filters
    are specific and tested before use in production environments.
