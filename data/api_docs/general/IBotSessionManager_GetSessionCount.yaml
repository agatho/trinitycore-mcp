  method: GetSessionCount
  signature: uint32 IBotSessionManager::GetSessionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of active bot sessions managed by the session
    manager.
  description: The GetSessionCount method returns the current count of active bot
    sessions within the IBotSessionManager instance. This value represents how many
    individual bot client connections are currently established and being managed
    by the system. The method is typically used for monitoring, debugging, or administrative
    purposes to understand the scale of bot activity. It provides a snapshot of session
    utilization at the time of the call and does not account for sessions that may
    be in transition states such as connecting or disconnecting. This count includes
    all valid sessions regardless of their specific type or configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active bot sessions currently
    managed by this IBotSessionManager instance. Returns zero if no sessions are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Session Count
    code: "uint32 sessionCount = botSessionManager->GetSessionCount();\nif (sessionCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Active bot sessions: \" << sessionCount << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Session Count for Resource Management
    code: "uint32 currentSessions = botSessionManager->GetSessionCount();\nif (currentSessions\
      \ >= MAX_BOT_SESSIONS)\n{\n    // Prevent new sessions from being created\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Maximum bot session limit reached: %u\", currentSessions);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Allow creation of new bot session\n    CreateNewBotSession();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread without requiring
    external synchronization. The returned value is a snapshot and may change immediately
    after the call due to concurrent session creation or destruction. For performance-critical
    applications, consider caching this value rather than calling it repeatedly.
  warnings: The session count returned does not include sessions in transitional states
    (connecting, disconnecting). If you need to track all sessions including those
    in transition, additional logic must be implemented. Also, this method should
    not be used as a primary indicator for session lifecycle management since the
    value can change between calls.
