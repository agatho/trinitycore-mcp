  brief: Updates internal performance metrics for the economy system
  description: The UpdatePerformanceMetrics method collects and processes various
    performance-related data within the EconomyManager class. This includes tracking
    transaction rates, resource usage, and system responsiveness to ensure optimal
    gameplay economics. The method is typically invoked periodically or in response
    to significant economic events such as market fluctuations or player activity
    spikes. It helps maintain balanced game mechanics by monitoring how the economy
    system performs under different load conditions.

    system events rather than being invoked directly by scripts or external code.
