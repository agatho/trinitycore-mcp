  method: ValidateTradeItems
  signature: bool TradeManager::ValidateTradeItems() const
documentation:
  brief: Validates all items in the current trade session for legality and restrictions
  description: The ValidateTradeItems method checks whether all items involved in
    the current trade transaction meet the necessary requirements and restrictions
    set by the game's trading system. This includes verifying item validity, stack
    limits, tradeable status, and any other constraints that prevent an item from
    being traded. The method ensures that no invalid or restricted items are included
    in a trade before it is finalized. It returns true if all items pass validation
    checks, and false otherwise. This method is typically called during the trade
    process to maintain game integrity and prevent exploits.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all items in the current trade session pass validation
    checks and are allowed to be traded; returns false if any item fails validation
    or violates trading restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Validation Check
    code: "if (tradeManager.ValidateTradeItems()) {\n    // Proceed with trade completion\n\
      \    tradeManager.FinalizeTrade();\n} else {\n    // Cancel trade and notify\
      \ players\n    tradeManager.CancelTrade();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during the trade process,
    but may also be called manually in custom trade implementations. The validation
    includes checking item quality, level requirements, binding status, and account-bound
    restrictions. Performance-wise, this method should be lightweight as it's called
    frequently during trade operations.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of a valid trade session context, as it
    may access invalid memory or produce undefined behavior. This method assumes that
    the trade state is properly initialized and that item references are valid.
