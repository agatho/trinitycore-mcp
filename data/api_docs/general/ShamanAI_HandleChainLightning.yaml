  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandleChainLightning
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleChainLightning(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the chain lightning spell targeting a specified unit.
  description: The HandleChainLightning method is responsible for executing the Shaman's
    Chain Lightning ability, which deals damage to a primary target and jumps to nearby
    enemies. This method determines whether the spell can be cast successfully based
    on available mana, line of sight, and target validity. It handles the logic for
    selecting targets, calculating damage, and applying the spell effect. The method
    returns true if the spell was successfully cast, or false if it failed due to
    insufficient resources or invalid conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      This parameter is used to determine which unit will be the primary target of
      the chain lightning spell.
  returns: Returns true if the chain lightning spell was successfully cast, otherwise
    returns false. The method may return false due to insufficient mana, invalid target,
    or other casting conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleChainLightning
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nif (shamanAI->HandleChainLightning(&targetId)) {\n\
      \    // Spell successfully cast\n    printf(\"Chain Lightning cast successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to cast spell\n    printf(\"Failed to cast Chain\
      \ Lightning\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Shaman AI behavior system and integrates with
    TrinityCore's combat mechanics. The target parameter should be validated before
    calling this method to ensure it points to a valid unit. Performance-wise, this
    method may involve multiple target checks and damage calculations which could
    impact frame rate during high-combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly initialized and points to a
    valid unit before passing it to this method. Passing an invalid or null pointer
    could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes proper mana management
    has already been handled by the calling code.
