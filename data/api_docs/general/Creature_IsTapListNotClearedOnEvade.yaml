  signature: bool Creature::IsTapListNotClearedOnEvade() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature's tap list remains intact after evading.
  description: This method checks if the creature's tap list is cleared when the creature
    evades from combat. It returns true if the tap list remains intact and false if
    it is cleared upon evading. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper
    creature behavior during combat mechanics, particularly in scenarios where creatures
    need to retain their target list after evading to prevent unintended loss of targeting
    or engagement. The method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related
    functions to ensure accurate creature state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the tap list remains intact after evading, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the creature maintains its target list when evading from
    combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->IsTapListNotClearedOnEvade())\n{\n    // Creature maintains\
      \ its tap list after evading\n    // Do something with the creature's target\
      \ list\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Creature clears its tap list upon evading\n    //\
      \ Handle the cleared target list appropriately\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat management systems to determine if
    creatures should retain their target list after evading. It's important for maintaining
    proper game mechanics and preventing unintended loss of targeting during combat
    transitions.
  warnings: This method may not be directly accessible in all situations, as it depends
    on the creature's internal state and combat behavior. Care should be taken when
    using this method to ensure proper handling of creature target lists after evading.
