  method: IsExpired
  signature: bool DetectedSpellCast::IsExpired() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a detected spell cast has expired based on its duration and
    start time.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if a DetectedSpellCast object has exceeded
    its valid duration since being initiated. This is typically used in AI systems
    or spell detection logic to identify when a previously detected spell cast is
    no longer relevant or active. The method evaluates internal timing data to make
    this determination, ensuring that outdated spell cast information does not interfere
    with current gameplay mechanics. It's commonly called during update loops or event
    processing to clean up old spell cast detections and maintain accurate state tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the detected spell cast has expired (i.e., its duration
    has passed since initiation), otherwise returns false. This indicates that the
    spell cast should be removed from active detection lists or considered invalid
    for further processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& detectedSpell\
      \ : m_detectedSpells)\n    {\n        if (detectedSpell.IsExpired())\n     \
      \   {\n            // Remove expired spell cast from detection list\n      \
      \      m_detectedSpells.remove(detectedSpell);\n            continue;\n    \
      \    }\n        // Process non-expired spell casts\n        ProcessSpellCast(detectedSpell);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal timing mechanisms and should only be called
    on valid DetectedSpellCast instances. The expiration logic typically uses the
    spell's cast time, duration, and current game time to determine validity. Performance
    is generally minimal as it only involves time comparisons.
  warnings: Do not assume that all detected spell casts will eventually expire - some
    may persist indefinitely if their duration is set to infinite or if they are manually
    managed. Also, calling this method on a destroyed or invalid DetectedSpellCast
    instance could lead to undefined behavior.
