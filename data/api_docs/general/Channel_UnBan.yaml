  method: UnBan
  signature: void Channel::UnBan(const Player * player, const std::string & badname)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the banned list of a channel.
  description: The UnBan method removes a specified player from the ban list of a
    channel. This allows previously banned players to rejoin the channel if they were
    removed from the ban list. The method operates on the channel's internal ban list
    and does not directly interact with the player object or database. It is typically
    called when a moderator or channel owner decides to lift a ban on a specific user.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the moderator or channel
      owner performing the unban action. Must not be null.
  - name: badname
    description: String containing the name of the player to be unbanned from the
      channel. The name must match exactly with the banned player's name in the channel's
      ban list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Unban a player from a channel
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"Trade\", player->GetTeam());\n\
      if (channel)\n{\n    channel->UnBan(player, \"BannedPlayer\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player performing the unban has sufficient permissions
    to modify the channel's ban list. It does not validate whether the player was
    actually banned before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with a non-existent or already unbanned player name
    will have no effect but may result in unnecessary processing. Ensure proper permission
    checks are performed before invoking this method.
