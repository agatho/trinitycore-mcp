  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: IsDispellableDebuff
  signature: bool MechanicAwareness::IsDispellableDebuff(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell with the specified ID is classified as a dispellable
    debuff in the game mechanics.
  description: The IsDispellableDebuff method checks if a given spell ID corresponds
    to a spell that can be removed through magical dispelling effects such as Remove
    Curse, Abolish Poison, or similar abilities. This method evaluates the spell's
    properties and flags within the TrinityCore database to determine if it is considered
    a debuff that can be cleansed. It is commonly used in spell handling systems,
    aura management, and player interaction logic where dispel mechanics are relevant.
    The method does not validate the existence of the spell ID in the database; it
    assumes valid input based on known spell definitions.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be evaluated for dispellability.
      This value must correspond to a valid spell entry in the TrinityCore spell database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell is classified as a dispellable debuff,
    otherwise returns false. A spell is considered dispellable if it has the appropriate
    flags or properties indicating it can be removed by dispel effects.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a spell is dispellable
    code: "uint32 poisonSpellId = 118; // Example: Poison\nif (mechanicAwareness->IsDispellableDebuff(poisonSpellId))\n\
      {\n    // This spell can be removed by dispel effects\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Poison is dispellable.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Poison is not\
      \ dispellable.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell flag definitions and database entries.
    Developers should ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to an actual spell
    in the TrinityCore database. The method may be used in conjunction with other
    aura or spell evaluation systems for comprehensive debuff management.
  warnings: Incorrect spell IDs might lead to unexpected behavior or false results.
    Ensure all spell IDs passed to this function are valid and exist within the game's
    spell database. This method does not perform any validation of the spell ID itself,
    so calling code should handle invalid inputs appropriately.
