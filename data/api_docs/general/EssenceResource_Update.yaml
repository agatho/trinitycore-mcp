  method: Update
  signature: void EssenceResource::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the essence resource state based on the elapsed time since last update.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing the internal state of
    an EssenceResource object, typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to handle player or creature resource systems such as mana, rage, energy, or other
    game-specific resources. This method processes the passage of time (in milliseconds)
    and adjusts the resource value accordingly, potentially applying regeneration
    rates, consumption mechanics, or cooldowns. It is commonly called from the game
    loop or update handlers to ensure that resources are accurately maintained over
    time. The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of
    the object directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'EssenceResource resource;

      resource.Update(1000); // Updates resource with 1 second elapsed time'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& player : players)\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetManaResource()->Update(diff);\n        player->GetEnergyResource()->Update(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked every game tick or update cycle. It's important
    to pass accurate time deltas (diff) to ensure proper resource behavior. The implementation
    may include logic for resource regeneration, depletion, or state transitions depending
    on the specific type of essence resource being managed.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid time delta (e.g., passing zero or
    negative values) can lead to incorrect resource calculations or unexpected behavior.
    Ensure that the diff parameter reflects actual elapsed game time in milliseconds.
