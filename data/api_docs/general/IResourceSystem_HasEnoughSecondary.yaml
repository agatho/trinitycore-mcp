  signature: bool IResourceSystem::HasEnoughSecondary(uint32 amount) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has sufficient secondary resource to meet a specified
    requirement.
  description: The HasEnoughSecondary method determines whether the current player
    possesses enough of a secondary resource (such as mana, rage, energy, or focus)
    to fulfill a given amount requirement. This method is typically used in spell
    and ability validation logic within the TrinityCore framework to ensure that players
    have adequate resources before executing actions. It does not modify any resource
    values but simply performs a comparison between the player's current secondary
    resource and the requested amount.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's current secondary resource is greater than
    or equal to the specified amount; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Validation
    code: "if (player->GetResourceSystem()->HasEnoughSecondary(50)) {\n    // Player\
      \ has at least 50 mana\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Not enough mana to cast spell\n    player->SendSpellFailed(PLAYER_SPELL_FAILED_NO_MANA);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Resource Before Ability Execution
    code: "uint32 requiredRage = 10;\nif (player->GetResourceSystem()->HasEnoughSecondary(requiredRage))\
      \ {\n    player->ModifyPower(POWER_RAGE, -requiredRage);\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SLAM, true);\n} else {\n    player->SendSpellFailed(PLAYER_SPELL_FAILED_NO_RAGE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the IResourceSystem instance is properly initialized
    and that the player has a valid secondary resource type associated with it. The
    method relies on the internal state of the player's resource system, which may
    be updated by various game events or actions.
