documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SpatialQueryOptimizer instance as a copy of an existing
    one.
  description: The SpatialQueryOptimizer constructor is used to create a new instance
    of the SpatialQueryOptimizer class by copying the state from another existing
    instance. This method performs a deep copy of the internal data structures and
    configuration settings, ensuring that the newly created object is independent
    of the source object. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server
    implementation, this optimizer is typically used to enhance spatial query performance
    for entities such as players, creatures, and game objects within the game world.
    It may involve caching or pre-processing spatial data structures to improve lookup
    times during collision detection, visibility calculations, or other spatial operations.

  - title: Copy Construction Example
    code: 'SpatialQueryOptimizer original;

      // ... configure original ...

      SpatialQueryOptimizer copy(original); // Uses the copy constructor

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked when creating a new SpatialQueryOptimizer
    instance that should mirror an existing one's configuration and internal state.
    It is important to note that this is a copy constructor, not a default constructor,
    so it requires a valid source object to be passed in.
