documentation:
  brief: Updates the performance profile cache with current data values.
  description: The UpdateCache method refreshes the internal cache of performance
    metrics within the PerformanceProfile class. This method is typically invoked
    to synchronize cached data with real-time system measurements or configuration
    changes. It ensures that subsequent reads from the performance profile return
    up-to-date information. The method does not take any parameters and performs no
    direct return operations, making it a pure data synchronization utility. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining accurate profiling data in TrinityCore's
    performance monitoring systems.

  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not block execution
    for extended periods. It is recommended to call this method periodically during
    active profiling sessions to maintain data accuracy.
