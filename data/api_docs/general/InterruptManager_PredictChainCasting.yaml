  class: InterruptManager
  method: PredictChainCasting
  signature: void InterruptManager::PredictChainCasting(Unit * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts and handles chain casting interrupts for a given caster unit.
  description: The PredictChainCasting method analyzes the casting behavior of a specified
    unit to determine if their current or upcoming spell casts might be interrupted
    by external factors such as damage, movement, or other game mechanics. This method
    is typically used within the interrupt management system to proactively assess
    and potentially cancel or modify spell casts before they complete. It evaluates
    the caster's state, including their current spell queue, casting status, and potential
    interrupt triggers to ensure proper handling of chain casting scenarios in combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Interrupt Handler
    code: "void MyInterruptHandler(Unit* caster)\n{\n    InterruptManager::PredictChainCasting(caster);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void CombatAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_caster && m_caster->IsCasting())\n\
      \    {\n        InterruptManager::PredictChainCasting(m_caster);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore core to manage
    spell casting interruptions. It does not directly modify spell states but rather
    predicts potential outcomes of chain casting sequences. The method should be called
    during appropriate game ticks or interrupt events to maintain accurate state tracking.
  warnings: This function assumes that the provided Unit pointer is valid and in a
    consistent state. Calling this method with an invalid or null unit pointer may
    lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, since it's part of the interrupt system,
    it should only be invoked when appropriate game logic conditions are met to avoid
    performance overhead.
