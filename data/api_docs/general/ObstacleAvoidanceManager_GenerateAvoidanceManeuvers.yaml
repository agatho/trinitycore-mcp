  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: GenerateAvoidanceManeuvers
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GenerateAvoidanceManeuvers(const CollisionPrediction
    & collision)
documentation:
  brief: Generates avoidance maneuvers to prevent collisions with obstacles in the
    game world.
  description: The GenerateAvoidanceManeuvers method calculates and returns a set
    of movement adjustments or alternative paths that an AI-controlled unit should
    take to avoid colliding with detected obstacles. This method is typically invoked
    during pathfinding or movement updates when collision prediction has identified
    potential conflicts. It evaluates the current position, movement direction, and
    obstacle data to determine optimal avoidance strategies. The returned integer
    value usually indicates the success status of maneuver generation, where zero
    often signifies success and negative values may indicate failure or no viable
    maneuvers were found.
  parameters:
  - name: collision
    description: A reference to a CollisionPrediction object containing data about
      predicted collisions, including obstacle positions, sizes, and movement vectors
      that could lead to conflicts.
  returns: An integer representing the result of maneuver generation. Typically, zero
    indicates successful generation of avoidance maneuvers, while negative values
    may indicate failure or no applicable maneuvers were computed. Positive non-zero
    values might denote specific types of avoidance actions taken.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Movement Update
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_obstacleAvoidanceManager)\n\
      \    {\n        CollisionPrediction collision;\n        // Assume collision\
      \ data is populated\n        int result = m_obstacleAvoidanceManager->GenerateAvoidanceManeuvers(collision);\n\
      \        if (result >= 0)\n        {\n            // Proceed with applying avoidance\
      \ maneuvers\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI movement system and relies heavily on accurate
    collision detection data. It should be called frequently during unit updates to
    ensure responsive obstacle avoidance behavior. Performance can be impacted by
    complex obstacle geometries or high-frequency calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the CollisionPrediction object passed to this method contains
    valid and up-to-date data; otherwise, generated maneuvers may be incorrect or
    ineffective. Avoid calling this method in performance-critical sections without
    proper optimization due to potential computational overhead.
