  class: Player
  method: UpdatePosition
  signature: bool Player::UpdatePosition(const Position & pos, bool teleport)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's position in the world, optionally teleporting them to
    a new location.
  description: The UpdatePosition method is used to change a player's location within
    the game world. When called with teleport set to true, it immediately moves the
    player to the specified position without any movement animation or pathfinding.
    When teleport is false, it may trigger movement logic such as walking or running
    to the new location. This method is typically used for administrative commands,
    quest triggers, or when a player needs to be relocated within the game world.
    The method returns true if the position update was successful and false otherwise,
    which could happen due to invalid coordinates, terrain restrictions, or other
    game state constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The new Position object containing X, Y, Z coordinates and orientation
      (o) that the player should be moved to.
  - name: teleport
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to teleport the player immediately
      (true) or move them with normal movement behavior (false).
  returns: Returns true if the position update was successful, false otherwise. Failure
    can occur due to invalid coordinates, terrain restrictions, or other game state
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Teleport player to specific coordinates
    code: 'Position newPosition(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f, 0.0f);

      player->UpdatePosition(newPosition, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move player with normal movement behavior
    code: 'Position targetPosition(150.0f, 250.0f, 60.0f, 0.0f);

      player->UpdatePosition(targetPosition, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the provided Position object
    before attempting to update the player's location. It is recommended to validate
    coordinates against world boundaries and terrain data before calling this method.
    The teleport parameter affects how movement is handled internally, with true bypassing
    normal movement checks and animations.
  warnings: Using teleport=true can cause unexpected behavior if the destination position
    is invalid or outside of valid world bounds. This may result in players becoming
    stuck or invisible to other players. Always ensure that Position objects passed
    to this method are valid before calling.
