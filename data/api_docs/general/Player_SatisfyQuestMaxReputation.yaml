documentation:
  brief: Sets quest reputation to maximum for the player
  description: This method ensures that a player's reputation with the faction associated
    with a specific quest reaches its maximum value. It is typically used when completing
    quests that involve reputation rewards, allowing players to bypass normal reputation
    progression requirements. The method returns true if the reputation was successfully
    set to maximum, false otherwise. This functionality is particularly useful in
    scenarios where players need to quickly reach maximum reputation levels for a
    quest faction without having to complete all required quest steps.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that contains the reputation information
      to be set to maximum
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to send a message to the player about
      the reputation change
  returns: Returns true if the quest reputation was successfully set to maximum, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if the quest does not have a valid reputation
    faction or if the player's reputation cannot be adjusted due to game mechanics
    restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      bool success = player->SatisfyQuestMaxReputation(quest, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nQuest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (player->SatisfyQuestMaxReputation(quest, false)) {\n    // Reputation set\
      \ to maximum without message\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the player's reputation state and bypasses
    normal quest progression. It should be used carefully as it may affect game balance
    and progression. Implementation involves checking if the quest has valid reputation
    information and ensuring that the player's faction is properly set to maximum
    value.
  warnings: This method should not be used for regular quest completion as it bypasses
    normal reputation progression mechanics. Using this method inappropriately can
    lead to game imbalance or unexpected behavior during quest progression. It may
    also cause issues if used with quests that don't have reputation information.
