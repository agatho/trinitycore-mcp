  method: GetArtifactPowerIndex
  signature: int32 Item::GetArtifactPowerIndex(uint32 artifactPowerId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the index of an artifact power within the item's artifact power
    array.
  description: The GetArtifactPowerIndex method is used to find the specific index
    position of a given artifact power ID within the artifact item's internal array
    of artifact powers. This method is primarily utilized in World of Warcraft's artifact
    system, where items can possess multiple artifact powers that contribute to their
    overall functionality and progression. The returned index allows for efficient
    access and manipulation of specific artifact power data. This method does not
    modify any state and is typically called during artifact power management or display
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the zero-based index of the specified artifact power ID within
    the item's artifact power array. If the artifact power ID is not found, the method
    returns -1 to indicate an invalid or non-existent power index.
  examples:
  - title: Finding Artifact Power Index
    code: "Item* artifactItem = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);\nif (artifactItem &&\
      \ artifactItem->GetTemplate()->HasArtifactPower()) {\n    int32 powerIndex =\
      \ artifactItem->GetArtifactPowerIndex(67890);\n    if (powerIndex >= 0) {\n\
      \        // Successfully found the artifact power at index\n        printf(\"\
      Found artifact power at index: %d\\n\", powerIndex);\n    } else {\n       \
      \ // Artifact power not found\n        printf(\"Artifact power not found in\
      \ item\\n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the item is an artifact and has valid artifact power
    data. The method performs a linear search through the artifact power array, so
    performance may degrade with large numbers of artifact powers. It's recommended
    to cache results when frequently accessing the same artifact power indices.
  warnings: The method returns -1 for invalid artifact power IDs, which can be confused
    with a valid index of 0. Always check for negative return values before using
    the result as an array index. This method should only be called on items that
    are confirmed to be artifacts.
