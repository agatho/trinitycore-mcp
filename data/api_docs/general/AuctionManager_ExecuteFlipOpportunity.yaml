api:
  class: AuctionManager
  method: ExecuteFlipOpportunity
  signature: bool AuctionManager::ExecuteFlipOpportunity(Player * bot, const FlipOpportunity
    & opportunity)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a flip opportunity for the specified bot player by purchasing an
    item at a lower price and reselling it for profit.
  description: The ExecuteFlipOpportunity method is responsible for processing auction
    flip opportunities within the TrinityCore AuctionHouse system. It evaluates whether
    a given flip opportunity (defined by a FlipOpportunity structure) can be executed
    successfully by the provided bot player. The method checks if the bot has sufficient
    funds, if the item is still available in the auction house, and performs the necessary
    transactions to buy low and sell high. This function is typically used in automated
    bot systems or AI-driven trading strategies within World of Warcraft's auction
    house mechanics. The method returns true upon successful execution of the flip
    opportunity, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the flip opportunity. Must be a valid player instance with sufficient funds
      and access to the auction house.
  - name: opportunity
    description: Reference to a FlipOpportunity structure containing details about
      the item to flip, including buy price, sell price, item template ID, and other
      relevant auction data.
  returns: Boolean value indicating success (true) or failure (false) of executing
    the flip opportunity. Returns false if the bot lacks funds, the item is no longer
    available, or any other transaction error occurs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flip Opportunity Execution
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nFlipOpportunity flip;\n\
      flip.itemId = 12345;\nflip.buyPrice = 10000;\nflip.sellPrice = 15000;\nbool\
      \ success = sAuctionMgr->ExecuteFlipOpportunity(myBot, flip);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Flip executed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Flip Opportunity with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nFlipOpportunity opportunity;\nopportunity.itemId =\
      \ 67890;\nopportunity.buyPrice = 50000;\nopportunity.sellPrice = 75000;\n\n\
      if (sAuctionMgr->ExecuteFlipOpportunity(bot, opportunity)) {\n    // Log successful\
      \ flip\n    sLog->outString(\"Successfully executed flip for item %u\", opportunity.itemId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle failed flip attempt\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to\
      \ execute flip for item %u\", opportunity.itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FlipOpportunity structure contains valid data
    and that the bot player has proper access to the auction house system. It may
    perform multiple database operations internally, so it should be used judiciously
    in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player is properly initialized and has sufficient
    gold before calling this method. Improper handling of return values can lead to
    incorrect financial calculations or failed transactions.
