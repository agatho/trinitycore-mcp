    classId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the fallback class expansion availability data for a specified class
    ID
  description: Retrieves the fallback ClassAvailability structure that defines the
    expansion requirements for a given class when no specific override is present.
    This method is used internally by the ObjectMgr to determine default expansion
    compatibility for classes that do not have custom expansion requirements defined
    in the database. The returned pointer provides access to expansion level data
    such as minimum and maximum expansions required for class availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a ClassAvailability structure containing the fallback
    expansion requirements for the requested class, or nullptr if no fallback data
    exists for the specified class ID
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve fallback expansion requirements for Warrior class
    code: "const ClassAvailability* availability = sObjectMgr->GetClassExpansionRequirementFallback(CLASS_WARRIOR);\n\
      if (availability != nullptr)\n{\n    printf(\"Min Expansion: %d, Max Expansion:\
      \ %d\\n\", availability->minExpansion, availability->maxExpansion);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during server initialization and class validation
    processes. The returned ClassAvailability structure should not be modified as
    it represents shared data. The method performs a lookup in an internal cache of
    class expansion requirements.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be nullptr if no fallback data exists for the
    requested class ID, so callers must always check for null before dereferencing.
    This method does not perform any validation on the input classId parameter.
