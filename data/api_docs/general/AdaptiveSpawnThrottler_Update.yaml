  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: Update
  signature: void AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the adaptive spawn throttler's internal state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing the adaptive spawning
    logic within the TrinityCore server. It processes the time delta (diff) to determine
    when and how many creatures or game objects should be spawned or despawned in
    a given area. This method typically adjusts spawn rates dynamically based on player
    activity, server load, or other environmental factors to maintain optimal performance
    and gameplay experience. The throttler ensures that spawning does not overwhelm
    the server while still providing an engaging environment for players.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-based adjustments to spawn rates and timing
      logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;

      // In game loop or timer callback

      throttler.Update(100); // Update with 100ms elapsed time'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in World Update Loop
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other world updates...\n   \
      \ m_AdaptiveSpawnThrottler.Update(diff);\n    // Continue with other updates...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to ensure proper
    adaptive spawning behavior. The internal logic may adjust spawn intervals dynamically
    based on server conditions, so consistent updates are required for optimal performance.
