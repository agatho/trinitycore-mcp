  class: WorldObject
  method: GetZoneScript
  signature: ZoneScript * WorldObject::GetZoneScript() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the ZoneScript associated with the current zone of the WorldObject.
  description: The GetZoneScript method returns a pointer to the ZoneScript object
    that is currently active for the zone in which this WorldObject resides. This
    allows scripts and game systems to interact with zone-specific behaviors, events,
    or triggers. The returned pointer may be null if no zone script is assigned to
    the object's current zone. This method is commonly used in event handling, quest
    progression, and zone-based mechanics within TrinityCore's scripting framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ZoneScript associated with the object's current zone,
    or nullptr if no zone script exists for that zone.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Zone Script
    code: "ZoneScript* zoneScript = player->GetZoneScript();\nif (zoneScript != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Perform zone-specific actions\n    zoneScript->OnPlayerEnter(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Zone Script for Event Handling
    code: "WorldObject* object = GetWorldObject();\nZoneScript* script = object->GetZoneScript();\n\
      if (script && script->IsEnabled())\n{\n    script->HandleEvent(object, EVENT_TYPE_ENTER_ZONE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal zone tracking system of WorldObject. The
    returned ZoneScript pointer is only valid while the object exists and its zone
    has not changed. Performance-wise, this call should be infrequent in tight loops
    as it accesses zone-related data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned ZoneScript pointer is checked for null before
    use to avoid dereferencing a nullptr. Also, note that zone scripts may not always
    be loaded or initialized when an object first enters a zone, so additional checks
    might be needed depending on the context of usage.
