  method: ProcessEventReminders
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::ProcessEventReminders()
documentation:
  brief: Processes and sends out pending guild event reminders to all eligible members
  description: The ProcessEventReminders method iterates through all scheduled guild
    events and checks if any reminders need to be sent to participating members. It
    evaluates event start times against current time, determines which members have
    opted in to receive notifications, and dispatches appropriate reminder messages
    via the game's messaging system. This method is typically invoked by the server's
    periodic update loop to ensure timely communication of upcoming guild activities.
    The function handles various reminder intervals (such as 1 hour, 30 minutes, etc.)
    and ensures that duplicate notifications are not sent to the same player within
    a short time window.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Update Loop
    code: "void WorldSession::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n\
      \    sGuildEventCoordinator->ProcessEventReminders();\n    // ... more updates\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly by the server's main update loop to
    maintain proper event notification timing. The function performs database queries
    to retrieve event information and member preferences, so frequent execution may
    impact performance during high-traffic periods.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from within event handlers or other time-sensitive
    code paths as it may cause deadlocks or performance degradation. Ensure that the
    guild event coordinator is properly initialized before calling this function.
