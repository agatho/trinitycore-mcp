documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an item can be equipped or unequipped during combat.
  description: The CanChangeEquipStateInCombat method checks if an item is allowed
    to be equipped or unequipped while the player is in combat. This method evaluates
    various item properties and game rules to determine if the equip/unequip action
    is permitted during active combat. Items that cannot be changed during combat
    typically include those with special restrictions, such as quest items, soulbound
    items, or items with specific combat-related limitations. The result of this check
    affects player behavior and prevents certain actions that would otherwise be possible
    outside of combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item can be equipped or unequipped during combat; returns
    false if the item cannot be changed while in combat state.
  examples:
  - title: Check if item can be equipped in combat
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(itemId);\nif (itemTemplate->CanChangeEquipStateInCombat())\
      \ {\n    // Item can be equipped/unequipped during combat\n    printf(\"Item\
      \ can be changed in combat\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Item cannot be changed during\
      \ combat\n    printf(\"Item cannot be changed in combat\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used by the game's combat system to enforce rules
    about when items can be equipped or unequipped. It may consider item flags, quest
    status, and other properties that restrict item usage during combat.
