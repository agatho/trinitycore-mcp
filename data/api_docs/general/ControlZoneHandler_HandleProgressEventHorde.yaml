  class: ControlZoneHandler
  method: HandleProgressEventHorde
  signature: void ControlZoneHandler::HandleProgressEventHorde(GameObject * controlZone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the progression event for the Horde faction when a control zone GameObject
    is interacted with
  description: The HandleProgressEventHorde method processes the logic associated
    with advancing faction progress or triggering specific events when the Horde faction
    interacts with a control zone GameObject. This typically occurs during World of
    Warcraft's quest progression or faction-based objectives where controlling certain
    zones affects the overall game state. The method likely updates player faction
    standings, triggers quest rewards, or modifies game world conditions based on
    the control zone's state and the player's faction affiliation. It is part of the
    broader ControlZoneHandler system that manages faction-based territorial control
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: controlZone
    description: Pointer to the GameObject representing the control zone that triggered
      this event. This GameObject must be a valid control zone type with appropriate
      faction-specific behaviors and data associated with it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in GameObject Event Handler
    code: "void GameObject::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (GetGOInfo()->type == GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_CONTROL_ZONE)\n\
      \    {\n        ControlZoneHandler handler;\n        handler.HandleProgressEventHorde(this);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Interaction
    code: "void Player::HandleControlZoneInteraction(GameObject* controlZone)\n{\n\
      \    if (GetFaction() == HORDE_FACTION)\n    {\n        ControlZoneHandler handler;\n\
      \        handler.HandleProgressEventHorde(controlZone);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during GameObject update cycles or player
    interaction events. The controlZone parameter must be validated to ensure it's
    a proper control zone type before processing. Implementation may involve faction
    tracking, quest state updates, and potential world state modifications.
  warnings: Ensure that the controlZone GameObject is properly initialized and represents
    a valid control zone before calling this method. Improper handling could lead
    to incorrect faction progression or game state inconsistencies.
