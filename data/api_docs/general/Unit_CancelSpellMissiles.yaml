documentation:
  brief: Cancel spell missiles for a specific spell ID
  description: This method cancels spell missiles associated with a given spell ID,
    preventing any further missile movement or execution. It is commonly used to stop
    spell casting that involves projectile movement, such as arcane missiles or other
    spells with missile effects. The method can optionally reverse the missile direction
    and abort the spell if specified.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell whose missiles should be canceled.
      This is typically a spell ID from the Spell.dbc file or similar database.
  - name: reverseMissile
    description: When true, reverses the direction of the missile movement. When false,
      the missile continues in its original direction.
  - name: abortSpell
    description: When true, aborts the spell entirely after canceling the missiles.
      When false, only the missiles are canceled without affecting the spell's execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: Unit->CancelSpellMissiles(12345, true, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example

      \ false, true);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can affect spell mechanics and
    may cause issues if used incorrectly. It is primarily intended for use in spell
    cancellation scenarios where missile movement needs to be stopped.
  warnings: Using this method without proper understanding of spell mechanics can
    lead to unexpected behavior or errors in spell execution. Always ensure that the
    spell ID exists before calling this method.
