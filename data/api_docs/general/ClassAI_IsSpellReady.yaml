  signature: bool ClassAI::IsSpellReady(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified spell is ready to be cast by the AI-controlled unit
  description: The IsSpellReady method determines whether a given spell is currently
    available for casting by the AI-controlled creature or NPC. This check typically
    evaluates factors such as spell cooldowns, mana requirements, target validity,
    and general combat readiness. The method returns true if the spell can be cast
    immediately, and false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment,
    this method is commonly used within AI scripts to make intelligent decisions about
    when to use specific abilities during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check for readiness. This corresponds
      to the Spell.dbc entry ID in the game database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell is ready to be cast, false otherwise.
    The method will return false if the spell is on cooldown, lacks sufficient mana,
    or if other preconditions required for casting are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Readiness Check
    code: "if (ai->IsSpellReady(12345))\n{\n    // Cast the spell with ID 12345\n\
      \    me->CastSpell(target, 12345, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsSpellReady in Combat Decision Making
    code: "if (me->GetVictim() && ai->IsSpellReady(98765))\n{\n    // Use powerful\
      \ ability only when ready\n    ai->DoCast(me->GetVictim(), 98765);\n}\nelse\
      \ if (ai->IsSpellReady(11223))\n{\n    // Fallback to lesser ability\n    ai->DoCast(me->GetVictim(),\
      \ 11223);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within AI update loops or combat decision-making
    logic. It should be called before attempting to cast a spell to avoid invalid
    casts. The implementation may vary depending on the specific AI type (e.g., melee,
    ranged, spellcaster), but generally accounts for cooldowns and resource availability.
  warnings: Do not assume that a spell being ready means it can be successfully cast
    - additional checks such as line of sight or target validity should still be performed.
    Calling this method too frequently without caching results may impact performance
    in high-frequency AI logic.
