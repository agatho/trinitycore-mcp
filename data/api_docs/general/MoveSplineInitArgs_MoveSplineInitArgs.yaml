documentation:
  brief: Moves spline initialization arguments to a new instance using move semantics.
  description: The MoveSplineInitArgs constructor is a move constructor that transfers
    ownership of resources from one MoveSplineInitArgs object to another. This is
    used internally within TrinityCore's movement system to efficiently handle spline
    initialization data without unnecessary copying. The move constructor is typically
    invoked when temporary objects are created or when passing MoveSplineInitArgs
    by value in performance-critical scenarios. It ensures that the source object
    is left in a valid but unspecified state after the move operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Spline Initialization Arguments
    code: 'MoveSplineInitArgs args1;

      // ... initialize args1 ...

      MoveSplineInitArgs args2 = std::move(args1);

      // args1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // args2 contains the moved data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor utilizes C++ move semantics for efficient resource transfer.
    The source object should not be used after the move operation as its contents
    are left in an undefined but valid state. This is particularly important in TrinityCore's
    movement system where spline data can be large and copying would be inefficient.
  warnings: After calling this move constructor, the original MoveSplineInitArgs object
    must not be accessed or used, as it will be left in a valid but unspecified state.
    This differs from copy semantics where both objects remain valid.
