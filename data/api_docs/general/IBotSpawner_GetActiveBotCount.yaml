  class: IBotSpawner
  method: GetActiveBotCount
  signature: uint32 IBotSpawner::GetActiveBotCount(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of active bots within a specified zone.
  description: The GetActiveBotCount method returns the number of currently active
    bots in the given zone. This function is typically used by bot management systems
    or game logic to monitor and control bot population levels. The method operates
    on a per-zone basis, allowing for zone-specific bot tracking. It does not include
    inactive or despawned bots in the count. The returned value represents the current
    state of active bots at the time of the call.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone for which to retrieve the active
      bot count. Valid values are positive integers representing valid zone identifiers
      in the game world.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of active bots currently present
    in the specified zone. Returns zero if no bots are active or if the zone ID is
    invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 botCount = botSpawner->GetActiveBotCount(1234); // Get active bots\
      \ in zone 1234\nif (botCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process active bots\n    printf(\"\
      Active bots in zone: %u\\n\", botCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Bot Management Check
    code: "uint32 currentZone = player->GetZoneId();\nuint32 activeBots = botSpawner->GetActiveBotCount(currentZone);\n\
      if (activeBots < 10)\n{\n    // Spawn more bots if count is low\n    botSpawner->SpawnBot(currentZone);\n\
      }\nelse if (activeBots > 50)\n{\n    // Limit bot population\n    botSpawner->DespawnBot(currentZone);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal tracking structures that
    maintain a count of active bots per zone. It may involve thread synchronization
    to ensure consistency when bots are spawned or despawned concurrently. The performance
    impact should be minimal as it typically involves a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: Ensure the zone ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid zone in
    the game world, otherwise the behavior is undefined. This method does not validate
    the zone ID internally, so callers should ensure validity before calling.
