documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotTalentManager class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotTalentManager
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access global bot talent management
    functionality, such as loading, caching, and applying talent configurations for
    AI-controlled characters. The returned pointer provides access to all public methods
    of the BotTalentManager for managing bot talents within the TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotTalentManager instance. The method will always
    return a valid pointer, as the singleton pattern ensures instantiation on first
    access.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotTalentManager singleton
    code: "BotTalentManager* talentManager = BotTalentManager::instance();\n// Use\
      \ the talent manager to load bot talents\nif (talentManager)\n{\n    talentManager->LoadBotTalents();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard singleton implementation practices. The instance
    is created lazily on first call, and subsequent calls return the same object.
    The BotTalentManager singleton should be initialized before use, typically during
    server startup or when bot systems are enabled.
