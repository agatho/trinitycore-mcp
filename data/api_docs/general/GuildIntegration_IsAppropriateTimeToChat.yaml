  class: GuildIntegration
  method: IsAppropriateTimeToChat
  signature: bool GuildIntegration::IsAppropriateTimeToChat(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether it is appropriate for a player to send a guild chat message
    based on time-based restrictions.
  description: The IsAppropriateTimeToChat method evaluates if a player is allowed
    to send a message in the guild chat channel. This check typically enforces cooldowns
    or time-based restrictions to prevent spamming or excessive messaging within the
    guild. The method may consider factors such as last sent message timestamp, global
    guild chat cooldowns, or player-specific timing rules. It returns true if the
    player can send a message, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining orderly communication in guild environments.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) or internal index. Used to retrieve player-specific timing data and apply
      individual cooldown rules.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is allowed to send a guild chat message
    at this time, false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that the player
    has recently sent a message or is under a temporary cooldown.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nif (guildIntegration->IsAppropriateTimeToChat(&playerId))\
      \ {\n    // Allow sending guild chat message\n    SendGuildMessage(\"Hello,\
      \ guild!\");\n} else {\n    // Do not send message due to cooldown\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Please wait before sending another guild message.\");\n}"

  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player state tracking and may
    be part of a larger system that manages chat rate limiting. Developers should
    ensure that the player parameter correctly points to valid player data to avoid
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the player pointer could lead to crashes or incorrect
    behavior. Ensure that the integer pointed to by 'player' represents a valid player
    GUID or index before calling this method.
