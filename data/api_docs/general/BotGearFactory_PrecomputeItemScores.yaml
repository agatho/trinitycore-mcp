documentation:
  brief: Precomputes item scores for bot gear optimization.
  description: The PrecomputeItemScores method calculates and caches item scores for
    all applicable items in the game database to optimize bot gear selection. This
    method is typically invoked during initialization or when item data is updated,
    ensuring that bots can quickly evaluate and select the most beneficial equipment
    based on precalculated values. The computed scores take into account various factors
    such as item stats, enchantments, gem bonuses, and character class requirements.
    This precomputation significantly improves performance during active bot gear
    evaluation by avoiding repeated calculations.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotGearFactory factory;

      factory.PrecomputeItemScores();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any significant changes to item data or
    when initializing the bot gear system. The precomputed scores are stored internally
    and reused during subsequent gear evaluations, making this a one-time expensive
    operation for performance gains.
