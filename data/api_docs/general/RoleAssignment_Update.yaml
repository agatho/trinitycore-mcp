documentation:
  brief: Updates the role assignment state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    current state of a role assignment within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    is typically called during the game loop to handle time-based updates, such as
    role expiration timers, cooldown management, or synchronization with other systems.
    It processes any pending changes or events related to the role assignment and
    ensures that the assignment remains consistent with the current game state. The
    method accepts a time delta parameter representing milliseconds since the last
    update call.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'RoleAssignment* roleAssign = new RoleAssignment();

      roleAssign->Update(50); // Update with 50ms elapsed time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain accurate
    role assignment states. It's designed to be non-blocking and efficient, typically
    performing minimal operations per call.
