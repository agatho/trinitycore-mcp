  brief: Loads role-based access control data from the database asynchronously
  description: The LoadFromDBCallback method is an asynchronous callback function
    used within TrinityCore's RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system to process and
    load permission data from the database. This method is typically invoked when
    a database query completes, allowing the system to retrieve and apply user permissions.
    It handles the result of a database operation that fetches RBAC-related information
    such as roles, permissions, and associated accounts. The method processes the
    retrieved data and updates internal RBAC structures accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Asynchronous RBAC Data Loading
    code: "void SomeClass::StartRBACLoad()\n{\n    // Initiate database query for\
      \ RBAC data\n    CharacterDatabase.AsyncQuery(\"SELECT * FROM rbac_account WHERE\
      \ account_id = %u\", accountId);\n}\n\n// Callback method implementation\nvoid\
      \ RBACData::LoadFromDBCallback(int result)\n{\n    if (result == 0) // Success\n\
      \    {\n        // Process loaded RBAC data\n        ApplyPermissions();\n \
      \   }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle database error\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to load RBAC data for account %u\", accountId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an asynchronous database operation flow. It should
    not be called directly but rather as a callback from the database query system.
    The method assumes that the database connection and query have already been properly
    set up. It's designed to work within TrinityCore's threading model for database
    operations.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly; it is intended to be invoked only by
    the internal database query system. Improper usage may lead to data corruption
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that all required database connections are established
    before initiating RBAC data loading operations.
