  class: InstanceScript

  signature: void InstanceScript::OnGameObjectRemove(GameObject * go)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a game object is removed from the instance, allowing custom logic
    to be executed.
  description: The OnGameObjectRemove method is a virtual callback function in the
    InstanceScript class that gets invoked whenever a GameObject is removed from the
    instance. This typically occurs when the object is destroyed, despawned, or otherwise
    no longer present in the world. Developers can override this method in their custom
    instance scripts to implement specific behaviors such as updating quest states,
    triggering events, or cleaning up references related to the removed game object.
    The method provides access to the GameObject pointer that was removed, enabling
    developers to query its properties and perform actions based on the object's type
    or state.
  parameters:
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the GameObject that has been removed from the instance.
      This parameter is never null when the method is called.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Example
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnGameObjectRemove(GameObject*\
      \ go) override\n    {\n        // Check if the removed object is a specific\
      \ type\n        if (go->GetEntry() == 12345)\n        {\n            // Perform\
      \ custom logic when this object is removed\n            sLog->outString(\"Custom\
      \ object removed from instance\");\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest State Update Example
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnGameObjectRemove(GameObject*\
      \ go) override\n    {\n        // If a quest-related object is removed, update\
      \ quest state\n        if (go->GetEntry() == 12346)\n        {\n           \
      \ // Mark quest as incomplete or trigger related events\n            for (auto&\
      \ player : GetPlayers())\n            {\n                if (player && player->GetQuestStatus(54321)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n                {\n                    player->SetQuestStatus(54321,\
      \ QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n   \
      \ }\n};"

  notes: This method is called during the GameObject's removal process, so any modifications
    to the GameObject itself should be handled carefully. The GameObject pointer remains
    valid only for the duration of this call and should not be stored for later use
    unless explicitly referenced elsewhere.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or delete the GameObject within this callback
    as it may already be in the process of being destroyed. Avoid performing heavy
    operations that could block the game loop, as this method is called synchronously
    during world updates.
