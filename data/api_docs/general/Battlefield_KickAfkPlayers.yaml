  brief: Kicks AFK players from the battlefield
  description: The KickAfkPlayers method removes all players who have been marked
    as Away From Keyboard (AFK) from the battlefield instance. This method is typically
    invoked during battlefield management to ensure that inactive players do not remain
    in active combat zones. It iterates through all players currently registered in
    the battlefield and identifies those with AFK status, then removes them from the
    battlefield environment. The operation helps maintain fair play by preventing
    AFK players from benefiting from or hindering active participants.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battlefield Update Loop
    code: "void Battlefield::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\
      \ ...\n    KickAfkPlayers();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks player AFK status using the Player::IsAFK() function
    and may involve removing players from the battlefield's internal player list.
    It should only be called during appropriate update cycles to avoid concurrent
    modification issues.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a controlled update context may cause undefined
    behavior or crashes due to potential race conditions with player state changes.
    Ensure that any player removal operations are thread-safe if used in multi-threaded
    contexts.
