documentation:
  brief: Invites all players within the battlefield zone to join the battlefield queue.
  description: The InvitePlayersInZoneToQueue method is responsible for identifying
    and inviting all eligible players currently located within the battlefield's defined
    zone to participate in the ongoing battlefield event. This method typically gets
    invoked during battlefield initialization or when a player enters the battlefield
    area, ensuring that nearby players are automatically added to the queue for participation.
    It handles the logic of determining which players are in range and not already
    queued, then sends appropriate invitation messages or updates their queue status.
    The method is crucial for maintaining active player engagement and ensuring that
    battlefield events can fill up quickly with interested participants.

    code: "void Battlefield::OnBattlefieldCreate()\n{\n    // Initialize battlefield\
      \ logic\n    InvitePlayersInZoneToQueue();\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on a per-zone basis and may have performance
    implications if many players are present in the area. It's typically called during
    battlefield state transitions or when new players enter the zone to ensure optimal
    queue population.
