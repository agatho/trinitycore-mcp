  class: GroupModel
  method: GetVertices
  signature: const int & GroupModel::GetVertices() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of vertices in the group model.
  description: The GetVertices method retrieves the total count of vertices that define
    the geometry of a GroupModel. This is typically used in the context of 3D mesh
    rendering and collision detection within the TrinityCore framework. The returned
    value represents how many individual points (vertices) make up the model's structure,
    which can be important for performance calculations, memory usage tracking, or
    when iterating through the model's components. This method does not modify any
    internal state and is safe to call multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the total number of vertices
    in the GroupModel. The value is always non-negative and corresponds to the vertex
    count of the underlying mesh data structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupModel* model = ...; // Assume this is initialized

      const int& vertexCount = model->GetVertices();

      std::cout << "Vertex count: " << vertexCount << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference to an internal integer member, so modifying
    the returned value will not affect the GroupModel's actual vertex count. The method
    is likely implemented as a simple getter that directly accesses a stored vertex
    count variable.
