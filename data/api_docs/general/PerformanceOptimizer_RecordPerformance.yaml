  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: RecordPerformance
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::RecordPerformance(uint32_t botGuid, const
    PerformanceSample & sample)
documentation:
  brief: Records a performance sample for a specific bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The RecordPerformance method is used to log performance metrics for
    a particular bot within the TrinityCore framework. This function takes a bot's
    unique identifier (GUID) and a performance sample object, which typically contains
    timing or resource usage data. The method likely stores this information for later
    analysis or optimization purposes, helping developers monitor and improve the
    efficiency of AI behaviors in the game environment. It is designed to be called
    during bot execution cycles to capture real-time performance characteristics.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the performance
      sample is being recorded. This value uniquely identifies a specific bot instance
      within the game world.
  - name: sample
    description: A PerformanceSample object containing performance metrics such as
      execution time, resource consumption, or other relevant timing data for the
      bot's current operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      PerformanceSample sample;

      sample.executionTimeMs = 50;

      sample.memoryUsageKB = 1024;

      performanceOptimizer.RecordPerformance(botGuid, sample);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring system. It
    may be called frequently during bot operation, so it should ideally have minimal
    overhead to avoid impacting gameplay performance. The actual storage mechanism
    for these samples might involve internal data structures or external logging systems.
