documentation:
  brief: Returns the battleground type ID for a specified Battle Master entry
  description: Retrieves the corresponding battleground type identifier (BGTypeID)
    for a given Battle Master entry ID. This method is used internally by the Battleground
    system to map Battle Masters (NPCs that allow players to queue for battlegrounds)
    to their respective battleground types. The method performs a lookup in the internal
    battleground template registry and returns the associated BGTypeID if found, or
    -1 if no matching battleground type exists for the provided entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the battleground type ID (BGTypeID) for
    the specified Battle Master entry. Returns -1 if no valid battleground type is
    found for the given entry.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int bgTypeId = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleMasterBG(3483);\nif (bgTypeId\
      \ != -1)\n{\n    // Valid battleground type found\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bg\", \"\
      Found battleground type %d for Battle Master entry 3483\", bgTypeId);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // No matching battleground type found\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"bg\", \"No\
      \ battleground type found for Battle Master entry 3483\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during player interaction with Battle Masters
    to determine which battleground they are attempting to queue for. The method assumes
    that the Battle Master entry ID corresponds to a valid NPC in the game database
    and that the corresponding battleground type has been properly registered in the
    BattlegroundMgr system.
