documentation:
  brief: Resets all spells for the player, clearing spell book and relearning all
    spells.
  description: The ResetSpells method clears all learned spells from the player's
    spell book and relearns all spells based on their class. This method is typically
    used during character level-up or when resetting a character's spell progression.
    The method can optionally restrict the reset to only the player's own class spells,
    preventing other class spells from being cleared. This action affects the player's
    spellbook and can be used to restore default spell learning behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: myClassOnly
    description: When set to true, only resets spells specific to the player's own
      class. When false, resets all spells including those from other classes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: player->ResetSpells(false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Class-specific reset example
    code: player->ResetSpells(true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically triggers a spellbook update and may require additional
    handling for proper synchronization with the client. The implementation involves
    clearing the player's spell book and relearning spells based on their class progression.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to loss of spell knowledge or incorrect
    spell learning behavior. It should only be used when necessary, such as during
    character level-up or when resetting a character's spell progression.
