  class: BattlegroundMap
  method: Update
  signature: void BattlegroundMap::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the battleground map state based on the elapsed game time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing all active battleground-related
    logic and state changes within the map. It handles timer-based events, player
    movement validation, score updates, and other dynamic elements that occur during
    a battleground match. This method is typically called by the core game loop at
    regular intervals to ensure the battleground remains synchronized with the current
    game time. The method processes all active battleground instances on the map,
    updating their internal states according to the time difference passed in the
    'diff' parameter.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "BattlegroundMap* bgMap = sObjectMgr->GetBattlegroundMap(1234);\nif (bgMap)\n\
      {\n    bgMap->Update(1000); // Update with 1 second elapsed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active battleground maps that are currently
    running a match. The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds since last update,
    which is typically provided by the core game loop. The method may perform various
    operations including player scoring, objective updates, and battleground state
    transitions.
  warnings: Calling this method on inactive or uninitialized battleground maps can
    result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the map is properly initialized and
    currently running a battleground before calling Update.
