  class: CooldownManager
  method: StartCategoryCooldown
  signature: void CooldownManager::StartCategoryCooldown(uint32 categoryId, uint32
    cooldownMs)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a category-based cooldown for the specified category ID with the
    given duration in milliseconds.
  description: The StartCategoryCooldown method activates a cooldown period for a
    specific category of abilities or items within the game. This mechanism is used
    to enforce cooldowns based on categories rather than individual spells or items,
    which allows for more flexible and balanced gameplay mechanics. When invoked,
    it sets the cooldown timer for the given categoryId to expire after cooldownMs
    milliseconds. The method does not return any value and operates directly on the
    internal cooldown tracking system of the CooldownManager instance.
  parameters:
  - name: categoryId
    description: The unique identifier representing a category of abilities or items
      that should be placed on cooldown. Categories are typically defined in game
      data files and represent groups of related spells or items such as 'Weapon Skills'
      or 'Spell Cooldowns'.
  - name: cooldownMs
    description: The duration of the cooldown in milliseconds. This value determines
      how long the category will remain on cooldown before it can be triggered again.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: cooldownManager->StartCategoryCooldown(1234, 5000); // Applies a 5-second
      cooldown to category 1234
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spell Trigger Context
    code: "if (player->HasSpellCooldown(spellId))\n{\n    // Handle cooldown logic\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Apply cooldown using category\n    cooldownManager->StartCategoryCooldown(categoryId,\
      \ cooldownDuration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the CooldownManager and
    should be called only when a category-based cooldown is required. It's important
    to note that this method does not check if a cooldown is already active for the
    given category; it simply starts a new one, potentially overriding any existing
    cooldown.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid categoryId may lead to undefined behavior
    or unexpected gameplay effects. Ensure that categoryId values are valid and correspond
    to actual categories defined in the game's data files. Additionally, calling StartCategoryCooldown
    repeatedly without proper cooldown management can result in excessive cooldowns
    being applied.
