  class: ArcaneChargeTracker
  method: IsMaxCharges
  signature: bool ArcaneChargeTracker::IsMaxCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the Arcane Charge Tracker has reached its maximum charge capacity.
  description: The IsMaxCharges method determines if the current arcane charge count
    for a player or unit has reached the maximum allowable charges. This is commonly
    used in spell systems where arcane effects build up charges over time or through
    specific actions, and certain abilities can only be cast when at maximum charges.
    The method typically compares the internal charge counter against a predefined
    maximum value set by the game mechanics or class-specific rules. It returns true
    if the current charges equal or exceed the maximum, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ArcaneChargeTracker has reached its maximum charge
    capacity; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (player->GetArcaneChargeTracker()->IsMaxCharges()) {\n    // Cast arcane\
      \ spell that requires full charges\n    player->CastSpell(target, ARCANE_BLAST_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Before Applying Charge Effects
    code: "ArcaneChargeTracker* tracker = player->GetArcaneChargeTracker();\nif (!tracker->IsMaxCharges())\
      \ {\n    tracker->AddCharge();\n    // Notify client of new charge\n    player->SendUpdateWorldState(ARCANE_CHARGE_WORLD_STATE,\
      \ tracker->GetCharges());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with other ArcaneChargeTracker functions
    such as GetCharges(), AddCharge(), and ResetCharges(). The maximum charge value
    may vary depending on the character's class, talents, or equipped items. This
    function is typically called during spell casting checks or before applying arcane
    effects that require full charges.
  warnings: Ensure that the ArcaneChargeTracker object is not null before calling
    this method to avoid runtime errors. In some cases, charge systems may have cooldowns
    or restrictions that prevent immediate recharging even after reaching maximum
    capacity.
