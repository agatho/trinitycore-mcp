  class: AuraApplication
  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: int AuraApplication::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves debug information integer value from the AuraApplication instance.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method returns an integer identifier used for debugging
    purposes within the AuraApplication class. This method is typically employed during
    development and debugging phases to retrieve internal state information about
    auras applied to units. The returned value may represent various internal flags,
    states, or identifiers depending on the implementation details of the aura system
    in TrinityCore. It's primarily intended for diagnostic use rather than gameplay
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing debug information about the aura application
    state. The specific meaning of this integer depends on internal implementation
    details and is mainly useful for debugging purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Info Retrieval
    code: "AuraApplication* auraApp = unit->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (auraApp)\n\
      {\n    int debugInfo = auraApp->GetDebugInfo();\n    // Use debugInfo for logging\
      \ or debugging purposes\n    sLog->outDebug(\"Aura debug info: %d\", debugInfo);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for internal debugging and should not be
    used in production gameplay code. The returned integer value may change between
    different TrinityCore versions or patches. It's recommended to use this method
    only when actively debugging aura-related issues.
  warnings: Using GetDebugInfo in performance-critical code paths may introduce unnecessary
    overhead. The value returned is not guaranteed to be stable across different TrinityCore
    builds and should never be used for gameplay logic decisions.
