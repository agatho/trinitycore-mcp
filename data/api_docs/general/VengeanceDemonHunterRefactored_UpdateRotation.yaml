  signature: void VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::UpdateRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Vengeance Demon Hunter's rotation logic based on current target
    and combat state
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for managing the core combat
    rotation behavior of a Vengeance Demon Hunter class in World of Warcraft. This
    method evaluates the current target, player resources, and combat conditions to
    determine the appropriate ability to cast next. It integrates with the TrinityCore
    AI system to make real-time decisions about spell selection, cooldown management,
    and tactical positioning. The method typically operates within the context of
    a combat encounter and adjusts the rotation based on target health percentages,
    available rage or fury, and active buffs/debuffs. This implementation ensures
    optimal damage output while maintaining proper resource management and cooldown
    tracking for the Vengeance specialization.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current combat target's ID
      or index. This parameter is used to determine targeting logic, threat assessment,
      and ability selection based on the target's current state and health percentage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic rotation update with target
    code: "void UpdateRotation(int* target)\n{\n    // Example implementation\n  \
      \  if (target && *target > 0)\n    {\n        // Process rotation logic based\
      \ on target\n        // Determine next ability to cast\n        // Manage cooldowns\
      \ and resource usage\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with TrinityCore AI system
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::UpdateRotation(int* target)\n{\n \
      \   if (!target || *target <= 0) return;\n    \n    Unit* targetUnit = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*target);\n\
      \    if (!targetUnit || !targetUnit->IsAlive()) return;\n    \n    // Update\
      \ rotation based on combat state\n    // This would typically involve:\n   \
      \ // - Checking current rage/fury levels\n    // - Evaluating target health\
      \ for ability selection\n    // - Managing cooldowns and resource efficiency\n\
      \    // - Implementing Vengeance-specific mechanics\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked directly in most cases. The target parameter must point to a valid
    combat target ID; otherwise, the method will return early without performing any
    rotation logic. Performance considerations include avoiding expensive operations
    within this method as it's called frequently during combat encounters.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null pointer or invalid target ID as it
    may cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid
    Unit object before calling this method, as the implementation assumes the target
    exists and is in combat state.
