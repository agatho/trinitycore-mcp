api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: ShouldUndercut
  signature: bool AuctionHouse::ShouldUndercut(int * player, uint32 itemId, uint32
    currentLowest)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an auction item should be undercut based on current market
    conditions and player settings.
  description: The ShouldUndercut method evaluates if a given auction item's price
    should be set below the current lowest bid to increase the chances of selling.
    This decision is typically made by the auction house system when considering optimal
    pricing strategies for players. The method takes into account various factors
    such as the item's market value, the player's configured undercut settings, and
    the current lowest auction price. It returns true if undercutting is recommended,
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for automated auction management
    systems within the game.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object associated with the auction. Used to
      access player-specific auction settings and preferences.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier for the item being evaluated for undercutting.
      Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: currentLowest
    description: The current lowest bid price for the item in the auction house. Used
      as the baseline for determining if undercutting is necessary.
  returns: Returns true if the item should be undercut based on current market conditions
    and player settings; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = session->GetPlayer();\nuint32 itemId = 12345;\nuint32\
      \ currentLowest = 10000;\nbool shouldUndercut = auctionHouse->ShouldUndercut(&player,\
      \ itemId, currentLowest);\nif (shouldUndercut)\n{\n    // Adjust auction price\
      \ to undercut current lowest bid\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with player-specific auction settings stored
    in the database. It may also consider factors like item rarity, market demand,
    and server-wide auction dynamics. The implementation might be part of a larger
    automated auction management system.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid segmentation faults. The currentLowest value should be validated to prevent
    invalid auction pricing strategies.
