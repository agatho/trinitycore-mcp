documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement speed of the unit for a specified movement type.
  description: The GetSpeed method retrieves the current movement speed of a Unit
    object for a given movement type. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to determine how fast a unit moves, whether it's walking,
    running, or swimming. The returned value represents the speed in yards per second
    and can be influenced by various factors such as buffs, debuffs, and movement
    modifiers. It is essential for calculating movement-related mechanics and determining
    unit behavior during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the speed in yards per second for the
    specified movement type. The value may be zero or negative if the unit is affected
    by movement restrictions or if the movement type is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float speed = unit->GetSpeed(MOVE_WALK);

      std::cout << "Walking speed: " << speed << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "UnitMoveType moveType = MOVE_RUN;\nfloat speed = unit->GetSpeed(moveType);\n\
      if (speed > 0)\n{\n    // Process movement speed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related functions
    to determine overall unit behavior. Performance considerations include checking
    for valid movement types and ensuring that the unit's state does not affect the
    result. This method is thread-safe as long as the Unit object is properly synchronized.
  warnings: Be aware that invalid movement types may return zero or negative values,
    which could lead to incorrect calculations if not handled properly. Also, ensure
    that the unit is in a valid state before calling this method to avoid unexpected
    results.
