  brief: Initializes spell positivity values for all spells in the database
  description: This method sets up the positive/negative spell classification for
    all spells within the TrinityCore database. It determines whether each spell is
    considered beneficial (positive) or harmful (negative based on its effects and
    mechanics. The initialization process involves examining spell attributes, effects,
    and interactions to properly classify spells according to game mechanics. This
    method is typically called during server startup or database loading phases to
    ensure proper spell handling.

  notes: This method should be called only once during initialization phase. It may
    affect performance if called frequently on large databases. Thread safety is not
    guaranteed.
  warnings: This method should not be called multiple times as it may cause duplicate
    initialization or memory issues. The method assumes all spell data is loaded before
    execution.
