documentation:
  brief: Destroys the packet pool manager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The PacketPoolManager destructor is responsible for cleaning up all
    memory and resources allocated by the packet pool manager. This includes freeing
    any cached packets, releasing internal data structures, and ensuring no memory
    leaks occur during the shutdown of the networking subsystem. The destructor is
    automatically invoked when a PacketPoolManager instance goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of the packet allocation system
    used by TrinityCore's network layer to efficiently manage game packets.

  - title: Automatic destruction of PacketPoolManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    PacketPoolManager manager;\n    // ... use\
      \ manager ...\n    // manager is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during server shutdown or when the networking subsystem is being torn down. Developers
    should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing custom memory management
    patterns.
