  class: BotScheduler
  method: IsBotActive
  signature: bool BotScheduler::IsBotActive(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a bot with the specified GUID is currently active in the scheduler.
  description: The IsBotActive method determines if a specific bot, identified by
    its unique global identifier (GUID), is currently active within the BotScheduler
    system. This function is typically used to verify the operational status of bots
    before performing actions that require them to be running. The method performs
    a lookup in the scheduler's internal data structures to check for the presence
    and active state of the bot. It does not modify any state but simply returns a
    boolean value indicating whether the bot is considered active at the time of the
    call.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot to check for activity
      status. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the bot's identification
      within the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: Returns true if the bot with the specified GUID is currently active in
    the scheduler; otherwise, returns false. An inactive bot may be stopped, pending,
    or not registered with the scheduler.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (botScheduler.IsBotActive(12345)) {\n    // Bot is active, perform actions\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Bot is currently active.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Bot is not active\n    std::cout << \"Bot is not active.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management
    code: "uint32 botGuid = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      if (botScheduler.IsBotActive(botGuid)) {\n    // Proceed with bot-specific operations\n\
      \    botScheduler.ExecuteBotCommand(botGuid, \"move to target\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Start the bot if it's not active\n    botScheduler.StartBot(botGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotScheduler maintains an internal collection
    or map of active bots. The performance of this lookup depends on the underlying
    data structure used (e.g., hash table, ordered list). For high-frequency checks,
    consider caching results or using a more efficient lookup mechanism if performance
    becomes an issue.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to a valid bot
    within the system. Passing an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in undefined
    behavior depending on how the internal data structures are implemented. Also note
    that this check is only as accurate as the current state of the scheduler at the
    time of invocation.
