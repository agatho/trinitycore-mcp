  method: UpdateProposal
  signature: void LFGMgr::UpdateProposal(uint32 proposalId, int guid, bool accept)
documentation:
  brief: Updates a LFG proposal with the acceptance status of a specific player.
  description: The UpdateProposal method handles the processing of a player's response
    to a Looking For Group (LFG) proposal. It updates the internal state of the proposal
    based on whether the player accepted or declined the group invitation. This method
    is typically called when a player interacts with a LFG proposal through the user
    interface, such as clicking accept or decline. The method manages the proposal
    lifecycle and ensures that the group composition is updated accordingly. It also
    handles cleanup of the proposal once all players have responded or when the proposal
    expires.
  parameters:
  - name: proposalId
    description: Unique identifier for the LFG proposal being updated. This ID corresponds
      to a specific group invitation that players can accept or decline.
  - name: guid
    description: Global Unique Identifier of the player who is responding to the proposal.
      This identifies which player's acceptance or rejection status is being updated.
  - name: accept
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player accepts (true) or declines
      (false) the LFG proposal. This determines the next steps in the group formation
      process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Accepting a LFG Proposal
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->UpdateProposal(12345, 67890, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Declining a LFG Proposal
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->UpdateProposal(12345, 67890, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and should only be called from within
    the context of player interactions with LFG proposals. The proposal ID must correspond
    to an existing active proposal in the system. This method may trigger further
    actions such as sending updated group information to players or cleaning up expired
    proposals.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid proposalId or guid can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the proposal exists and is still active before
    calling this method. The method assumes that all parameters are validated by the
    caller.
