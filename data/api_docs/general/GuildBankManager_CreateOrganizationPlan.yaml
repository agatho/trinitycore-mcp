documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new bank organization plan for the guild
  description: The CreateOrganizationPlan method initializes and returns a new BankOrganizationPlan
    object that defines the structure and permissions for a guild's bank organization.
    This method is typically used when setting up or resetting the guild bank's organizational
    hierarchy, including slot permissions, access levels, and storage configurations.
    The returned plan can be further modified to define specific rules for different
    guild ranks and members.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BankOrganizationPlan object representing the newly created organization
    structure for the guild bank. This object contains all necessary configuration
    data for managing guild bank slots and access permissions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BankOrganizationPlan plan = guildBankManager.CreateOrganizationPlan(nullptr);

      // Use the plan to configure guild bank permissions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely initializes default values for the organization plan and
    may interact with internal guild bank data structures. It should only be called
    when a new organization structure is needed, not repeatedly for the same guild.
