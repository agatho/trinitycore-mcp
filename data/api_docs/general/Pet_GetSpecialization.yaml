  method: GetSpecialization
  signature: uint16 Pet::GetSpecialization() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the specialization ID of the pet.
  description: The GetSpecialization method returns the unique specialization identifier
    for a pet, which determines its role and abilities within the game. This value
    corresponds to the pet's specialization as defined in the game's database or spell
    system. The returned value is typically used to identify the pet's specific build
    or talent configuration, especially for summoned creatures like hunter pets or
    warlock minions. This method does not require any parameters and will always return
    a valid uint16 value representing the specialization index.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value representing the pet's specialization ID. This ID maps to
    a specific specialization in the game's data tables, determining the pet's abilities
    and behavior. Returns 0 if the pet has no specialization assigned or if the specialization
    is not defined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint16 specId = pet->GetSpecialization();\nif (specId > 0)\n{\n    // Pet\
      \ has a valid specialization\n    printf(\"Pet specialization ID: %u\\n\", specId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Specific Specialization
    code: "uint16 petSpec = pet->GetSpecialization();\nif (petSpec == 257) // Example:\
      \ Beast Mastery specialization\n{\n    // Apply specific behavior for Beast\
      \ Mastery pets\n    pet->SetPower(POWER_FOCUS, 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for identifying pet builds in the context of
    hunter pets and warlock minions. The specialization ID returned corresponds to
    entries in the Spell.dbc or related database files that define pet abilities.
    For summoned pets, this value may be set during pet creation or through spell
    effects.
