documentation:
  brief: Activates the Arcane Power ability for the Mage AI, enhancing spell damage
    and critical strike chance.
  description: The UseArcanePower method is responsible for triggering the Arcane
    Power buff in the Mage AI system. This ability significantly increases the mage's
    spell damage and critical strike chance for a set duration. The method typically
    checks if the ability is available (not on cooldown) and then applies the appropriate
    buffs to the player's character. It may also handle the visual effects and animations
    associated with the activation of this powerful arcane ability. The AI will generally
    use this ability strategically during high-damage phases or when maximum spell
    power is needed.

  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_mage->GetPower(POWER_MANA) > 1000 && m_mage->CanCastSpell(SPELL_ARCANE_POWER))\n\
      \    {\n        UseArcanePower();\n    }\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the spell system to apply buffs and may
    require checking cooldowns, mana costs, and target conditions. The implementation
    should consider the current game state and player's resource availability before
    activation.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without checking prerequisites could result
    in invalid spell casting or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the AI has sufficient
    resources and that the ability is not on cooldown before calling this method.
