  brief: Moves a TerrainMgr object to another TerrainMgr instance, transferring ownership
    of its resources.
  description: The TerrainMgr move constructor transfers ownership of all resources
    from the source TerrainMgr object to the newly constructed object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where a TerrainMgr instance needs to be efficiently
    transferred between variables or containers without performing expensive deep
    copies. The source object becomes invalid after the move and should not be used.
    This constructor is part of the C++ standard library's move semantics and is commonly
    used in STL containers and smart pointer implementations within TrinityCore's
    terrain management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'TerrainMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... initialize sourceMgr ...

      TerrainMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Moves resources from sourceMgr
      to newMgr

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<TerrainMgr> terrainVector;

      TerrainMgr mgr1, mgr2;

      // ... initialize managers ...

      terrainVector.push_back(std::move(mgr1)); // Efficiently moves mgr1 into vector

      terrainVector.emplace_back(std::move(mgr2)); // Moves mgr2 directly into vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is implicitly defined when a class has no user-defined copy
    constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, or move assignment operator.
    The move constructor should only be called with an rvalue reference to ensure
    proper resource transfer. After moving, the source object's state is valid but
    unspecified and must not be accessed.
  warnings: Using the move constructor on an already moved-from object results in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the source object is not used after being moved
    from. This operation does not perform deep copying; it simply transfers pointers
    or handles to underlying resources.
