  class: BotProfiler
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotProfiler::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot profiler system and prepares it for tracking bot behavior
    metrics.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal structures and resources
    required for the BotProfiler to begin collecting performance data about AI-controlled
    bots in the game. This includes allocating memory, registering necessary callbacks,
    and ensuring all subsystems are ready to log profiling information. The method
    should be called once during server startup or when the profiler needs to be enabled.
    It performs basic validation to ensure that the profiler can operate correctly
    within the current environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if initialization was successful and all required components
    were properly set up; returns false if initialization failed due to missing dependencies,
    invalid configuration, or system resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "if (BotProfiler::Initialize()) {\n    // Profiler successfully initialized\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Bot profiler initialized successfully.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle initialization failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize\
      \ bot profiler.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when enabling profiling
    features dynamically. It's important that this method is not called multiple times
    without proper cleanup, as it may lead to resource leaks or inconsistent state.
  warnings: Calling Initialize more than once without prior shutdown can cause undefined
    behavior or memory corruption. Ensure that all bot-related systems are properly
    shut down before reinitializing the profiler.
