api:
  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: EnableAutoOptimization
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::EnableAutoOptimization(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic performance optimization within the game world.
  description: The EnableAutoOptimization method controls whether the PerformanceOptimizer
    class automatically applies performance enhancements to the game world. When enabled,
    this feature may dynamically adjust various system resources, such as AI behavior,
    object updates, and rendering settings, to maintain optimal performance. This
    method is typically used during server initialization or in response to changing
    server load conditions. The automatic optimization can help prevent performance
    degradation during high-traffic periods or when many players are active in the
    same area.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value that determines whether automatic optimization should
      be enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Automatic Optimization
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.EnableAutoOptimization(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Automatic Optimization
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.EnableAutoOptimization(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags or state variables within the
    PerformanceOptimizer class. It may be called during server startup, configuration
    changes, or in response to performance monitoring systems. The actual optimization
    strategies applied are not specified by this interface and would depend on the
    implementation details of the PerformanceOptimizer class.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to unexpected behavior if automatic
    optimizations are disabled during critical performance-sensitive operations. Ensure
    that any calls to this method are made at appropriate times, such as during server
    maintenance or when load is low.
