  method: ReduceAllCooldowns
  signature: void CooldownManager::ReduceAllCooldowns(uint32 reductionMs)
documentation:
  brief: Reduces all active cooldowns in the CooldownManager by the specified time
    amount.
  description: The ReduceAllCooldowns method decreases the remaining time of all active
    cooldowns managed by the CooldownManager by the provided millisecond value. This
    functionality is commonly used in World of Warcraft to implement effects such
    as cooldown reduction buffs, talents, or game mechanics that temporarily shorten
    spell or ability cooldowns. The method iterates through all registered cooldowns
    and adjusts their timers accordingly, ensuring that no cooldown is reduced below
    zero. This operation affects all cooldowns uniformly and does not distinguish
    between different types of abilities or spells.
  parameters:
  - name: reductionMs
    description: The amount of time in milliseconds to reduce all active cooldowns
      by. Must be a non-negative integer value representing the time reduction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic cooldown reduction usage
    code: 'CooldownManager* cm = player->GetCooldownManager();

      cm->ReduceAllCooldowns(5000); // Reduces all cooldowns by 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying cooldown reduction from a spell effect
    code: "void ApplyCooldownReduction(Player* player, uint32 reductionMs) {\n   \
      \ CooldownManager* cm = player->GetCooldownManager();\n    if (cm) {\n     \
      \   cm->ReduceAllCooldowns(reductionMs);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal cooldown timers directly and should be used
    carefully to avoid unintended side effects. It's typically called during game
    events or when applying buffs that modify cooldown behavior. The reduction is
    applied immediately to all active cooldowns without any validation checks for
    negative values.
  warnings: Be cautious when calling this method with large reduction values as it
    may cause cooldowns to expire unexpectedly. This can lead to gameplay inconsistencies
    if not properly controlled by game logic or conditions. Avoid calling this method
    during critical sections where cooldown states are being evaluated.
