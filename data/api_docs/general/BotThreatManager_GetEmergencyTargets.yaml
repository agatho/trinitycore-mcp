api:
  class: BotThreatManager
  method: GetEmergencyTargets
  signature: int BotThreatManager::GetEmergencyTargets()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of emergency targets currently in the bot's threat manager.
  description: The GetEmergencyTargets method returns the number of emergency targets
    that are currently being tracked by the BotThreatManager. These targets are typically
    those that pose an immediate threat to the bot or its group, such as enemies that
    have recently attacked the bot or are within a critical proximity. This count
    is used internally by the AI system to determine whether emergency actions should
    be taken, like switching targets or initiating defensive behaviors. The method
    does not modify any state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of emergency targets currently tracked
    by the threat manager. Returns 0 if no emergency targets are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int emergencyCount = botThreatManager->GetEmergencyTargets();\nif (emergencyCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Handle emergency situation\n    bot->SetTarget(nullptr);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making cycles to assess
    the current threat level. It's important to note that the returned value may change
    frequently as new threats are detected or existing ones are resolved.
