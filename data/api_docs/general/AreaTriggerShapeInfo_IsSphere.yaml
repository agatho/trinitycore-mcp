  class: AreaTriggerShapeInfo
  method: IsSphere
  signature: bool AreaTriggerShapeInfo::IsSphere() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the area trigger shape is a sphere.
  description: The IsSphere method checks if the current AreaTriggerShapeInfo instance
    represents a spherical area trigger shape. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    spell and effect system to determine how area effects are calculated and visualized.
    The method returns true if the shape type is specifically set to a sphere, and
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for proper spell targeting and
    collision detection in game mechanics involving circular area triggers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger shape is a sphere; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "AreaTriggerShapeInfo shape;\n// Assume shape has been initialized with\
      \ a spherical trigger\nif (shape.IsSphere()) {\n    // Handle sphere-specific\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"This is a spherical area trigger\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Effects
    code: "void ProcessAreaTrigger(AreaTriggerShapeInfo& shape) {\n    if (shape.IsSphere())\
      \ {\n        // Apply sphere-specific calculations for damage radius, etc.\n\
      \        float radius = shape.GetRadius();\n        // ... additional sphere\
      \ logic\n    } else {\n        // Handle other shapes like rectangles or cones\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other shape-related methods
    to determine the geometric properties of area triggers. The implementation likely
    relies on an internal enum or flag that defines the shape type, and this method
    simply checks if that flag corresponds to a sphere.
