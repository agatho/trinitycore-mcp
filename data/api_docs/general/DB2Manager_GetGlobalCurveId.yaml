  signature: uint32 DB2Manager::GetGlobalCurveId(GlobalCurve globalCurveType) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the global curve identifier associated with a specified global
    curve type.
  description: The GetGlobalCurveId method retrieves the unique identifier (ID) for
    a given global curve type from the database. This ID is used internally by TrinityCore
    to reference specific curve definitions that control various game mechanics such
    as experience gains, loot distribution, or spell scaling. The method takes a GlobalCurve
    enum value as input and returns the corresponding curve ID stored in the DB2 files.
    It's typically used during runtime when game systems need to apply curve-based
    calculations for dynamic values. This function assumes that the DB2Manager has
    been properly initialized with global curve data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the global curve identifier associated with
    the provided GlobalCurve type. If no valid mapping exists, it may return 0 or
    an undefined value depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Experience Curve ID
    code: uint32 expCurveId = sDB2Manager->GetGlobalCurveId(GlobalCurve::Experience);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on pre-loaded DB2 data structures. Ensure that the DB2Manager
    is initialized with global curve information before calling this function. The
    returned ID should be used directly in curve evaluation functions or lookups.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of DB2 data may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect curve IDs. Always validate that the GlobalCurve
    enum value passed is valid and supported by the game's current data files.
