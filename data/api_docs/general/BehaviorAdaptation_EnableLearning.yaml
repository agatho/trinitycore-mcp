  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: EnableLearning
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::EnableLearning(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables learning behavior for the BehaviorAdaptation instance.
  description: The EnableLearning method controls whether the BehaviorAdaptation instance
    will learn and adapt its behavior based on interactions or events. This functionality
    is typically used in AI systems to allow creatures or NPCs to modify their actions
    over time. When enabled, the behavior adaptation system will track relevant data
    and adjust future responses accordingly. The method does not validate the current
    state of the system before applying the change, so it should be called with appropriate
    context to ensure desired behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value that determines whether learning is enabled (true)
      or disabled (false). When true, the adaptation system begins tracking and learning
      from events. When false, learning is suspended but previously learned behaviors
      may still be applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Learning for NPC
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* npcBehavior = new BehaviorAdaptation();

      npcBehavior->EnableLearning(true); // Enable learning for this NPC behavior'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Learning After Training Period
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* adaptiveAI = GetCreature()->GetAI()->GetBehaviorAdaptation();

      adaptiveAI->EnableLearning(false); // Stop learning after training phase

      // AI will now use fixed behaviors without adaptation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the BehaviorAdaptation
    instance. It's recommended to call this method during initialization or transition
    points in an NPC's lifecycle rather than mid-combat to avoid unexpected behavior
    changes. The learning process may have performance implications if enabled for
    many creatures simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling EnableLearning(false) will not reset previously learned behaviors,
    only prevent further learning. If the system is re-enabled later, it may continue
    using accumulated knowledge from previous sessions. Ensure that disabling learning
    does not interfere with intended gameplay mechanics or quest progression.
