documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is a dungeon boss.
  description: This method checks if the creature instance represents a dungeon boss
    within the game world. It returns true if the creature is classified as a boss
    entity, typically found in dungeon instances such as those in the Burning Crusade
    or later expansions. The method is commonly used for identifying special encounters
    and determining whether a creature should be treated as a boss for gameplay mechanics
    purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is classified as a dungeon boss, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the creature is part of a boss encounter in a dungeon instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->IsDungeonBoss())\n{\n    // Handle boss-specific behavior\n\
      \    // For example, apply special AI or drop loot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal creature data classification and may not be
    available in all versions of TrinityCore. The implementation typically checks
    against specific creature flags or database entries that define boss status.
  warnings: This method should only be used when the creature instance is properly
    initialized and loaded. Using it on uninitiated creatures may cause undefined
    behavior or crashes.
