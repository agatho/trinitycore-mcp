  class: GroupIntegration
  method: OnLeaderChanged
  signature: void GroupIntegration::OnLeaderChanged(Group * group, Player * newLeader)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when the group leader is changed, updating internal state
    and notifying relevant systems.
  description: The OnLeaderChanged method is invoked whenever the leader of a group
    is updated in the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that all subsystems
    aware of group leadership are notified and can react accordingly. It typically
    updates internal tracking mechanisms, synchronizes permissions or roles within
    the group, and may trigger additional logic such as UI updates or quest state
    changes. The method does not return any value but modifies the group's internal
    state and potentially affects other systems that depend on group leadership.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose leader has changed. Must be a valid
      pointer to an existing group.
  - name: newLeader
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is now the new leader of the group.
      Must be a valid pointer to a player in the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom module
    code: "void MyGroupHandler::OnLeaderChanged(Group* group, Player* newLeader)\n\
      {\n    // Log the change\n    sLog->outString(\"Group %u leader changed to %s\"\
      , group->GetId(), newLeader->GetName().c_str());\n    \n    // Update custom\
      \ tracking data\n    m_groupLeaders[group->GetId()] = newLeader->GetGUID();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from internal TrinityCore systems when group
    leadership is altered, such as during player disconnection or explicit leader
    transfer. Developers should ensure that any custom logic in this method does not
    cause performance bottlenecks, especially if executed frequently. The method assumes
    valid inputs and does not perform null checks.
  warnings: Do not modify the group or player objects directly within this handler
    unless you are certain of the implications. Incorrectly modifying group state
    can lead to inconsistent behavior or crashes. Also, be cautious about calling
    blocking operations or functions that might cause deadlocks in this context.
