  signature: uint8 Player::GetInventorySlotCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of inventory slots available for the player.
  description: The GetInventorySlotCount method retrieves the total count of inventory
    slots that a player has access to. This includes all bag slots and backpack slots,
    but excludes the bank slots. The method is commonly used in game mechanics to
    determine how many items can be carried or to check if a player's inventory is
    full. It returns a uint8 value representing the number of slots available, which
    is essential for inventory management and item handling operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the total number of inventory slots
    available to the player. This value includes all bag slots and backpack slots
    but excludes bank slots. The returned value typically ranges from 0 to 160, depending
    on the player's level and class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint8 slotCount = player->GetInventorySlotCount();\nif (slotCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Player has inventory slots available\n    // Proceed with inventory\
      \ checks or item operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory-related
    methods such as GetInventorySlotCount() and GetBagSlotCount() to determine the
    total number of slots available. It's important to note that this value may vary
    depending on the player's level, class, and any applicable buffs or effects. The
    method is thread-safe and can be called from any context within the game engine.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining whether a player has space
    in their inventory for specific items, as it returns the total number of slots
    available rather than the number of free slots. For checking free slots, use GetInventorySlotCount()
    or similar methods with appropriate filtering.
