documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Unit object with world object status.
  description: This method initializes a Unit object by setting its world object status
    flag. It is typically used during object construction to ensure proper initialization
    of unit-based entities within the TrinityCore framework. The method ensures that
    the unit is correctly configured as either a world object or non-world object
    based on the provided parameter, affecting how the unit interacts with game mechanics
    and systems.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unit Initialization
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit(true);

      // Initializes unit as a world object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object construction and may be used
    internally by the TrinityCore framework to manage object state. It's important
    to note that this method does not directly affect the unit's behavior or properties
    but rather sets up its internal status.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect object initialization,
    potentially causing issues with game mechanics and object interactions. Ensure
    proper usage during object construction.
