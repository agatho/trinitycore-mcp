  class: DynamicObject
  method: BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask
  signature: void DynamicObject::BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask(int * data, const
    int & requestedObjectMask, const int & requestedDynamicObjectMask, const int *
    target) const
documentation:
  brief: Updates dynamic object data for a specific player based on provided masks
    and target.
  description: The BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask method constructs and populates
    update data for a DynamicObject instance, specifically tailored for a given player.
    It uses the provided object mask and dynamic object mask to determine which fields
    should be included in the update packet. The method is typically invoked during
    player interaction or visibility updates where only specific data fields need
    to be sent to a client. This function plays a crucial role in optimizing network
    traffic by sending only necessary information rather than full object states.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array that will store the constructed update
      values for the dynamic object.
  - name: requestedObjectMask
    description: An integer mask specifying which standard object fields should be
      included in the update packet.
  - name: requestedDynamicObjectMask
    description: An integer mask specifying which dynamic object-specific fields should
      be included in the update packet.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the target player or entity
      for whom the update is being prepared.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int updateData[UPDATE_FIELDS_COUNT];

      int objectMask = 0x01;

      int dynamicMask = 0x02;

      int targetPlayer[PLAYER_UPDATE_FIELDS_COUNT];


      // Assuming ''dynamicObj'' is a valid DynamicObject instance

      (dynamicObj)->BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask(updateData, objectMask, dynamicMask,
      targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the update system used in TrinityCore to efficiently
    send only relevant data to players. It's commonly called during visibility checks
    or when a player enters/leaves the range of a dynamic object.
