documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of another BotPacketRelay object to this instance
  description: The assignment operator for the BotPacketRelay class copies all data
    members from the source BotPacketRelay object to the current object. This method
    ensures that the destination object becomes an independent copy of the source,
    maintaining the same packet relay state and configuration. In the context of TrinityCore's
    bot system, this operation is typically used when reassigning packet handling
    behavior between different bot instances or when updating a bot's relay configuration
    during runtime. The implementation handles deep copying of internal data structures
    to prevent shared references that could lead to unexpected behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotPacketRelay object whose contents will be copied to
      this instance
  returns: A reference to the current BotPacketRelay object (this), allowing for chained
    assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Operation
    code: 'BotPacketRelay relay1;

      BotPacketRelay relay2;

      // Configure relay2...

      relay1 = relay2; // Assigns all contents from relay2 to relay1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotPacketRelay relay1, relay2, relay3;

      // Configure relays...

      relay1 = relay2 = relay3; // Chained assignment - all relays get contents of
      relay3'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a deep copy of the internal packet relay data structures.
    The implementation should handle potential memory allocation and deallocation
    properly to avoid memory leaks or dangling pointers. When used in multi-threaded
    environments, proper synchronization may be required if the BotPacketRelay objects
    are accessed concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the source object is in a valid state before assignment, as
    invalid data could lead to undefined behavior. Be cautious when assigning to objects
    that may have active packet processing threads, as this could interrupt ongoing
    operations.
