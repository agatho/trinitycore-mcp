  signature: void AuctionHouseMgr::UpdatePendingAuctions()
documentation:
  brief: Processes and updates the status of pending auctions in the auction house
    system.
  description: The UpdatePendingAuctions method is responsible for handling the internal
    logic that manages auctions which are currently pending completion or verification.
    This includes checking for expired auctions, processing bids, updating auction
    states, and ensuring proper cleanup of auction data. The method typically runs
    on a periodic basis as part of the game's maintenance loop to keep the auction
    house database synchronized with current game state. It ensures that all pending
    auction activities are properly resolved before the next update cycle begins.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateAuctionHouse()\n{\n    sAuctionHouseMgr->UpdatePendingAuctions();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the game's main update
    loop or through scheduled events. It may perform database operations and should
    be called from a thread-safe context to avoid race conditions with other auction-related
    operations.
  warnings: Calling this method manually outside of its intended update cycle may
    cause inconsistent auction states or duplicate processing. It should not be used
    for immediate auction actions but rather as part of the regular maintenance routine.
