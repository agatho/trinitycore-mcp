  class: Spell
  method: CheckScriptEffectImplicitTargets
  signature: bool Spell::CheckScriptEffectImplicitTargets(uint32 effIndex, uint32
    effIndexToCheck)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if script-defined implicit targets for a spell effect are correctly
    specified and meet requirements.
  description: The CheckScriptEffectImplicitTargets method verifies that the implicit
    target definitions for a given spell effect, as defined in the script (such as
    in SpellScript or SpellEffect), are valid and conform to expected criteria. This
    method is typically invoked during spell validation or execution phases to ensure
    that targets specified by scripts are properly resolved and do not violate game
    logic constraints. It checks whether the implicit targets of a spell effect match
    what is expected based on the spell's configuration and script behavior, helping
    maintain consistency in spell targeting mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: effIndex
    description: The index of the spell effect to validate. This corresponds to the
      effect number (0, 1, 2) within a spell's effect list.
  - name: effIndexToCheck
    description: The index of another spell effect that is used for comparison or
      validation purposes during target checking.
  returns: Returns true if the implicit targets defined for the specified spell effect
    are valid and meet all required conditions; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in SpellScript
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void Register()\
      \ override\n    {\n        OnEffectHit += SpellEffectFn(MySpellScript::OnEffectHitHandler,\
      \ EFFECT_0, SPELL_EFFECT_DUMMY);\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    void OnEffectHitHandler(SpellEffIndex\
      \ effIndex)\n    {\n        if (GetCaster()->ToPlayer() && !CheckScriptEffectImplicitTargets(effIndex,\
      \ 0))\n        {\n            // Handle invalid targets\n            return;\n\
      \        }\n        // Proceed with spell effect logic\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used within the context of custom spell scripts
    and should be called during spell effect handling to validate target definitions
    before proceeding. It relies on internal spell targeting logic and may interact
    with target selection systems in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes
    if targets are not properly validated, especially when working with dynamic or
    conditional spell effects.
