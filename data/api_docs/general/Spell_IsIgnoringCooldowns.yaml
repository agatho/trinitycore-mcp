  brief: Determines whether the spell ignores cooldown restrictions.

    restrictions, such as those with special abilities or effects that override standard
    game mechanics. The method is commonly used in conjunction with other cooldown-related
    functions to determine if a spell can be cast immediately without waiting for
    cooldown expiration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell ignores cooldowns, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the spell can be cast without waiting for cooldown restrictions to expire.
