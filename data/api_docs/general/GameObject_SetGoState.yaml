  class: GameObject
  method: SetGoState
  signature: void GameObject::SetGoState(int state)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the game object state to the specified value.
  description: The SetGoState method updates the current state of a GameObject, which
    determines how the object behaves in the world. This method is commonly used to
    control the activation or deactivation of game objects such as doors, chests,
    or other interactive elements. The state parameter typically represents one of
    several predefined states including 'active', 'inactive', or 'ready'. The method
    affects the object's visual appearance and interaction behavior within the game
    world.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: The new state value for the GameObject. Valid values are typically
      0 (inactive), 1 (active), or 2 (ready). This determines whether the object is
      currently usable or not.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetGoState(1); // Set to active state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with state checking
    code: "GameObject* go = GetGameObject();\nif (go->GetGoState() != 1)\n{\n    go->SetGoState(1);\n\
      }\n// Ensure object is active before interaction"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the GameObject's internal state variable. It
    should be used carefully as it can affect game mechanics and interactions with
    players. The method does not perform any validation checks on the input state
    value, so invalid values may cause unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Using this method without proper context can lead to incorrect object
    states that may break game mechanics or cause visual artifacts. Avoid calling
    this method during critical gameplay events such as player combat or quest progression.
