documentation:
  brief: Processes the ready check for group members in a World of Warcraft instance
  description: The ProcessReadyCheck method handles the logic for managing ready checks
    within a group, typically used during dungeon or raid instances to ensure all
    players are prepared before proceeding with objectives. It evaluates the status
    of each group member's readiness and updates the group coordinator's internal
    state accordingly. This method is called periodically by the game loop to maintain
    synchronization of player readiness states across the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    groupCoordinator->ProcessReadyCheck(1000);\
      \ // Process ready check every second\n    // ... rest of game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game update loop with a time
    delta parameter. The implementation likely tracks timeouts for player responses
    and may trigger group events when all members are ready or when timeout conditions
    are met.
