documentation:
  brief: Saves the account's mount collection to the database using the provided transaction.
  description: The SaveAccountMounts method persists the current state of a player's
    mount collection to the database. It utilizes an existing database transaction
    to ensure data consistency and atomicity during the save operation. This method
    is typically invoked when a player acquires new mounts or when the server shuts
    down to synchronize mount data with the persistent storage. The method does not
    return any value, as its purpose is purely to perform the save operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = sWorld->GetCollectionMgr();

      Transaction* trans = new Transaction();

      collectionMgr->SaveAccountMounts(trans);

      delete trans;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a valid database transaction is passed as a parameter.
    The transaction must be properly initialized and committed or rolled back by the
    caller to maintain data integrity.
