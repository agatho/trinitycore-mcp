  signature: void InstanceCoordination::HandleInstanceMechanics(Group * group, const
    std::string & mechanic)
documentation:
  brief: Processes instance mechanics for a group based on the specified mechanic
    type.
  description: The HandleInstanceMechanics method in the InstanceCoordination class
    is responsible for managing and applying various instance-related game mechanics
    to a given group. This method likely coordinates group-specific behaviors, such
    as instance locking, respawn handling, or other mechanics that affect how players
    interact within a dungeon or raid instance. It takes a pointer to a Group object
    and a string representing the mechanic type to be applied. The method is typically
    invoked during instance entry, exit, or specific event triggers to ensure proper
    group synchronization and game state management.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which instance mechanics are to be
      handled. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid group
      within the game world.
  - name: mechanic
    description: String identifier specifying the type of instance mechanic to process.
      Valid values may include 'enter', 'exit', 'respawn', or other instance-specific
      mechanics depending on implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Instance Entry
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->HandleInstanceMechanics(playerGroup,\
      \ \"enter\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Instance Respawn Mechanics
    code: "Group* raidGroup = raidInstance->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->HandleInstanceMechanics(raidGroup,\
      \ \"respawn\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages group-based instance
    behavior and should be called with proper synchronization to avoid race conditions.
    The mechanic parameter string may be validated against a predefined set of known
    mechanics for safety.
  warnings: Ensure the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as passing
    a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The mechanic string
    should be properly sanitized if it comes from external sources to prevent unexpected
    behavior.
