  method: ClearTaxiPath
  signature: void BGData::ClearTaxiPath()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the taxi path data associated with the battleground.
  description: The ClearTaxiPath method removes all taxi path information from the
    battleground data structure. This is typically used during battleground initialization
    or cleanup to ensure that no stale or leftover taxi path data persists between
    matches. The method resets internal state related to player movement paths, particularly
    those involving flight paths (taxi nodes) that may have been set during previous
    battleground sessions. It's an essential part of maintaining clean state for new
    battleground instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing taxi path before battleground start
    code: "void BattleGround::StartBattleground()\n{\n    // ... other initialization\
      \ code ...\n    bgData.ClearTaxiPath();\n    // ... continue with battleground\
      \ setup ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely resets internal data structures that track player movement
    paths, particularly those involving taxi nodes. It should be called during battleground
    reset or initialization phases to prevent cross-contamination of path data between
    different battleground instances.
