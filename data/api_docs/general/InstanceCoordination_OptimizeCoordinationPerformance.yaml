  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: OptimizeCoordinationPerformance
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::OptimizeCoordinationPerformance(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes instance coordination performance for a given group by adjusting
    internal data structures and synchronization mechanisms.
  description: 'The OptimizeCoordinationPerformance method is designed to enhance
    the efficiency of instance coordination within TrinityCore''s group management
    system. This method modifies internal state tracking and synchronization primitives
    to reduce overhead when managing group members in shared instances. It typically
    gets invoked during group formation, member changes, or instance transitions to
    ensure optimal performance. The method operates on a provided Group object and
    adjusts its coordination settings based on current group composition and instance
    requirements. Precondition: The input Group pointer must be valid and not null.
    Postcondition: The group''s internal coordination state is updated for improved
    performance.'
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose coordination performance will be
      optimized. Must be a valid, non-null Group instance representing an active group
      in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    InstanceCoordination::OptimizeCoordinationPerformance(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Instance Transition
    code: "void OnInstanceTransition(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group && group->IsInInstance())\n    {\n        InstanceCoordination::OptimizeCoordinationPerformance(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform internal locking operations that could impact performance
    if called excessively in tight loops. It's recommended to call this method only
    when group composition or instance state changes significantly, rather than on
    every game tick.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null Group pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Always validate the Group pointer before invoking this method.
