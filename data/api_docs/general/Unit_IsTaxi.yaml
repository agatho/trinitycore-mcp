documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently using a taxi service for travel.
  description: The IsTaxi method checks if a Unit (such as a player or creature) is
    currently utilizing a taxi system for transportation. This method is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to identify when a unit is in
    the middle of a taxi journey, which typically occurs during flight path transitions.
    The method returns true when the unit is actively engaged in taxi travel and false
    otherwise. This functionality is essential for managing player movement and ensuring
    proper handling of flight paths within the game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently using a taxi service, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the unit is in the middle of a flight path or taxi travel.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsTaxi()) {\n    // Player is currently on a taxi\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the TrinityCore framework.
    It may not reflect the actual physical state of the unit if the unit is in a state
    where it's not actively using a taxi but still has flight path data associated
    with it. Performance considerations are minimal as this method simply checks a
    flag.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine whether a unit is currently
    flying, as it only indicates taxi usage and not necessarily active flight status.
    Be cautious when using this in conjunction with other movement-related methods
    to avoid incorrect assumptions about the unit's state.
