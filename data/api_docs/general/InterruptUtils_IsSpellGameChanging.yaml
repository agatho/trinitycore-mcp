documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell interrupts gameplay mechanics or alters game state
  description: The IsSpellGameChanging method evaluates whether a given spell ID represents
    a spell that modifies core gameplay mechanics or alters the game state in a significant
    way. This typically includes spells that interrupt ongoing actions, change player
    conditions, or modify fundamental game systems. The method is used internally
    by TrinityCore to determine how spells should be handled during combat and gameplay
    events, particularly when considering spell interruption rules, aura management,
    and game state transitions. It helps identify spells that may require special
    handling in terms of priority, stacking, or interaction with other game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell ID represents a game-changing spell
    that alters core gameplay mechanics or state; returns false otherwise. The method
    evaluates spell properties to determine if the spell has significant impact on
    gameplay flow or player conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a spell is game-changing
    code: "if (InterruptUtils::IsSpellGameChanging(12345)) {\n    // Handle special\
      \ game-changing spell logic\n    printf(\"This spell changes the game state\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell data tables or configuration
    files that define which spells are considered 'game-changing'. The implementation
    may cache results for performance optimization. Developers should be aware that
    this method is primarily used in core game logic and may not be suitable for general
    spell categorization outside of TrinityCore's internal systems.
  warnings: This method should only be called with valid spell IDs that exist in the
    game database. Using invalid spell IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    evaluations. The method assumes all spell data is properly loaded and initialized
    before being called.
