  class: BotLifecycleMgr
  method: BotLifecycleMgr
  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::BotLifecycleMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotLifecycleMgr class for managing bot
    creation, destruction, and lifecycle events within the TrinityCore server.
  description: The BotLifecycleMgr constructor initializes internal data structures
    and registers necessary event handlers for bot lifecycle management. This includes
    setting up callbacks for player login/logout events, handling bot creation upon
    player entry into the game, and preparing systems to track and manage bot behavior,
    including automatic cleanup when players disconnect or bots are removed from the
    world. The class is designed to integrate seamlessly with TrinityCore's core systems
    to ensure proper initialization and resource management of AI-controlled characters
    (bots).

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BotLifecycleMgr instance
    code: 'BotLifecycleMgr* mgr = new BotLifecycleMgr();

      // The constructor automatically initializes all required systems for bot lifecycle
      management.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during server startup or when initializing
    the bot subsystem. It does not perform any immediate actions but sets up internal
    state and event handlers that will be triggered later by game events such as player
    login or logout.
