  method: GetNeededMaterials
  signature: int FarmingCoordinator::GetNeededMaterials(int * player, ProfessionType
    profession) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total quantity of materials needed for a specified profession.
  description: The GetNeededMaterials method calculates and returns the cumulative
    amount of resources required for a given player's profession. This function is
    typically used in crafting systems to determine what materials need to be gathered
    or purchased before a player can begin crafting items. The method takes into account
    the player's current profession level, the specific profession type, and any active
    crafting recipes or projects that may affect material requirements. It does not
    modify any internal state but instead provides read-only access to calculated
    material needs.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is used to identify which player's profession data should
      be queried for material requirements.
  - name: profession
    description: An enumeration value of type ProfessionType that specifies the particular
      profession for which material needs are being calculated. Valid values include
      various crafting professions such as Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, Alchemy,
      etc.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the total number of materials needed for
    the specified profession. A return value of zero indicates no materials are currently
    required, while negative values may indicate an error condition or invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerGUID = 12345;

      ProfessionType prof = PROFESSION_BLACKSMITHING;

      int neededMaterials = coordinator.GetNeededMaterials(&playerGUID, prof);

      printf("Materials needed: %d\n", neededMaterials);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "int playerGUID = 0;\nProfessionType prof = PROFESSION_NONE;\nint result\
      \ = coordinator.GetNeededMaterials(&playerGUID, prof);\nif (result < 0) {\n\
      \    printf(\"Error retrieving material requirements\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      Total materials needed: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player's profession data is already loaded and
    valid within the FarmingCoordinator instance. It may perform internal lookups
    or calculations based on the player's current crafting queue, pending projects,
    or inventory status. The method should be called only when the player has an active
    profession assigned.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the player parameter will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the ProfessionType passed is valid
    and corresponds to a known profession within the game's system. The returned value
    may not reflect real-time changes if the underlying profession data has not been
    updated recently.
