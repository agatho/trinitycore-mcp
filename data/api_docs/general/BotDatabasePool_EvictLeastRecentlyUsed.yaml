documentation:
  brief: Removes the least recently used database connections from the bot database
    connection pool.
  description: The EvictLeastRecentlyUsed method is responsible for managing the lifecycle
    of database connections within the BotDatabasePool. It identifies and removes
    the oldest or least frequently accessed connections from the pool, ensuring that
    the pool maintains an optimal number of active connections while preventing resource
    exhaustion. This mechanism helps in maintaining performance by periodically cleaning
    up stale connections that may have been idle for extended periods. The method
    operates on a FIFO (First In, First Out) or LRU (Least Recently Used) basis depending
    on the internal implementation of the connection pool.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotDatabasePool::instance().EvictLeastRecentlyUsed();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the system to maintain connection
    pool health. It's important to note that evicted connections are not immediately
    closed but rather marked for reuse or cleanup, depending on the pool's implementation
    strategy.
