  class: HealerPositioning
  method: CalculateHealerPosition
  signature: int HealerPositioning::CalculateHealerPosition(Group * group, Unit *
    combatTarget, const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal healer position within a group based on
    combat target and context.
  description: The CalculateHealerPosition method determines the best positioning
    for a healer unit within a group during combat. It evaluates the current combat
    situation, including the group's composition, the healer's abilities, and the
    proximity of the combat target to recommend an optimal position that maximizes
    healing efficiency and safety. This method considers factors such as threat levels,
    line of sight, and distance from the combat target. The result is a numeric identifier
    representing the calculated position within the group formation. The method requires
    a valid group and combat target to function properly.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the healer and other group
      members. Must be a valid, non-null pointer.
  - name: combatTarget
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      Must be a valid, non-null pointer.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to a CombatPositionContext structure containing contextual
      information about the current combat state, such as threat levels, positioning
      constraints, and environmental factors.
  returns: An integer value representing the calculated healer position within the
    group. A positive value indicates a valid position index; zero or negative values
    may indicate an error or invalid calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CalculateHealerPosition
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nUnit* target = player->GetVictim();\n\
      CombatPositionContext context;\ncontext.threatLevel = 100;\nint position = healerPositioning.CalculateHealerPosition(group,\
      \ target, context);\nif (position > 0) {\n    // Use the calculated position\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with error handling
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nUnit* target = player->GetVictim();\n\
      if (!group || !target) {\n    return -1; // Invalid input\n}\nCombatPositionContext\
      \ context;\ncontext.threatLevel = GetThreatLevel(target);\ncontext.isInMeleeRange\
      \ = IsWithinMeleeRange(player, target);\nint position = healerPositioning.CalculateHealerPosition(group,\
      \ target, context);\nif (position <= 0) {\n    // Handle error case\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to calculate healer position\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed with positioning\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI-driven positioning systems for healers
    in group-based combat scenarios. The calculation may involve complex pathfinding
    and threat assessment algorithms to ensure the healer's safety while maintaining
    optimal healing coverage.
  warnings: Ensure that both the Group and Unit parameters are valid before calling
    this method, as passing null pointers will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. The CombatPositionContext must be properly initialized with relevant
    combat data for accurate results.
