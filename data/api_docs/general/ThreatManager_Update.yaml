  class: ThreatManager
  method: Update
  signature: void ThreatManager::Update(uint32 tdiff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat manager with the current time delta to maintain accurate
    threat tracking.
  description: The Update method in ThreatManager class is responsible for processing
    and updating threat values based on the time elapsed since the last update. This
    method ensures that threat levels are properly maintained and adjusted according
    to game mechanics, particularly in relation to combat behavior and NPC targeting.
    It typically handles the calculation of threat changes over time, ensuring that
    the threat manager accurately reflects the current state of the creature's target.
    The method is called regularly during combat to maintain consistent threat tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: tdiff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This parameter
      represents the elapsed time between updates and is crucial for calculating proper
      threat adjustments based on game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'ThreatManager* threatMgr = new ThreatManager;

      threatMgr->Update(100);

      // Updates threat with 100ms time delta'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat update example
    code: "void UpdateThreat()\n{\n    uint32 tdiff = GetMSTime();\n    threatManager->Update(tdiff);\n\
      }\n// Updates threat manager with current time delta"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates and should be thread-safe.
    Performance considerations include the need for efficient time calculations to
    avoid lagging updates. Implementation details include handling of threat decay
    and adjustment calculations based on time delta.
  warnings: Care must be taken when calling this method in combat situations as improper
    timing can lead to inaccurate threat tracking. The method should not be called
    with invalid time values that could cause calculation errors.
