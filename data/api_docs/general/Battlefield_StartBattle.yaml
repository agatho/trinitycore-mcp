documentation:
  brief: Initiates a battlefield battle by transitioning the battlefield into its
    active combat state.
  description: The StartBattle method is responsible for beginning the active combat
    phase of a Battlefield instance. This method typically transitions the battlefield
    from a pre-battle state to an active battle state, initializing all necessary
    game objects, spawning NPCs, and starting the battle timer or countdown. It ensures
    that all players within the battlefield are properly registered for combat, and
    that the battlefield's objectives and rules are enforced. The method is usually
    invoked internally by the game system when the conditions for battle commencement
    are met, such as after a waiting period or when sufficient players have joined.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceID(instanceId);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    bf->StartBattle();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the battlefield is in a valid pre-battle
    state. It is not intended to be called directly by external systems or scripts
    without proper validation.
  warnings: Calling StartBattle on an already active battlefield may result in undefined
    behavior or game state corruption. Always verify the battlefield's current state
    before invoking this method.
