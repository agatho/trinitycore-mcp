  method: GetRequiredReagents
  signature: int NPCInteractionManager::GetRequiredReagents() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of required reagents for an NPC interaction.
  description: The GetRequiredReagents method returns the count of items that are
    required as reagents for performing a specific NPC interaction, such as crafting
    or quest completion. This value is typically used to determine if a player has
    provided sufficient resources before allowing the interaction to proceed. The
    method does not validate whether the player actually possesses these reagents;
    it only retrieves the configured requirement count from the NPC's interaction
    data. This is commonly used in conjunction with other methods like GetRequiredReagentItem()
    or ValidatePlayerReagents().
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of required reagents for the current
    NPC interaction. Returns zero if no reagents are required.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check reagent requirements
    code: "int requiredReagents = npcInteractionManager.GetRequiredReagents();\nif\
      \ (requiredReagents > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with reagent validation logic\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Player must provide \" << requiredReagents << \" reagents.\"\
      ;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using reagent count in crafting interaction
    code: "void ProcessCraftingInteraction(NPCInteractionManager& manager)\n{\n  \
      \  int reagentCount = manager.GetRequiredReagents();\n    if (reagentCount >\
      \ 0)\n    {\n        // Validate player inventory for required items\n     \
      \   for (int i = 0; i < reagentCount; ++i)\n        {\n            uint32 itemId\
      \ = manager.GetRequiredReagentItem(i);\n            int itemCount = manager.GetRequiredReagentCount(i);\n\
      \            // Check if player has sufficient items\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the NPC interaction data has been properly initialized
    and loaded. It is typically called during interaction setup or validation phases.
    The returned value may be zero if no reagents are required for the specific interaction
    type.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called after the NPC interaction state
    has been correctly set up. Calling it before initialization may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect values.
