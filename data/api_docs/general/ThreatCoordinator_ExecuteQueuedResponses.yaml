  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::ExecuteQueuedResponses()
documentation:
  brief: Processes all queued threat responses in the ThreatCoordinator.
  description: The ExecuteQueuedResponses method is responsible for executing all
    threat-related actions that have been added to the coordinator's queue. This method
    ensures that threat updates, combat state changes, and AI behavior modifications
    are properly handled in the correct order. It typically runs during the game loop
    to maintain consistent threat management across all engaged creatures and players.
    The method processes responses sequentially without blocking other systems, ensuring
    smooth gameplay performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    threatCoordinator.ExecuteQueuedResponses();\n\
      \    // ... continue with rest of loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom threat handling. The method
    operates on a thread-safe queue, but performance may degrade if too many responses
    are queued simultaneously.
