  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateReputationRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateReputationRequirements(uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a player meets the reputation requirements for a specified quest.
  description: The ValidateReputationRequirements method checks whether the given
    player has sufficient reputation with factions required to start or complete a
    specific quest. It evaluates the player's current standing with each faction listed
    in the quest's reputation requirements and returns true if all conditions are
    met, otherwise false. This validation is typically used during quest acceptance
    or completion to ensure players meet prerequisites before proceeding. The method
    accesses the quest database entry for the specified questId and compares it against
    the player's current reputation values stored in their character data.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate reputation requirements
      for. Must correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose reputation
      is being validated against the quest requirements. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player has sufficient reputation with all required
    factions, false otherwise. If the quest does not have any reputation requirements,
    the method will return true by default.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateReputationRequirements(12345, player)) {\n\
      \    // Player meets all reputation requirements\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You meet the reputation requirements.\");\n} else {\n    // Player does not\
      \ meet reputation requirements\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"You do\
      \ not meet the required reputation.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateReputationRequirements(quest->GetQuestId(),\
      \ player)) {\n        player->SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REPUTATION);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest acceptance logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest database and player reputation data
    structures. It assumes that the player's reputation values are up-to-date and
    synchronized with the server state. Performance is generally low impact as it
    performs simple comparisons against cached faction standings.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter corresponds to an actual existing quest
    in the database, otherwise behavior may be undefined. The method does not handle
    cases where a player's reputation data might be corrupted or out of sync with
    the server state.
