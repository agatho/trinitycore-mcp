  signature: ScriptMgr & ScriptMgr::operator=(ScriptMgr && right)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of a right-hand ScriptMgr object to this ScriptMgr instance.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on the ScriptMgr
    class, transferring all resources and state from the right-hand ScriptMgr object
    to the current object. This is a standard C++ move semantics implementation that
    efficiently transfers ownership of dynamically allocated data without deep copying.
    The method is typically used when assigning one ScriptMgr instance to another,
    particularly in scenarios involving temporary objects or std::move operations.
    After the move, the right-hand object should be left in a valid but unspecified
    state, and the current object will contain all the original data from the right-hand
    side.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current ScriptMgr object (this) after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'ScriptMgr&& tempMgr = ScriptMgr();

      ScriptMgr mainMgr;

      mainMgr = std::move(tempMgr); // Move assignment

      // tempMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment with Function Return
    code: "ScriptMgr createManager() {\n    return ScriptMgr(); // Return by value\
      \ triggers move\n}\n\nScriptMgr mgr = createManager(); // Move assignment from\
      \ temporary"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation for ScriptMgr.
    It should only be called on objects that are about to be destroyed or reassigned.
    The move operation is typically more efficient than copy operations as it transfers
    ownership rather than copying data. This method is implicitly called when using
    std::move() or when returning objects by value from functions.
  warnings: Calling this operator on an already moved-from object may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the right-hand operand is not used after a move assignment
    operation. Be cautious with smart pointers and references that might be invalidated
    during the move.
