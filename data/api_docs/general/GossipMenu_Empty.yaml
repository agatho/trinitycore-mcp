  class: GossipMenu
  method: Empty
  signature: bool GossipMenu::Empty() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the gossip menu contains any options or entries.
  description: The Empty() method determines if the GossipMenu object currently has
    no selectable options or entries available for display to a player. This is typically
    used before displaying a gossip menu to ensure that it's not empty, which could
    happen if all options have been removed or if the menu was just initialized. The
    method returns true when the menu contains zero entries and false otherwise. In
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this check is essential for preventing
    empty gossip windows from appearing to players, which would be an undesirable
    user experience.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the gossip menu contains no options or entries; returns
    false if the menu has one or more entries.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Gossip Menu is Empty Before Displaying
    code: "if (!player->GetGossipMenu().Empty())\n{\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->SendGossipMenu(12345,\
      \ player->GetGUID());\n}\nelse\n{\n    player->SendNoMoreGossip();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple check on the internal count of menu entries
    and is therefore very fast. It should be used before calling SendGossipMenu()
    to avoid displaying empty menus to players.
