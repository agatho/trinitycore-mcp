  class: BotScheduler
  method: CalculateNextLogin
  signature: int BotScheduler::CalculateNextLogin(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the next login time for a bot given its GUID.
  description: The CalculateNextLogin method determines when a bot should next log
    in based on its unique identifier (GUID). This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore bot system to manage bot scheduling and ensure proper login timing
    for automated gameplay. The calculation may consider factors such as bot configuration
    settings, server load, or specific scheduling rules defined for the bot type.
    It returns an integer representing the next login time in seconds since epoch.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to calculate the
      next login time. This value must be a valid, non-zero GUID associated with an
      existing bot in the system.
  returns: An integer representing the Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) when the
    bot should next log in. Returns -1 if the bot is not found or if there's an error
    during calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CalculateNextLogin
    code: "int nextLoginTime = scheduler.CalculateNextLogin(12345);\nif (nextLoginTime\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Next login time: \" << nextLoginTime << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"Failed to calculate next login time.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot scheduling system and relies on internal bot
    configuration data. The returned timestamp should be used in conjunction with
    time management functions to schedule actual login events. Ensure that the GUID
    passed corresponds to an active bot to avoid invalid results.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in a return value of
    -1, which should be handled appropriately by calling code. The method does not
    perform any validation on the GUID itself beyond checking for zero values.
