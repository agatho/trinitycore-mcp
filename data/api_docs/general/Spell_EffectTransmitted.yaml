  brief: Transmits spell effects to target players in World of Warcraft.
  description: The EffectTransmitted method handles the transmission of spell effects
    from a caster to target players, typically used in scenarios where a spell's impact
    needs to be applied to multiple targets or when dealing with specific game mechanics
    like area-of-effect spells. This method ensures proper handling of spell transmission
    and can be crucial for implementing various spell behaviors including direct damage,
    healing, or debuff applications. It is commonly invoked during spell processing
    and may involve complex interactions with target selection, aura application,
    and combat system mechanics.

    code: "void Spell::EffectTransmitted()\n{\n    // Implementation details\n   \
      \ // This method typically handles spell transmission to targets\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex interaction with the target selection
    system and may require careful handling of spell effects. Performance considerations
    include ensuring proper targeting and avoiding unnecessary computations during
    spell transmission.
  warnings: Improper implementation could lead to incorrect spell application, missing
    targets, or unexpected behavior in combat systems. This method should be carefully
    tested in various scenarios involving different spell types.
