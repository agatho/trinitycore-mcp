documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes mail level reward data from the database into memory
    for use during gameplay.
  description: The LoadMailLevelRewards method is responsible for retrieving all mail
    level reward entries from the database and loading them into internal data structures
    within the ObjectMgr class. These rewards are typically associated with character
    progression and may include items, gold, or other in-game currency that players
    can receive based on their level. The method ensures that these rewards are available
    for distribution when players meet specific level requirements through mail system
    interactions. This method is usually invoked during server startup or database
    reload operations to ensure the latest reward data is loaded.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadMailLevelRewards();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    processes. It's important to note that the data loaded by this method directly
    affects the mail system's functionality and should be executed after the database
    connection is established but before any gameplay begins.
