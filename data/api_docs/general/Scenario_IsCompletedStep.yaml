documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific scenario step has been completed by the player
  description: The IsCompletedStep method determines if a given scenario step has
    been marked as completed for the current player's scenario progress. This method
    is typically used within scenario logic to check the status of individual steps
    and control progression through the scenario. The method evaluates the internal
    state of the scenario tracking system and returns true if the specified step has
    been completed, or false otherwise. It relies on the player's scenario completion
    data stored in the database or in-memory structures.
  parameters:
  - name: step
    description: Pointer to a ScenarioStepEntry structure that defines the step to
      check for completion. This parameter must not be null and should reference a
      valid scenario step entry from the game's scenario step database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified scenario step has been completed by the player,
    false otherwise. If the input step pointer is null or invalid, behavior is undefined
    and may result in a crash or incorrect return value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a scenario step is complete
    code: "if (scenario->IsCompletedStep(stepEntry))\n{\n    // Handle the case where\
      \ the step is already completed\n    SendChatMessage(\"This step has already\
      \ been completed.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsCompletedStep in scenario progression logic
    code: "void Scenario::ProcessStepCompletion(ScenarioStepEntry* currentStep)\n\
      {\n    if (!IsCompletedStep(currentStep))\n    {\n        CompleteStep(currentStep);\n\
      \        if (IsCompletedStep(GetNextStep(currentStep)))\n        {\n       \
      \     // Proceed to next step\n            AdvanceToNextStep();\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the scenario progression system and should only be
    called during active scenario sessions. The method relies on internal player data
    tracking, so calling it outside of a valid scenario context may produce unexpected
    results. Performance is generally fast as it involves simple state checks.
  warnings: Never pass null pointers to this method as it will likely cause crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the ScenarioStepEntry pointer points to a valid
    step definition that exists in the scenario's data structure.
