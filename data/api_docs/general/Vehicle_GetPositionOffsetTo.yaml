  class: Vehicle
  method: GetPositionOffsetTo
  signature: int Vehicle::GetPositionOffsetTo(const int & endPos) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the positional offset of a vehicle relative to a specified
    end position.
  description: The GetPositionOffsetTo method computes the positional difference between
    the current vehicle's location and a given endpoint. This offset is typically
    used in vehicle movement calculations, pathfinding, or positioning adjustments
    within the game world. The method takes an integer parameter representing the
    end position and returns an integer value indicating the calculated offset. This
    functionality is essential for maintaining accurate vehicle positioning during
    travel, especially when dealing with complex terrain or dynamic environments.
  parameters:
  - name: endPos
    description: An integer value representing the target end position coordinate.
      This parameter defines where the vehicle's offset should be calculated relative
      to its current position.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the positional offset between the
    vehicle's current location and the specified endpoint. Positive values indicate
    movement in one direction, while negative values indicate movement in the opposite
    direction. The exact meaning of the returned value depends on the coordinate system
    used internally by the TrinityCore engine.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to calculate vehicle offset
    code: int currentOffset = vehicle->GetPositionOffsetTo(100); // Calculates offset
      to position 100
    language: cpp
  - title: Using offset for movement adjustment
    code: "int targetPosition = 500;\nint offset = vehicle->GetPositionOffsetTo(targetPosition);\n\
      if (offset > 0) {\n    // Adjust vehicle forward\n} else if (offset < 0) {\n\
      \    // Adjust vehicle backward\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other vehicle movement APIs
    to ensure precise positioning. The integer-based coordinate system suggests it
    may be working with discrete grid positions or internal world coordinates rather
    than continuous floating-point values.
  warnings: Ensure that the endPos parameter is within valid bounds for the current
    map or zone to avoid unexpected behavior. Since this method operates on vehicle
    positioning, incorrect usage could lead to vehicles appearing in invalid locations
    or behaving erratically during movement.
