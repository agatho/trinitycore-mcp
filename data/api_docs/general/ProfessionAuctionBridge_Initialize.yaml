  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: Initialize
  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the profession auction bridge system, setting up internal data
    structures and registering necessary callbacks for auction house operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the ProfessionAuctionBridge class for
    operation by establishing required internal state, loading configuration settings,
    and registering event handlers needed for processing auction house transactions
    related to profession items. This method typically runs during server startup
    or when the auction house system is initialized. It ensures that all necessary
    resources are allocated and that the bridge can properly communicate between the
    auction house subsystem and profession-specific item handling logic. The initialization
    process may involve validating data integrity, setting up database connections
    for auction records, and ensuring that all required callbacks are registered with
    the core auction house manager.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ProfessionAuctionBridge bridge;

      bridge.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. Repeated
    calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method is typically
    invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework during server startup, but
    can also be manually triggered if needed for testing or dynamic reinitialization.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within auction processing callbacks as it
    may cause deadlocks or inconsistent state. Ensure all dependent systems are ready
    before calling Initialize to avoid runtime errors.
