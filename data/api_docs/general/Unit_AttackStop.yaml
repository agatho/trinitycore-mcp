  class: Unit
  method: AttackStop
  signature: bool Unit::AttackStop()
documentation:
  brief: Stops the unit's current attack and clears the threat list.
  description: The AttackStop method halts any ongoing attack behavior for the Unit,
    removing it from combat state. It effectively stops the unit from attacking its
    target and clears all threat generated by the unit. This method is commonly used
    when a unit needs to cease combat or when transitioning between different combat
    states. The method returns true if the attack was successfully stopped, false
    otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the attack was successfully stopped, false otherwise. A
    return value of false typically indicates that no attack was active or that the
    unit was already not in combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = new Unit();\nbool result = target->AttackStop();\nif (result)\n\
      {\n    // Attack successfully stopped\n    std::cout << \"Attack stopped successfully\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    to manage unit behavior during combat. It does not necessarily remove the target
    from the unit's threat list, but rather stops the attack process itself.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when dealing with units that are
    actively engaged in combat, as stopping an attack may have unintended consequences
    on the unit's behavior and threat management.
