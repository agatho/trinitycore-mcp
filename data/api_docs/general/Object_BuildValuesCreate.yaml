  class: Object
  method: BuildValuesCreate
  signature: void Object::BuildValuesCreate(ByteBuffer * data, int flags, const Player
    * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and populates object data values for a player.
  description: This method constructs the object data values that are sent to a specific
    player, typically used in packet creation for object updates. It builds the necessary
    data structures based on flags and target player information, ensuring proper
    synchronization of object state between server and client. The method handles
    the construction of data fields including object fields, item fields, and other
    relevant data types depending on the object type and flags.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A pointer to a ByteBuffer that will contain the constructed data
      values for the object
  - name: flags
    description: An integer flag value determining which fields are included in the
      data construction, typically indicating object type or update flags
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to a Player object representing the target player for whom
      the data values are being constructed
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      ByteBuffer data;

      int flags = 0x1;

      Player* target_player = new Player();

      obj->BuildValuesCreate(&data, flags, target_player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with update packets and object
    synchronization mechanisms. Implementation details include handling of different
    object types and their respective field structures. Performance considerations
    involve memory allocation for the ByteBuffer and efficient data construction.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as incorrect flag values or
    target player references can lead to invalid data structures or client-side errors.
    The method should not be called on objects without proper initialization.
