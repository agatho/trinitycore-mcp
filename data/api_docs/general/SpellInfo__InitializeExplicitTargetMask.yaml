  brief: Initializes the explicit target mask for spell information, setting up target
    requirements for spell effects.
  description: This method initializes the explicit target mask for SpellInfo objects,
    which determines the target requirements for spell effects. It sets up the target
    mask based on the spell's explicit targets and ensures proper targeting behavior
    for spells that require specific target types. The method is typically called
    during spell initialization to establish target constraints for spell effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'SpellInfo* spellInfo = new SpellInfo();

      spellInfo->_InitializeExplicitTargetMask();

      // Initializes the target mask for the spell'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell initialization process and should
    not be called directly by game code. It's typically invoked during spell loading
    or initialization phases.
  warnings: This method should not be used outside of internal spell processing contexts.
    Calling it manually may cause target validation issues.
