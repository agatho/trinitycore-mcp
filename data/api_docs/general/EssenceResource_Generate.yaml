  class: EssenceResource
  method: Generate
  signature: void EssenceResource::Generate(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a specified amount of essence resource for the player.
  description: The Generate method increases the player's current essence resource
    by the provided amount. This method is typically used in game mechanics where
    players earn essence through various activities such as completing quests, defeating
    enemies, or participating in world events. The generated essence is added to the
    existing resource pool, and the method does not validate whether the amount exceeds
    any maximum limits. It is designed to be called during gameplay events or player
    actions that grant essence.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of essence resource to generate. Must be a non-negative
      integer value representing the amount of essence to add to the player's resource
      pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Essence Generation
    code: player->GetEssenceResource()->Generate(100);
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Essence Based on Quest Completion
    code: "if (questCompleted)\n{\n    player->GetEssenceResource()->Generate(500);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's essence resource without any validation
    or limit checks. Developers should ensure that the amount passed is appropriate
    for game balance and does not cause unintended behavior such as overflow or excessive
    resource accumulation.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very large value may lead to unexpected behavior
    or performance issues if not handled properly. Ensure that all calls are within
    reasonable bounds to maintain game stability and fairness.
