  signature: void Player::UpdateMaxHealth()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's maximum health value based on current attributes and
    modifiers.
  description: The UpdateMaxHealth method recalculates and sets the player's maximum
    health points by considering base stats, level, equipment bonuses, buffs, debuffs,
    and other game mechanics that affect health capacity. This method is typically
    invoked when a player's stats change, such as after leveling up, equipping new
    gear, or applying status effects. It ensures that the player's health pool accurately
    reflects their current character state within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateMaxHealth();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Equipment Change
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      // Assume player equipped new armor

      player->UpdateMaxHealth();

      // Health will now reflect the new equipment bonuses'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calls other stat calculation functions and may trigger
    updates to the player's visual health bar and related UI elements. It should be
    called whenever a change occurs that could affect maximum health, such as level
    ups, stat modifications, or gear changes.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method excessively in performance-critical code paths
    as it may involve multiple calculations and potential UI updates. Ensure that
    the player object is valid before calling to prevent undefined behavior.
