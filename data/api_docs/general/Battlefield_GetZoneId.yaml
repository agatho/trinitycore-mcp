  class: Battlefield
  method: GetZoneId
  signature: int Battlefield::GetZoneId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the zone identifier associated with the battlefield.
  description: The GetZoneId method returns the unique zone identifier (ZoneId) that
    corresponds to the battlefield instance. This identifier is used internally by
    TrinityCore to associate battlefield objects with their respective zones, enabling
    proper zone-based functionality such as faction control, area triggers, and zone-specific
    events. The returned value typically maps to a zone in the game's zone database
    and is essential for determining the geographical context of the battlefield within
    the broader World of Warcraft world system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the zone identifier (ZoneId) associated with this
    battlefield instance. This value corresponds to a valid zone entry in the game's
    zone database, typically matching the ZoneId field used in various game systems
    including area triggers, faction control, and zone-based events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);

      int zoneId = bf->GetZoneId();

      printf("Battlefield zone ID: %d\n", zoneId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Zone-Based Event Handling
    code: "void HandleBattlefieldUpdate(Battlefield* bf)\n{\n    int zoneId = bf->GetZoneId();\n\
      \    if (zoneId > 0)\n    {\n        // Process zone-specific battlefield events\n\
      \        sWorld->SendZoneScriptText(zoneId, \"Battlefield update in progress\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used during battlefield initialization and event
    handling to determine the geographical context of a battlefield. The zone ID returned
    should match entries in the `zone_template` database table, and it's typically
    set during the battlefield creation process. This method is thread-safe as it
    only reads from const member variables.
  warnings: Ensure that the Battlefield instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as calling GetZoneId on an uninitialized or destroyed battlefield
    may return invalid data. The returned zone ID should not be used directly for
    database queries without proper validation.
