api:
  class: WorldSession
  method: SendPetitionSigns
  signature: void WorldSession::SendPetitionSigns(const Petition * petition, Player
    * sendTo)
documentation:
  brief: Sends petition signature data to a player's client for display.
  description: The SendPetitionSigns method is responsible for transmitting the list
    of signatures associated with a specific petition to the client of the specified
    player. This allows the player to see who has signed the petition and when they
    did so. The method typically gets invoked when a player opens a petition or when
    signature updates occur. It handles the serialization and network transmission
    of petition signature information, ensuring that the client's UI accurately reflects
    the current state of signatures on the petition.
  parameters:
  - name: petition
    description: A pointer to the Petition object containing the signatures to be
      sent. Must not be null.
  - name: sendTo
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose client will receive the petition
      signature data. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send petition signatures to a player
    code: "Petition* myPetition = sObjectMgr->GetPetition(12345);\nPlayer* targetPlayer\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player, 67890));\nif (myPetition\
      \ && targetPlayer)\n{\n    session->SendPetitionSigns(myPetition, targetPlayer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the petition system in TrinityCore and directly interacts
    with the network layer to send data to players. It assumes that both the petition
    and player objects are valid and properly initialized before being passed.
  warnings: Ensure that the petition pointer is not null and that the target player
    is connected and valid before calling this method, otherwise it may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes.
