documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cooldown time for druid defensive abilities in PvP combat.
  description: The GetDruidDefensiveCooldowns method calculates and returns the remaining
    cooldown duration for a druid's defensive abilities when engaged in Player versus
    Player (PvP) combat. This method is typically used by the PvPCombatAI system to
    determine when a druid can next use defensive spells such as Barkskin, Survival
    Instincts, or other cooldown-based defensive measures. The returned value represents
    the time in milliseconds until the next available defensive ability usage. This
    functionality is crucial for AI decision-making in PvP scenarios where timing
    of defensive actions affects survival and combat effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the remaining cooldown time in milliseconds for
    druid defensive abilities. Returns 0 if no cooldown is active or if the player
    is not a druid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP Combat AI
    code: "int cooldown = ai->GetDruidDefensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\nif (cooldown ==\
      \ 0) {\n    // Use defensive ability\n    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_BARKSKIN,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Wait for cooldown\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"pvp\", \"Druid\
      \ defensive cooldown: {} ms\", cooldown);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player state tracking and spell
    cooldown management systems. It may be called frequently during PvP combat simulations,
    so performance is important. The method assumes the AI has access to a valid druid
    player object or context.
  warnings: The method signature includes an int* parameter named 'player' which appears
    unused in the signature but might be intended for internal use or future expansion.
    Ensure proper null checking if this parameter is expected to be used in implementation.
