documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the pet aura is removed when the player changes pets
  description: This method checks if a specific pet aura should be removed when the
    player switches to a different pet. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    pet auras can have different behaviors depending on whether they persist across
    pet changes or are automatically removed. This boolean flag controls that behavior
    for individual auras. The method is typically used during pet switching logic
    to determine cleanup requirements for active auras.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the aura should be removed when changing pets, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Check if aura is removed on pet change
    code: "if (petAura->IsRemovedOnChangePet()) {\n    // Remove aura from current\
      \ pet\n    pet->RemoveAura(petAura);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PetAura class which manages auras specifically
    for summoned pets. The implementation likely checks internal flags or configuration
    settings that define aura persistence behavior across pet transitions.
