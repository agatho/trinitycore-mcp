  signature: const int * DB2Manager::GetItemSpecOverrides(uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the item specialization overrides for a given item ID.
  description: The GetItemSpecOverrides method returns a constant pointer to an array
    of integers representing the specialization overrides associated with a specific
    item in the database. These overrides define how an item's properties or effects
    may change based on the player's specialization. The returned array is indexed
    by specialization ID and contains override values that modify item behavior for
    different classes and specs. This method is typically used during item processing
    or tooltip generation to determine how an item should behave for a specific player's
    specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing the specialization
    overrides for the specified item. The array size corresponds to the number of
    specializations in the game, with each index containing the override value for
    that specialization. Returns nullptr if no overrides are defined for the item
    or if the item ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through item spec overrides
    code: "const int* overrides = sDB2Manager->GetItemSpecOverrides(12345);\nif (overrides\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SPECIALIZATIONS; ++i)\n    {\n\
      \        if (overrides[i] != 0)\n        {\n            // Process override\
      \ value for specialization i\n            printf(\"Specialization %d override:\
      \ %d\\n\", i, overrides[i]);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer points to internal data structures managed by the DB2Manager.
    The array size is determined by the maximum number of specializations in the game
    and should not be modified. This method performs a lookup in an internal cache,
    making it efficient for repeated calls with the same item ID.
  warnings: The returned pointer becomes invalid if the DB2Manager's data is reloaded
    or if the underlying item data changes. Always check for null return values before
    dereferencing the pointer to avoid crashes. This method should not be used in
    performance-critical code paths without proper caching mechanisms.
