documentation:
  brief: Sends a quest timer failed message to the player's client
  description: This method sends a notification to the player's client indicating
    that a quest timer has failed, typically used when a quest cannot be completed
    within the required time limit. The method is part of the player's communication
    interface with the game server and is commonly invoked during quest completion
    or failure scenarios. It helps maintain synchronization between the player's client
    and server regarding quest progress and timing.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which the timer has failed.
      This value determines which quest's timer is being sent to the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      player->SendQuestTimerFailed(questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a quest timer expires or when the player
    fails to complete a quest within the required time frame. It may be used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods like SendQuestUpdateComplete or SendQuestUpdateFailed
    to maintain proper communication with the client.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to client-side synchronization issues,
    potentially causing quest timers to appear incorrectly or causing the player to
    miss quest completion notifications. Care should be taken when calling this method
    during quest progression.
