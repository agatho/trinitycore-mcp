documentation:
  brief: Updates the example manager state based on elapsed time since last update
  description: The OnUpdate method is a core callback function that gets invoked periodically
    by the game loop to process and update the internal state of the ExampleManager.
    It receives a time delta parameter representing milliseconds elapsed since the
    last execution, allowing the manager to perform time-based operations such as
    cooldown management, event scheduling, or periodic checks. This method is typically
    called from TrinityCore's main update loop and should be used for lightweight,
    non-blocking operations that need to occur regularly. The implementation must
    handle the elapsed time appropriately to maintain consistent behavior across different
    server loads and frame rates.
  parameters:
  - name: elapsed
    description: The number of milliseconds that have passed since the last update
      call. This value is used to determine how much time has passed for time-based
      calculations and should be used to scale any time-dependent operations within
      the manager.
  returns: null

    code: "void ExampleManager::OnUpdate(uint32 elapsed)\n{\n    // Process cooldowns\n\
      \    if (cooldownTimer > 0)\n        cooldownTimer = std::max(0u, cooldownTimer\
      \ - elapsed);\n    \n    // Handle periodic events\n    if (eventTimer <= elapsed)\n\

    code: "void ExampleManager::OnUpdate(uint32 elapsed)\n{\n    // Update multiple\
      \ timers\n    for (auto& timer : timers)\n    {\n        if (timer.active)\n\

      \ timers.end(),\n        [](const Timer& t) { return t.timeLeft == 0; }), timers.end());\n\
      \    \n    // Process pending actions\n    while (!pendingActions.empty())\n\
      \    {\n        auto action = pendingActions.front();\n        pendingActions.pop();\n\
      \        ExecuteAction(action);\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is called from the main game thread and should avoid heavy computations
    or blocking operations. It's designed to be lightweight and fast, typically completing
    within a few milliseconds. The elapsed parameter provides accurate timing information
    for smooth gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Do not perform database operations directly in this method as it may cause
    performance issues or deadlocks. Avoid calling methods that might block or take
    significant time to complete. Be cautious with thread synchronization if the manager
    is accessed from multiple threads.
