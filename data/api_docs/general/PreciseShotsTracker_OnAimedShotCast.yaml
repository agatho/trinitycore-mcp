  class: PreciseShotsTracker
  method: OnAimedShotCast
  signature: void PreciseShotsTracker::OnAimedShotCast()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the logic when a player casts the Aimed Shot ability, updating internal
    tracking state for precision shot mechanics.
  description: The OnAimedShotCast method is invoked when a Hunter player successfully
    casts the Aimed Shot spell. This method updates the internal state of the PreciseShotsTracker
    to reflect that an Aimed Shot has been cast, which may influence subsequent shot
    mechanics or cooldowns. The method does not directly interact with the game world
    or apply effects; instead, it manages the tracking logic for precision-based abilities
    within the Hunter's shot rotation system. It is typically called from the spell
    casting handler or combat log processor as part of the Hunter's ability execution
    flow.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Handler
    code: "void Hunter::HandleAimedShotCast()\n{\n    // ... spell validation and\
      \ preparation ...\n    m_preciseShotsTracker.OnAimedShotCast();\n    // ...\
      \ continue with normal shot logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already validated that they are eligible
    to cast Aimed Shot (e.g., have the ability learned, are in a valid combat state,
    etc.). The method does not perform any checks for these preconditions. It is designed
    to be lightweight and should not block or delay spell execution.
  warnings: Do not call this method unless you are certain that an Aimed Shot was
    actually cast by the player. Incorrect invocation may lead to inconsistent tracking
    of shot mechanics, potentially affecting the accuracy of subsequent precision-based
    abilities.
