  method: GetDemonHunterOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetDemonHunterOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current cooldown status of Demon Hunter's offensive abilities
    for a specified player.
  description: The GetDemonHunterOffensiveCooldowns method is used to determine the
    cooldown state of a Demon Hunter's primary offensive abilities within the PvP
    combat AI system. This method evaluates the player's current ability cooldowns
    and returns an integer value representing the status or remaining time of these
    abilities. The implementation likely checks for key abilities such as Fel Rush,
    Eye Beam, and other major offensive spells that are crucial in PvP scenarios.
    It is designed to assist in decision-making processes for AI behavior during combat
    situations where timing and ability usage are critical.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object representing the Demon Hunter whose
      offensive cooldowns are being evaluated. This parameter must point to a valid
      Player instance with Demon Hunter class.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the cooldown status of Demon Hunter's
    offensive abilities. A positive value typically represents remaining cooldown
    time in milliseconds, zero indicates that all abilities are ready, and negative
    values may indicate error conditions or special states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* dhPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid Demon Hunter player\n\
      int cooldownStatus = pvpCombatAI->GetDemonHunterOffensiveCooldowns(dhPlayer);\n\
      if (cooldownStatus == 0) {\n    // All abilities are ready\n    // Proceed with\
      \ offensive action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Ability Decision Making
    code: "Player* dhPlayer = ...;\nint cooldowns = pvpCombatAI->GetDemonHunterOffensiveCooldowns(dhPlayer);\n\
      if (cooldowns > 0) {\n    // Some abilities are on cooldown\n    // Wait or\
      \ use alternative abilities\n} else if (cooldowns == 0) {\n    // All abilities\
      \ ready\n    // Execute primary offensive sequence\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and should only be called on
    Demon Hunter players. The returned integer value may vary based on internal AI
    logic and game state. Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is
    valid and not null to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null player pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. This method should only be used for Demon Hunter players;
    calling it with other classes may produce unexpected results or errors.
