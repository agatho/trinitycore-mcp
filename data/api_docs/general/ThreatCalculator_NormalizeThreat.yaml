  class: ThreatCalculator
  method: NormalizeThreat
  signature: float ThreatCalculator::NormalizeThreat(float threat, float maxThreat)
documentation:
  brief: Normalizes threat values to a percentage scale between 0 and 100.
  description: The NormalizeThreat method scales a given threat value relative to
    the maximum possible threat, returning a normalized percentage. This is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's combat system to display threat levels as percentages
    for mobs and players. The method ensures that threat values are consistently scaled
    regardless of the absolute threat amounts, making it easier to compare threat
    levels across different encounters or creatures. It performs a simple division
    operation followed by multiplication by 100 to convert the ratio into a percentage.
  parameters:
  - name: threat
    description: The current threat value to be normalized. Must be a non-negative
      floating-point number representing the threat amount.
  - name: maxThreat
    description: The maximum possible threat value in the current context. This defines
      the upper bound for normalization. Must be a positive floating-point number
      greater than zero.
  returns: A float value representing the normalized threat percentage. Returns 0.0
    if maxThreat is zero or negative, and returns 100.0 if threat equals or exceeds
    maxThreat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Normalization
    code: 'float currentThreat = 500.0f;

      float maxThreat = 1000.0f;

      float normalized = ThreatCalculator::NormalizeThreat(currentThreat, maxThreat);

      // Result: 50.0f (50% threat level)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Edge Case Handling
    code: 'float threat = 1500.0f;

      float maxThreat = 1000.0f;

      float normalized = ThreatCalculator::NormalizeThreat(threat, maxThreat);

      // Result: 150.0f (exceeds 100% as expected)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that threat values are non-negative and that maxThreat
    is positive. The normalization process does not clamp the result to [0, 100] range;
    it simply returns the raw percentage. For display purposes in UI or combat logs,
    developers may want to apply additional clamping logic.
  warnings: Be cautious when using very large threat values or extremely small maxThreat
    values as they can lead to unexpected results due to floating-point precision
    limitations. Also note that this method does not validate input parameters, so
    invalid inputs may produce undefined behavior.
