  class: Group
  method: ChangeMembersGroup
  signature: void Group::ChangeMembersGroup(int guid, int group)
documentation:
  brief: Changes the group assignment of a specified group member.
  description: The ChangeMembersGroup method updates the group ID of a player within
    a group. This method is typically used when reorganizing group members, such as
    moving a player from one subgroup to another or removing them from a group entirely.
    The method modifies the internal group structure and ensures that the player's
    group membership is correctly reflected in the group's data structures. It does
    not perform any validation on the provided group ID, so it's the caller's responsibility
    to ensure the target group exists and is valid.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose group assignment
      will be changed.
  - name: group
    description: The new group ID to assign to the player. A value of -1 typically
      indicates removal from any group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move a Player to Subgroup 2
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->ChangeMembersGroup(player->GetGUID(),\
      \ 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove a Player from Group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->ChangeMembersGroup(player->GetGUID(),\
      \ -1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal group data structures and should be
    used carefully. It does not send any network updates to clients, so calling code
    must ensure that appropriate messages are sent to inform players of the change.
  warnings: Using an invalid group ID or attempting to move a player who is not in
    the group may lead to undefined behavior. Always verify that the player belongs
    to the group before calling this method.
