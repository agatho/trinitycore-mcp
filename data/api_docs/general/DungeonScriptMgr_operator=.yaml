documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one DungeonScriptMgr instance to another
  description: The assignment operator for DungeonScriptMgr performs a deep copy of
    all internal data members from the source object to the target object. This method
    ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of script-related data structures,
    preventing shared state issues. In the context of TrinityCore's dungeon scripting
    system, this operation is typically used when copying or reassigning dungeon script
    managers during world state transitions or object initialization. The operator
    handles memory management internally and returns a reference to the assigned object
    for chaining operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source DungeonScriptMgr object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current DungeonScriptMgr object after assignment has
    been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'DungeonScriptMgr manager1;

      DungeonScriptMgr manager2 = manager1; // Uses copy constructor

      // or

      manager2 = manager1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Assignment Operations
    code: 'DungeonScriptMgr mgr1, mgr2, mgr3;

      // Chain multiple assignments

      mgr1 = mgr2 = mgr3; // All managers get the same data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements deep copying to prevent dangling references
    or shared state between script manager instances. Since DungeonScriptMgr is part
    of TrinityCore's dungeon scripting infrastructure, proper assignment ensures that
    each instance maintains its own independent set of script handlers and data structures.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large DungeonScriptMgr objects as the operation
    may involve significant memory copying. Ensure that the source object remains
    valid throughout the assignment process to avoid undefined behavior.
