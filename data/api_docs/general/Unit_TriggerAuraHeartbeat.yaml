  signature: void Unit::TriggerAuraHeartbeat()
documentation:
  brief: Triggers the heartbeat aura effect on the unit, causing periodic damage or
    healing based on the aura's properties.
  description: The TriggerAuraHeartbeat method activates a specific aura that simulates
    a heartbeat effect, typically used for periodic damage or healing over time. This
    method is commonly employed in game mechanics where units have aura effects that
    trigger at regular intervals, such as life drain, mana regeneration, or other
    periodic effects. The method does not require any parameters and directly operates
    on the unit's aura system to execute the heartbeat behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetUnit();\nif (target)\n{\n    target->TriggerAuraHeartbeat();\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with aura application or removal
    logic and may be part of a larger system that handles periodic effects. Performance
    considerations include the frequency of calls, as frequent triggering could impact
    server performance if not properly managed.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to unexpected behavior, especially
    if the unit does not have an active heartbeat aura. Care should be taken when
    using this method in combination with other aura-related functions to avoid conflicts
    or unintended side effects.
