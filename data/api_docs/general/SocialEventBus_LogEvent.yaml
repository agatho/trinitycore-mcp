  class: SocialEventBus
  method: LogEvent
  signature: void SocialEventBus::LogEvent(const SocialEvent & event, const std::string
    & action) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a social event with associated action to the event bus for tracking
    and processing.
  description: The LogEvent method records a SocialEvent along with an associated
    action string into the social event bus system. This allows for centralized logging
    and handling of social interactions within the TrinityCore framework, such as
    player friendships, guild activities, or chat events. The method is typically
    used by subsystems that need to track social behavior for game mechanics, analytics,
    or audit purposes. It does not return any value but may trigger internal event
    handlers or database writes depending on the implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The SocialEvent object containing details about the social interaction
      that occurred. This includes information such as involved players, event type,
      timestamp, and related metadata.
  - name: action
    description: A string describing the action associated with the event. This could
      be a verb or identifier like "friend_added", "guild_join", or "chat_message"
      that helps categorize and process the event appropriately.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'SocialEvent event;

      event.type = SocialEventType::CHAT_MESSAGE;

      event.player1 = 12345;

      event.player2 = 67890;

      event.timestamp = time(nullptr);


      socialEventBus.LogEvent(event, "chat_message");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging a Friendship Event
    code: 'SocialEvent friendEvent;

      friendEvent.type = SocialEventType::FRIEND_ADDED;

      friendEvent.player1 = 54321;

      friendEvent.player2 = 98765;

      friendEvent.timestamp = time(nullptr);


      socialEventBus.LogEvent(friendEvent, "friend_added");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded environment,
    but developers should verify the underlying implementation. It may trigger additional
    processing or database writes depending on how the SocialEventBus is configured.
  warnings: Ensure that the SocialEvent object passed to this method is properly initialized
    before calling to avoid undefined behavior. Passing invalid or uninitialized event
    data may lead to incorrect logging or system errors.
