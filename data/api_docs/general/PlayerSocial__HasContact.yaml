  class: PlayerSocial
  method: _HasContact
  signature: bool PlayerSocial::_HasContact(const int & guid, SocialFlag flags)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has a specific contact in their social list with given
    flags.
  description: The _HasContact method determines whether a specified player GUID exists
    in the current player's social list and matches the provided SocialFlag criteria.
    This internal method is used by the TrinityCore social system to verify relationships
    such as friends, ignores, or mutual acquaintances. It performs a lookup within
    the player's social data structure and returns true if the contact meets all specified
    flag conditions. The method respects the game's social mechanics where different
    flags represent different types of relationships (e.g., friend, ignore, blocked).
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the player to check for in the social
      list. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the player's database
      ID.
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask representing the SocialFlag conditions that must be satisfied
      for the contact to be considered as having the specified relationship. Common
      flags include SOCIAL_FLAG_FRIEND, SOCIAL_FLAG_IGNORED, etc.
  returns: Returns true if the player with the given GUID exists in the social list
    and satisfies all the provided SocialFlag conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player is in friends list
    code: "if (playerSocial->_HasContact(12345, SOCIAL_FLAG_FRIEND)) {\n    // Player\
      \ with GUID 12345 is in the friend list\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Verify ignore status of a player
    code: "if (playerSocial->_HasContact(67890, SOCIAL_FLAG_IGNORED)) {\n    // Player\
      \ with GUID 67890 is in the ignore list\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly from outside
    the PlayerSocial class. The method performs a direct lookup in the internal social
    map structure, which is optimized for performance. It assumes that the provided
    GUID and flags are valid and does not perform any validation checks.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or uninitialized GUID values as it
    may lead to undefined behavior. This method should only be used within the context
    of the social system's internal logic, not from external modules.
