  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetJumpOrientationFixed(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables fixed jump orientation for movement splines.
  description: The SetJumpOrientationFixed method controls whether a spline-based
    movement will maintain a fixed orientation during a jump animation. When enabled,
    the character's facing direction remains constant throughout the jump, which is
    useful for certain special abilities or scripted events where orientation should
    not change during vertical movement. This setting affects how the movement spline
    interpolates orientation values during the jump phase of the motion. The method
    does not validate the current state of the spline and will apply the setting immediately
    to subsequent jumps.

  examples:
  - title: Enable Fixed Jump Orientation
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetJumpOrientationFixed(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Fixed Jump Orientation
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetJumpOrientationFixed(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects the orientation behavior during jump animations.
    It does not influence other movement types such as walking or running. The setting
    persists until explicitly changed, and should be called before initiating a jump
    to ensure proper effect.
