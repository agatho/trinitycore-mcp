  method: RegisterPosition
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::RegisterPosition(Player * bot, const int &
    pos)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a player's position for strategic AI processing within the bot
    system.
  description: The RegisterPosition method is used to store or update a player's current
    position in the context of AI-based bot behavior. This function allows the system
    to track where players are located, which is essential for pathfinding, targeting,
    and positioning strategies. It typically integrates with internal data structures
    that maintain player location data for use by various AI subsystems such as movement
    logic, combat positioning, or quest-related navigation. The method accepts a pointer
    to a Player object representing the bot and an integer position value that likely
    corresponds to a predefined location index or coordinate within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose position is being registered.
      This represents the AI-controlled character (bot) for which the position data
      is stored.
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the position index or
      coordinate. This value likely maps to a specific location in the game world,
      such as a waypoint, target point, or strategic area.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Registration
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      int positionIndex = 5;

      PositionStrategyBase::RegisterPosition(myBot, positionIndex);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Bot Position During AI Loop
    code: "void UpdateBotPosition(Player* bot)\n{\n    int currentPos = GetPlayerWorldPosition(bot);\n\
      \    PositionStrategyBase::RegisterPosition(bot, currentPos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI positioning framework and may be
    called frequently during bot updates. It's important to ensure that the position
    value passed is valid and within expected bounds to prevent undefined behavior
    or incorrect AI decisions.
  warnings: Passing an invalid player pointer or an out-of-range position index could
    lead to memory corruption or unexpected AI behavior. Ensure proper validation
    before calling this method in performance-critical sections.
