  class: CombatEvent
  method: SpellCastStart
  signature: CombatEvent CombatEvent::SpellCastStart(int caster, int target, uint32
    spellId, uint32 castTime)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new CombatEvent object representing the start of a
    spell cast by a caster on a target.
  description: The SpellCastStart method initializes a CombatEvent instance that signifies
    the beginning of a spell casting action in the game world. This event is typically
    used to track and process spell casting mechanics, including handling cast times,
    interruptible actions, and synchronization with client-side visual effects. The
    method takes parameters for the caster's identifier, target's identifier, the
    spell ID being cast, and the cast time duration in milliseconds. It returns a
    fully constructed CombatEvent object that can be queued or processed by the combat
    system to manage spell execution flow.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity initiating the spell cast.
      This is typically a player, NPC, or creature.
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity receiving the spell.
      Can be a player, NPC, or game object.
  - name: spellId
    description: The numeric identifier of the spell being cast. This must correspond
      to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  - name: castTime
    description: The duration in milliseconds that the spell casting will take. Used
      for calculating cast progress and determining when the spell completes.
  returns: A CombatEvent object representing the start of a spell cast, containing
    all relevant data about the casting action for further processing within the combat
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Cast Start Event
    code: CombatEvent event = CombatEvent::SpellCastStart(12345, 67890, 1234, 2000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Spell Cast Event for Player Casting
    code: 'uint32 playerGUID = player->GetGUID();

      uint32 targetGUID = target->GetGUID();

      uint32 spellID = 5678;

      uint32 castTimeMS = 1500;

      CombatEvent event = CombatEvent::SpellCastStart(playerGUID, targetGUID, spellID,
      castTimeMS);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's combat system and should be used
    in conjunction with other CombatEvent methods to fully represent a spell casting
    sequence. The returned CombatEvent object must be properly queued or dispatched
    for processing by the game engine's combat subsystem.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster and target GUIDs are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid identifiers may cause undefined behavior or crashes in the
    combat system. Also verify that the spellId corresponds to an existing spell entry
    in the database.
