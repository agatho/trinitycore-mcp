  method: ~ObjectiveTracker
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::~ObjectiveTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ObjectiveTracker instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ObjectiveTracker destructor is responsible for cleaning up all
    memory and resources allocated by the ObjectiveTracker object. This includes releasing
    references to active objectives, clearing internal tracking data structures, and
    ensuring no dangling pointers remain. The destructor is automatically invoked
    when an ObjectiveTracker instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method ensures
    proper cleanup of quest and objective tracking state for players, preventing memory
    leaks and maintaining system stability during player logout or zone changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ObjectiveTracker instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ObjectiveTracker tracker;\n    // ... use tracker\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when tracker goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of ObjectiveTracker pointer
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = new ObjectiveTracker();

      // ... use tracker ...

      delete tracker; // Triggers destructor

      tracker = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for maintaining
    memory integrity in TrinityCore. It's important to note that this method should
    not be called directly on stack-allocated objects, as the compiler handles destruction
    automatically. The destructor is typically invoked by the game engine during player
    logout or when cleaning up temporary tracking data.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor on stack objects - let the compiler
    handle automatic destruction. Avoid calling delete on a pointer that has already
    been deleted, which could lead to undefined behavior. This destructor assumes
    all internal references are valid and properly initialized before destruction.
