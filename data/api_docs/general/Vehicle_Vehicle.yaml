  brief: Moves a vehicle object to another vehicle object using move semantics
  description: The Vehicle constructor that accepts a Vehicle&& parameter is a move
    constructor used to transfer ownership of resources from one Vehicle object to
    another. This constructor is typically used when creating a new Vehicle instance
    by moving an existing temporary or rvalue Vehicle object, avoiding expensive deep
    copies. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this would
    be relevant when handling vehicle objects that represent mounts, vehicles, or
    other rideable entities in the game world. The move constructor ensures efficient
    resource management during object creation and assignment operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a Vehicle
    code: 'Vehicle* newVehicle = new Vehicle(std::move(oldVehicle));

      // oldVehicle is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Move Constructor in Container
    code: 'std::vector<Vehicle> vehicles;

      Vehicle tempVehicle;

      vehicles.push_back(std::move(tempVehicle));

      // tempVehicle is now moved into the vector, no copy occurs'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called with rvalue expressions. After moving,
    the source object should not be used in a meaningful way as its state becomes
    valid but unspecified. The move constructor is part of C++11's move semantics
    and is crucial for performance optimization when dealing with objects that manage
    resources.
  warnings: Using the move constructor on an already moved-from object results in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the source object is not used after being moved
    from. This constructor should not be called directly on lvalue expressions without
    std::move().
