  method: ~QuestValidation
  signature: void QuestValidation::~QuestValidation()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a QuestValidation instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The QuestValidation destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of a QuestValidation object. This
    method is automatically invoked when a QuestValidation instance goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource deallocation, preventing
    memory leaks within the TrinityCore framework's quest validation subsystem. The
    destructor typically handles cleanup of internal data structures, cached quest
    information, and any temporary allocations used during quest validation processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of QuestValidation object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    QuestValidation validator;\n    // ... use\
      \ validator ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when validator goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of QuestValidation pointer
    code: 'QuestValidation* validator = new QuestValidation();

      // ... use validator ...

      delete validator; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the compiler and should not be invoked
    directly. It's important to understand that QuestValidation objects are typically
    managed through smart pointers or stack allocation in TrinityCore's architecture,
    making explicit destruction rare. The implementation likely includes cleanup of
    internal caches and temporary data structures used during quest validation.
  warnings: Developers should never manually call this destructor as it will lead
    to undefined behavior. When using QuestValidation objects in containers or as
    members of other classes, ensure proper ownership semantics are maintained to
    prevent double-deletion issues.
