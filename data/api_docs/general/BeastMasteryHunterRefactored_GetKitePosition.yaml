  signature: int BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::GetKitePosition(int * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal kite position for a beast mastery hunter
    to maintain distance from targets while maximizing damage output.
  description: The GetKitePosition method determines the ideal positioning strategy
    for a beast mastery hunter during combat, specifically focusing on maintaining
    optimal distance from enemies to ensure continuous attack effectiveness. This
    method evaluates various factors including enemy movement patterns, hunter's pet
    behavior, and spell cooldowns to compute a recommended position that allows for
    sustained damage output without compromising safety. The returned value represents
    a normalized position indicator that can be used by the AI system to adjust the
    hunter's movement and positioning strategy during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated kite position. A positive
    value indicates a forward movement direction, while a negative value suggests
    retreating or lateral movement. Zero typically represents maintaining current
    position. The exact scale and interpretation of this value depends on internal
    AI calculations and may vary based on specific encounter mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "int kitePosition = hunter->GetKitePosition();\nif (kitePosition > 0) {\n\
      \    // Move forward to maintain optimal distance\n    player->SetFacingToObject(target);\n\
      \    player->MoveForward();\n} else if (kitePosition < 0) {\n    // Retreat\
      \ or reposition\n    player->MoveBackward();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used within the AI decision-making loop for beast
    mastery hunters. The implementation likely takes into account pet positioning,
    cooldown states of abilities like Aspect of the Cheetah, and target movement patterns
    to determine optimal positioning. Performance is critical as this method may be
    called frequently during active combat.
  warnings: The return value should not be directly used for movement commands without
    proper validation, as it represents a relative positioning indicator rather than
    absolute coordinates. Incorrect interpretation could lead to inefficient or dangerous
    positioning decisions in combat situations.
