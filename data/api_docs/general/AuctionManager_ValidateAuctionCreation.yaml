api:
  class: AuctionManager
  method: ValidateAuctionCreation
  signature: bool AuctionManager::ValidateAuctionCreation(Player * bot, Item * item,
    uint64 bidPrice, uint64 buyoutPrice)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether an auction can be created for a given item with specified
    bid and buyout prices.
  description: The ValidateAuctionCreation method checks if the provided parameters
    are valid for creating an auction in the Auction House system. It ensures that
    the item being auctioned is eligible, the bid and buyout prices meet minimum requirements,
    and the player has sufficient permissions or resources to list the item. This
    validation is crucial before proceeding with actual auction creation to prevent
    invalid or exploitative listings. The method performs checks such as ensuring
    the item is not soulbound, meets auction house restrictions, and that the pricing
    complies with game economy rules.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player attempting to
      create the auction. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object that is being listed for auction. The
      item must be in the player's inventory and not bound to another player.
  - name: bidPrice
    description: The minimum bid price for the auction, specified in copper (100 copper
      = 1 silver). Must be a positive value that meets the minimum auction bid requirements.
  - name: buyoutPrice
    description: The buyout price for the item, specified in copper. If set to 0,
      no buyout is allowed. Must be greater than or equal to the bid price and meet
      auction house rules.
  returns: Returns true if all validation checks pass and the auction can be created;
    otherwise returns false if any validation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Creation Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* item = ...;\nuint64 bidPrice = 10000; // 1\
      \ silver\nuint64 buyoutPrice = 50000; // 5 silver\nbool isValid = sAuctionMgr->ValidateAuctionCreation(player,\
      \ item, bidPrice, buyoutPrice);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with auction\
      \ creation\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation with Zero Buyout Price
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* item = ...;\nuint64 bidPrice = 1000; // 10\
      \ copper\nuint64 buyoutPrice = 0; // No buyout allowed\nbool isValid = sAuctionMgr->ValidateAuctionCreation(player,\
      \ item, bidPrice, buyoutPrice);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with auction\
      \ creation without buyout\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before attempting to create an actual auction
    in the database. It does not perform any database operations but rather validates
    the input parameters against internal rules and restrictions. The validation includes
    checking item binding status, price limits, and player permissions.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that the Player and Item pointers
    are valid. Passing null or invalid pointers will result in undefined behavior.
    Also, note that even if validation passes, the actual auction creation may still
    fail due to server-side limitations or economy constraints.
