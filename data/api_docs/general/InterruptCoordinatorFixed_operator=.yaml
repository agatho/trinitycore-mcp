documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one InterruptCoordinatorFixed object to another
  description: The assignment operator for InterruptCoordinatorFixed performs a deep
    copy of all member variables from the source object to the target object. This
    method ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of their data, preventing
    shared references that could lead to unexpected behavior or memory corruption.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this operation is
    typically used when reassigning interrupt coordination logic between different
    game entities or resetting the state of an interrupt coordinator. The operator
    returns a reference to the left-hand side object to allow for chaining assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source InterruptCoordinatorFixed object whose contents will be
      copied to this object
  returns: A reference to the current InterruptCoordinatorFixed object (this), allowing
    for assignment chaining operations such as obj1 = obj2 = obj3;
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator1;

      InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator2;

      coordinator1 = coordinator2; // Assigns contents of coordinator2 to coordinator1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordA, coordB, coordC;

      coordA = coordB = coordC; // Chained assignment - all three objects get the
      contents of coordC'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy mechanism to ensure that internal
    data structures are properly duplicated. The implementation should handle any
    dynamically allocated memory or complex member objects correctly to avoid shallow
    copying issues.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this operator with objects that contain pointers
    or references to external resources, as improper handling may lead to dangling
    pointers or resource leaks if not implemented carefully.
