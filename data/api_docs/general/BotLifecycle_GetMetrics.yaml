  class: BotLifecycle
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const BotPerformanceMetrics & BotLifecycle::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the performance metrics of the bot lifecycle.
  description: The GetMetrics method provides access to a structured set of performance-related
    data for the bot lifecycle. This includes timing information, resource usage statistics,
    and other diagnostic data that can be used to monitor and analyze the behavior
    of bots within the TrinityCore environment. The returned reference is const, ensuring
    that the metrics cannot be modified through this interface. This method is typically
    used for debugging, monitoring, or performance analysis purposes during bot operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a BotPerformanceMetrics object containing detailed
    performance statistics and diagnostic information about the bot's lifecycle operations.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Performance Metrics
    code: 'const BotPerformanceMetrics& metrics = botLifecycle.GetMetrics();

      uint32 updateCount = metrics.update_count;

      uint64 totalUpdateTime = metrics.total_update_time_ms;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data structures that may be updated
    asynchronously. If thread safety is required, callers should ensure proper synchronization
    mechanisms are in place when accessing these metrics concurrently.
