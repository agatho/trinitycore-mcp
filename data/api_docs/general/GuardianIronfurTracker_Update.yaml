  class: GuardianIronfurTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void GuardianIronfurTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the ironfur guardian's tracking state based on the provided player
    bot.
  description: The Update method in GuardianIronfurTracker is responsible for managing
    and refreshing the state of an ironfur guardian AI behavior. This method processes
    the current status of the player bot, including health, mana, positioning, and
    combat state to determine appropriate actions for the guardian. It evaluates whether
    the guardian should remain active, switch targets, or perform specific abilities
    based on the bot's condition and environment. The method typically runs during
    each AI update cycle and ensures that the guardian's behavior remains synchronized
    with the player's current situation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that the ironfur
      guardian is tracking. This parameter must not be null and should represent a
      valid player instance within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void MyAI::Update() {\n    if (guardianIronfurTracker) {\n        guardianIronfurTracker->Update(playerBot);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Error Handling
    code: "void GuardianAI::UpdateIronfurTracker(Player* bot) {\n    if (!bot) {\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    \n    if (guardianIronfurTracker) {\n        guardianIronfurTracker->Update(bot);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked directly outside of AI context. The implementation may involve
    checking player state, calculating distances, evaluating combat conditions, and
    potentially triggering guardian abilities or behavior changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null before calling Update. Passing an invalid or destroyed player reference can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
