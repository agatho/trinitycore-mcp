documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads spell immunity data from database into memory for fast
    lookup during spell processing.
  description: The LoadSpellInfoImmunities method is responsible for loading all spell
    immunity definitions from the database into internal memory structures. This includes
    information about which spells are immune to others, such as dispel mechanics,
    aura immunities, and damage type resistances. The method typically runs during
    server startup or database reload operations to ensure that all spell interaction
    rules are properly initialized before gameplay begins. It processes data from
    the 'spell_immunity' table in the database and populates internal lookup tables
    used by the spell system for real-time immunity checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Server Startup Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellSystems()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellInfoImmunities();\n\
      \    // Other spell system initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization phase and should
    not be invoked during active gameplay as it may cause race conditions or inconsistent
    state. The loaded immunity data is cached in memory for fast access during spell
    casting and aura application operations.
  warnings: Calling this method during active gameplay can lead to undefined behavior
    due to concurrent access to the spell system. This method should only be called
    when the server is in a safe initialization state with no active players or ongoing
    spell processing.
