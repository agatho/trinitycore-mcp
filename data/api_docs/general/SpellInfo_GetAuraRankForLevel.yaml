  method: GetAuraRankForLevel
  signature: const SpellInfo * SpellInfo::GetAuraRankForLevel(uint8 level) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell info for the aura rank corresponding to a specific level.
  description: This method retrieves the SpellInfo object that represents the aura
    rank associated with a given level. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    spell system to determine which spell level corresponds to a particular player
    level, especially when dealing with spells that have multiple ranks or levels.
    The method typically returns nullptr if no matching spell info is found for the
    specified level, indicating that the spell does not exist at that level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the SpellInfo object representing the aura rank for
    the given level. Returns nullptr if no such spell exists or if the level is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: const SpellInfo* spellInfo = spellInfo->GetAuraRankForLevel(10);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "if (spellInfo != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the spell info for further processing\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Spell ID: \" << spellInfo->Id << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // Handle case where no spell exists at level\n    std::cout << \"No spell\
      \ found for level 10\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine the correct spell level based on player's current level. It may involve
    internal lookup tables or caches depending on how the SpellInfo object was constructed.
  warnings: The method may return nullptr if a valid spell does not exist for the
    specified level, which could lead to null pointer dereferences if not properly
    handled in code. Care should be taken when using this method in contexts where
    spell levels are dynamically determined.
