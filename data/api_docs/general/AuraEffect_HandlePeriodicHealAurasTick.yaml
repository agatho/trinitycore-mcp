  signature: void AuraEffect::HandlePeriodicHealAurasTick(Unit * target, Unit * caster)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Applies a periodic healing effect to the target unit.
  description: The HandlePeriodicHealAurasTick method is responsible for applying
    the healing effect of periodic heal auras to a target unit. This method is typically
    invoked during the tick phase of an aura's duration, where the aura periodically
    restores health to the affected unit. It takes into account the caster's influence
    and the aura's properties to determine the amount of healing applied. The method
    ensures that healing effects are properly calculated and applied according to
    game mechanics such as spell power scaling, critical strikes, and any applicable
    modifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The Unit object that will receive the periodic healing effect. This
      is typically the unit affected by the aura.
  - name: caster
    description: The Unit object that cast the aura and is responsible for providing
      the healing source. This may be used to calculate healing amounts based on caster
      stats or abilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura tick handler
    code: "void MyAura::HandleTick(Unit* target, Unit* caster)\n{\n    AuraEffect::HandlePeriodicHealAurasTick(target,\
      \ caster);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom healing with additional logic
    code: "void CustomHealAura::HandleTick(Unit* target, Unit* caster)\n{\n    if\
      \ (target && caster)\n    {\n        // Apply custom healing modifiers\n   \
      \     int32 healAmount = CalculateHealing(caster, target);\n        target->ModifyHealth(healAmount);\n\
      \        AuraEffect::HandlePeriodicHealAurasTick(target, caster);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura tick system and is automatically called by
    the core when a periodic heal aura's tick interval elapses. It should not be directly
    invoked outside of the aura tick handling mechanism unless specifically required
    for custom behavior. The healing calculation may involve scaling based on caster's
    spell power, critical hit chance, and other game mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use or override of this method can lead to incorrect healing
    application or performance issues. Ensure that both target and caster parameters
    are valid before calling this method to avoid crashes or undefined behavior.
