api:
  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: GetMarketMetrics
  signature: MarketMetrics MarketAnalysis::GetMarketMetrics(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves market metrics for a specified item ID from the auction house database.
  description: The GetMarketMetrics method fetches comprehensive market analysis data
    for a given item identifier. This includes information such as current average
    price, buyout price trends, number of active auctions, and other relevant market
    statistics. The method is typically used by game systems or scripts that require
    real-time or near-real-time market data to inform player decisions or automate
    trading behaviors. It accesses the auction house database to compile this information
    and returns it in a structured MarketMetrics object. The method assumes that the
    item ID corresponds to an actual item in the game's database and that the auction
    house system is properly initialized.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the item for which market metrics are requested.
      Must correspond to a valid item in the game database (typically found in the
      ItemTemplate table).
  returns: A MarketMetrics object containing detailed market statistics for the specified
    item, including average price, number of auctions, buyout trends, and other relevant
    data points. Returns an empty or default-initialized MarketMetrics object if no
    data is available for the given itemId.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MarketMetrics metrics = marketAnalysis.GetMarketMetrics(12345);\nif (metrics.AveragePrice\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Average Price: \" << metrics.AveragePrice << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 itemId = 67890;\nMarketMetrics metrics = marketAnalysis.GetMarketMetrics(itemId);\n\
      if (metrics.NumberOfAuctions > 0)\n{\n    float priceChange = (metrics.CurrentPrice\
      \ - metrics.AveragePrice) / metrics.AveragePrice * 100.0f;\n    if (priceChange\
      \ > 5.0f)\n        std::cout << \"Price significantly above average!\" << std::endl;\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"No active auctions for item \" << itemId << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries and could have performance implications
    if called frequently. It's recommended to cache results when possible. The method
    is likely thread-safe in a multi-threaded environment, but depends on the underlying
    auction house implementation. Market data is only as accurate as the current state
    of the auction house system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid itemId may result in undefined behavior
    or return unreliable data. Ensure that item IDs are validated before calling this
    method. The returned data may not reflect real-time market conditions due to caching
    or update intervals.
