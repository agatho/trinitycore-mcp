  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: FindSafestNearbyPosition
  signature: int ObstacleUtils::FindSafestNearbyPosition(const int & target, const
    int & obstacles, float searchRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Finds the safest nearby position relative to a target considering obstacles
    within a specified radius.
  description: The FindSafestNearbyPosition method calculates and returns the most
    secure location around a given target position, taking into account the presence
    of obstacles. It evaluates potential positions within the defined search radius
    and selects the one with the least obstruction or threat. This utility is commonly
    used in AI pathfinding and positioning logic to ensure units or objects are placed
    in safe locations. The method requires valid target and obstacle identifiers,
    and the search radius must be a positive value. The result represents an index
    or identifier for the calculated safest position.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Identifier for the target position or entity around which to search
      for a safe location. Must be a valid integer identifier.
  - name: obstacles
    description: Identifier for the set of obstacles or threat sources that affect
      positioning safety. Must be a valid integer identifier representing obstacle
      data.
  - name: searchRadius
    description: Maximum distance from the target within which to search for a safe
      position. Must be a positive floating-point value.
  returns: Returns an integer identifier corresponding to the safest nearby position
    found. A return value of -1 typically indicates failure or no valid position was
    found within the specified constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int safePosition = ObstacleUtils::FindSafestNearbyPosition(playerGUID, obstacleSetID,
      10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Invalid Return
    code: "int result = ObstacleUtils::FindSafestNearbyPosition(targetID, obstacleID,\
      \ 5.0f);\nif (result == -1) {\n    // Handle case where no safe position was\
      \ found\n    LOG_ERROR(\"No safe position available\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal calculations to evaluate positional safety,
    including obstacle avoidance and threat assessment. It may involve complex pathfinding
    or spatial analysis depending on the underlying implementation. Performance can
    be impacted by large numbers of obstacles or high search radii.
  warnings: Ensure that both target and obstacle identifiers are valid before calling
    this method; invalid identifiers may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    The method does not validate the input parameters beyond basic type checking,
    so callers should ensure data integrity.
