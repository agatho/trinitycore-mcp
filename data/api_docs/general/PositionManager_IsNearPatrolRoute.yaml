  method: IsNearPatrolRoute
  signature: bool PositionManager::IsNearPatrolRoute(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is near any patrol route.
  description: The IsNearPatrolRoute method determines whether a specified position
    is within a certain proximity threshold of any defined patrol route in the current
    map or instance. This functionality is commonly used by AI-controlled creatures
    to identify when they are approaching waypoints or areas of interest. The method
    evaluates the distance between the provided position and all known patrol points,
    returning true if the position falls within the configured nearness criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the patrol
      route system. This typically corresponds to a waypoint index or node ID used
      internally by the PositionManager to track patrol paths.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is considered near any patrol route,
    false otherwise. The exact distance threshold for 'near' is determined by internal
    configuration settings and may vary based on creature type or instance context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (positionManager.IsNearPatrolRoute(currentWaypoint)) {\n    // Trigger\
      \ event when near patrol route\n    creature->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Patrol Positions
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < totalWaypoints; ++i) {\n    if (positionManager.IsNearPatrolRoute(i))\
      \ {\n        // Perform action for nearby patrol point\n        HandlePatrolPointReached(i);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal caching of patrol route data and may not reflect
    real-time changes to patrol paths. It is recommended to call this method only
    when necessary for performance reasons, as it involves distance calculations against
    multiple patrol points.
  warnings: The parameter 'pos' should be validated before use to ensure it corresponds
    to a valid patrol waypoint index; otherwise, the behavior is undefined and may
    cause access violations or incorrect results.
