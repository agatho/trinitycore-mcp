  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: DetermineResponse
  signature: MechanicResponse MechanicAwareness::DetermineResponse(Player * bot, const
    MechanicInfo & mechanic)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the appropriate response for a given mechanic based on bot's awareness
    and behavior.
  description: The DetermineResponse method evaluates the provided MechanicInfo structure
    to decide how a bot should react when encountering a specific game mechanic. This
    method is part of the MechanicAwareness class, which handles AI decision-making
    related to various in-game mechanics such as stuns, roots, silences, and other
    debuffs. It considers the bot's current state, available abilities, and strategic
    context to return an appropriate MechanicResponse that guides the bot's behavior
    during encounters. The method is typically invoked by the AI system when a mechanic
    is detected or applied to the bot.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that needs to determine
      its response to the mechanic. Must not be null.
  - name: mechanic
    description: Reference to a MechanicInfo structure containing details about the
      mechanic that has been applied or detected. This includes information such as
      mechanic type, duration, and intensity.
  returns: Returns a MechanicResponse enum value indicating the bot's determined action
    plan for handling the mechanic. Possible values may include MECHANIC_RESPONSE_NONE,
    MECHANIC_RESPONSE_ESCAPE, MECHANIC_RESPONSE_CAST_SPELL, MECHANIC_RESPONSE_USE_ITEM,
    or other response types depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "MechanicResponse response = awareness.DetermineResponse(bot, mechanicInfo);\n\
      switch (response)\n{\n    case MECHANIC_RESPONSE_ESCAPE:\n        bot->MoveToEscapePosition();\n\
      \        break;\n    case MECHANIC_RESPONSE_CAST_SPELL:\n        bot->CastBestAvailableSpell();\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle other cases\n        break;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state handling
    code: "if (mechanicInfo.type == MECHANIC_STUN)\n{\n    MechanicResponse response\
      \ = awareness.DetermineResponse(playerBot, mechanicInfo);\n    if (response\
      \ == MECHANIC_RESPONSE_CAST_SPELL)\n    {\n        // Attempt to break the stun\
      \ with a spell\n        playerBot->TryBreakStunWithSpell();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during combat scenarios, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account. The implementation may cache certain
    mechanic information or use lookup tables to optimize repeated calls. Developers
    should ensure that the MechanicInfo passed to this method is valid and properly
    initialized before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is not null before passing it to this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. The method assumes
    that the MechanicInfo contains valid data about the mechanic being processed,
    including its type and duration.
