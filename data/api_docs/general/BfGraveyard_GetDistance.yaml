  class: BfGraveyard
  method: GetDistance
  signature: float BfGraveyard::GetDistance(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the graveyard's location
    and a specified player's current position.
  description: The GetDistance method computes the straight-line distance from the
    BfGraveyard's central location to the given player's current world coordinates.
    This calculation is typically used in battleground scenarios to determine proximity
    for objectives, respawn mechanics, or player engagement checks. The method performs
    a simple 3D distance calculation using the player's X, Y, and Z coordinates relative
    to the graveyard's position. It does not account for terrain height differences
    or pathfinding obstacles, focusing purely on geometric distance. This function
    is commonly invoked during battleground updates or player entry/exit logic to
    manage graveyard-based gameplay elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the Euclidean distance in yards between the
    graveyard's location and the player's current position. Returns 0.0f if the player
    pointer is invalid or null.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distance Check
    code: "float distance = graveyard->GetDistance(player);\nif (distance < 50.0f)\
      \ {\n    // Player is within 50 yards of the graveyard\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Distance for Objective Logic
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nBfGraveyard* graveyard =\
      \ ...; // Get graveyard reference\nfloat distance = graveyard->GetDistance(player);\n\
      if (distance <= 30.0f) {\n    // Player is close enough to capture or interact\
      \ with the graveyard\n    // Trigger relevant battleground logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct coordinate-based distance calculation without
    considering map boundaries or line-of-sight. It's designed for performance-critical
    scenarios where quick proximity checks are needed. The result is in world units
    (yards) and can be used directly for range-based comparisons or UI feedback.
  warnings: The method assumes valid player coordinates and will return 0.0f if the
    player pointer is null. Ensure that the player object is valid before calling
    this method to avoid incorrect distance calculations. This function should not
    be used for pathfinding or collision detection as it only calculates straight-line
    distance.
