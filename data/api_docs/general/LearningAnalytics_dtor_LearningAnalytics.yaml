  method: ~LearningAnalytics
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::~LearningAnalytics()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LearningAnalytics instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~LearningAnalytics destructor is responsible for cleaning up any
    dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the LearningAnalytics class
    instance. This method is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's learning analytics system,
    this destructor ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures and prevents
    memory leaks. The method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of LearningAnalytics object
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    LearningAnalytics analytics;\n    // ... use\
      \ analytics ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when analytics goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of LearningAnalytics object
    code: 'LearningAnalytics* analytics = new LearningAnalytics();

      // ... use analytics ...

      delete analytics; // Triggers destructor

      analytics = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects are destroyed.
    Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless implementing custom memory
    management patterns. The LearningAnalytics class likely manages internal data
    structures that require cleanup, such as buffers, caches, or statistical accumulators.
  warnings: Do not manually call this destructor unless you're implementing a custom
    memory management system. Avoid calling the destructor on objects that are still
    in use or referenced elsewhere in the codebase.
