documentation:
  brief: Returns the progress of the quest in terms of POI (Point of Interest) coordinates
  description: This method retrieves the current progress of a quest as a float value
    representing the Point of Interest coordinates. The method is typically used to
    determine the current position or state of a quest within the game world, particularly
    when dealing with quest objectives that involve specific locations or coordinates.
    It provides a way to access the quest's progress data without requiring additional
    calculations or conversions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the POI coordinate progress of the quest.
    This value typically corresponds to the current x-coordinate of the quest's objective
    location, with values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating the progress towards
    completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float progress = quest->GetPOIx();\nif (progress > 0.0f) {\n    // Quest\
      \ is progressing\n}\nelse {\n    // Quest has completed or is not progressing\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods for comprehensive quest tracking. The returned
    value represents a normalized coordinate, which may vary depending on how the
    quest objectives are defined in the game world.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns a float value, which may not accurately
    represent exact coordinates in some cases. Also note that this method does not
    provide information about the y-coordinate or z-coordinate of the quest objective.
