  method: GetActivePriority
  signature: BehaviorPriority BehaviorPriorityManager::GetActivePriority() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the currently active behavior priority from the BehaviorPriorityManager.
  description: The GetActivePriority method returns the BehaviorPriority that is currently
    considered active within the BehaviorPriorityManager. This priority typically
    determines the order in which behaviors are evaluated or executed by the AI system.
    The returned value represents the highest-priority behavior that is currently
    valid and enabled, according to the manager's internal logic. This method does
    not modify any state within the manager but simply reads and returns the current
    active priority level.
  parameters: []
  returns: The BehaviorPriority representing the currently active priority level.
    The specific value depends on the implementation details of how priorities are
    managed and assigned within the BehaviorPriorityManager.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BehaviorPriority currentPriority = behaviorManager.GetActivePriority();\n\
      if (currentPriority == BehaviorPriority::HIGH)\n{\n    // Handle high priority\
      \ behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making cycles to determine
    which behavior should be prioritized. It's important to note that the returned
    value may change dynamically as conditions in the AI system evolve.
