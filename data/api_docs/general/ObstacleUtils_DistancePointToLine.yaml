  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: DistancePointToLine
  signature: float ObstacleUtils::DistancePointToLine(const int & point, const int
    & lineStart, const int & lineEnd)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the shortest distance from a point to a line segment in 3D space.
  description: The DistancePointToLine method computes the Euclidean distance between
    a given point and the closest point on a line segment defined by two endpoints.
    This utility is commonly used in pathfinding, collision detection, and AI behavior
    calculations within the TrinityCore framework. The method handles edge cases such
    as when the closest point on the line segment lies beyond its endpoints, ensuring
    accurate distance measurements even for degenerate cases. It operates on integer
    coordinates and returns a floating-point result representing the actual distance.
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: The coordinate of the point from which to measure the distance. This
      parameter represents the x-coordinate of the point in 3D space.
  - name: lineStart
    description: The starting coordinate of the line segment. This parameter represents
      the x-coordinate of the line's start point in 3D space.
  - name: lineEnd
    description: The ending coordinate of the line segment. This parameter represents
      the x-coordinate of the line's end point in 3D space.
  returns: A float value representing the shortest Euclidean distance from the specified
    point to the line segment defined by lineStart and lineEnd. Returns zero if the
    point lies exactly on the line segment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating distance between a point and a line
    code: float distance = ObstacleUtils::DistancePointToLine(10, 5, 15); // Calculates
      distance from point 10 to line from 5 to 15
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes all parameters are integer coordinates representing positions
    along a single axis (likely X-axis in 3D space). The implementation may involve
    vector mathematics or geometric calculations internally. Performance is generally
    efficient for single calculations but could become a bottleneck if called frequently
    in tight loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the lineStart and lineEnd parameters define a valid line segment;
    otherwise, results may be undefined. When working with 3D coordinates, this method
    only operates on one axis (presumably X), so multiple calls might be needed for
    full 3D distance calculations.
