  method: IsItemTypeUsefulForClass
  signature: bool LootDistribution::IsItemTypeUsefulForClass(uint8 playerClass, const
    ItemTemplate * itemTemplate)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific item type is useful for a given player class
    in the context of loot distribution.
  description: The IsItemTypeUsefulForClass method evaluates if an item template is
    beneficial for a particular player class based on game mechanics and item usability.
    This function is typically used during loot distribution to filter out items that
    would not be useful or relevant to a specific class, thereby improving the efficiency
    and fairness of loot allocation. The method considers factors such as class restrictions,
    item types (like weapon types, armor classes), and other game-specific rules that
    determine item usefulness. It returns true if the item is considered useful for
    the specified class, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: The class identifier of the player (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_MAGE).
      Must be a valid class enum value from the TrinityCore player class definitions.
  - name: itemTemplate
    description: Pointer to the ItemTemplate structure that defines the properties
      and characteristics of the item being evaluated. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the item is considered useful for the specified player
    class, false otherwise. An item may be deemed not useful if it's restricted to
    another class or incompatible with the player's role.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a weapon is useful for a Warrior
    code: "ItemTemplate* sword = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nbool isUseful\
      \ = LootDistribution::IsItemTypeUsefulForClass(CLASS_WARRIOR, sword);\nif (isUseful)\n\
      \    printf(\"Sword is useful for Warriors\\n\");"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filter loot items for a Mage's class
    code: "for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_CLASSES; ++i)\n{\n    ItemTemplate* item = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(54321);\n\
      \    if (LootDistribution::IsItemTypeUsefulForClass(i, item))\n        printf(\"\
      Item is useful for class %d\\n\", i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal class restrictions and item type mappings
    to determine usefulness. It may be called frequently during loot distribution
    processes, so performance is important. The implementation might cache results
    or use fast lookup tables for efficiency.
  warnings: Ensure that the ItemTemplate pointer passed is valid and not null, as
    passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, make sure the playerClass
    value corresponds to a valid class enum from TrinityCore's class definitions.
