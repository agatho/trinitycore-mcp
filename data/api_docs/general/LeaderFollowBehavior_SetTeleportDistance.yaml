  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: SetTeleportDistance
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::SetTeleportDistance(float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the teleport distance threshold for the leader-follow behavior.
  description: The SetTeleportDistance method configures the maximum distance at which
    a follower will teleport to the leader when they become separated. This parameter
    controls the AI's decision-making process for maintaining group cohesion during
    movement. When a follower detects that it has moved beyond this specified distance
    from the leader, it will initiate a teleportation action to reposition itself
    near the leader. The value is typically expressed in yards and affects the behavior
    of NPC followers in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Teleport Distance for Group Follow
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = new LeaderFollowBehavior();

      behavior->SetTeleportDistance(20.0f);

      // Follower will teleport to leader if distance exceeds 20 yards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Teleport Distance for Large Groups
    code: "if (player->GetGroup())\n{\n    for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator\
      \ itr = player->GetGroup()->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n         itr != player->GetGroup()->GetMemberSlots().end();\
      \ ++itr)\n    {\n        if (Player* member = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid))\n\
      \        {\n            if (Creature* follower = member->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(member,\
      \ UNIT_NPC_FLAG_GOSSIP))\n            {\n                if (follower->AI())\n\
      \                {\n                    if (LeaderFollowBehavior* lfb = dynamic_cast<LeaderFollowBehavior*>(follower->AI()))\n\
      \                    {\n                        lfb->SetTeleportDistance(30.0f);\n\
      \                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the AI's pathfinding and movement decisions
    for followers. The teleport distance should be set considering the map size and
    gameplay balance to prevent excessive teleportation that could disrupt player
    experience or cause performance issues. Values below 5.0f may result in frequent,
    unnecessary teleports.
  warnings: Setting very large teleport distances (above 100 yards) may cause followers
    to teleport across large maps, potentially leading to visual glitches or unexpected
    behavior. This method should not be called during active combat situations as
    it might interfere with the AI's current state and decision-making process.
