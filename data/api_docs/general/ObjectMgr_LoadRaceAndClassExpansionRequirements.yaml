documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes race and class expansion requirements from the database.
  description: This method populates internal data structures with expansion requirements
    for player races and classes. It retrieves data from the database tables that
    define which expansions each race and class is available in, ensuring that game
    mechanics such as character creation, level restrictions, and content availability
    are properly enforced based on expansion settings. The method is typically called
    during server startup or database loading phases to ensure all expansion requirements
    are correctly loaded into memory for runtime use.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadRaceAndClassExpansionRequirements();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server initialization and should not
    be called repeatedly during runtime. It relies on the database being properly
    populated with expansion requirement data for all races and classes.
  warnings: Calling this method after the server has started may cause inconsistencies
    in player data or unexpected behavior related to expansion restrictions. Ensure
    that database tables containing expansion requirements are correctly updated before
    invoking this method.
