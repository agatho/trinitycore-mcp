  class: GatheringManager
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const GatheringStatistics & GatheringManager::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the gathering statistics object for the current
    instance.
  description: The GetStatistics method provides access to the internal gathering
    statistics data structure, which tracks various metrics related to resource gathering
    activities within the game. This includes information such as total items gathered,
    successful vs failed attempts, and other relevant performance indicators. The
    returned reference is constant, meaning that modifications to the statistics are
    not allowed through this interface, ensuring data integrity. This method is typically
    used for monitoring player activity, generating reports, or displaying gathering
    progress in user interfaces.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a GatheringStatistics object containing all gathered
    metrics and counters related to resource collection activities.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Gathering Statistics
    code: 'const GatheringStatistics& stats = gatheringManager.GetStatistics();

      uint32 totalGathered = stats.TotalItemsGathered();

      uint32 successRate = stats.SuccessRate();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Displaying Player Gathering Progress
    code: "void DisplayGatheringProgress(GatheringManager& manager) {\n    const GatheringStatistics&\
      \ stats = manager.GetStatistics();\n    std::cout << \"Total Items Gathered:\
      \ \" << stats.TotalItemsGathered() << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Success\
      \ Rate: \" << stats.SuccessRate() << \"%\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data managed by the GatheringManager
    instance. Modifications to the statistics should be performed through dedicated
    setter methods or internal update mechanisms rather than direct access. This method
    is thread-safe as long as no concurrent modifications occur to the underlying
    statistics object.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned GatheringStatistics object directly
    through the reference, as it's const. Any changes must be made through appropriate
    interfaces or methods provided by the GatheringManager class. The statistics may
    be updated asynchronously during gameplay.
