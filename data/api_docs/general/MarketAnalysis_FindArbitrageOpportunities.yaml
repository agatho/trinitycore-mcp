  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: FindArbitrageOpportunities
  signature: int MarketAnalysis::FindArbitrageOpportunities()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market data to identify potential arbitrage opportunities between
    different auction houses.
  description: The FindArbitrageOpportunities method scans through available auction
    house items and compares their prices across multiple realms or servers to detect
    profitable arbitrage scenarios. It evaluates buyout prices, bid amounts, and item
    availability to determine if an item can be purchased at a lower price on one
    auction house and sold at a higher price on another. This method is typically
    used by automated trading systems or market analysis tools within the TrinityCore
    framework to optimize in-game economic strategies. The method requires access
    to auction house data and assumes that cross-realm market information is available
    for comparison.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of arbitrage opportunities found.
    A return value of zero indicates no profitable opportunities were detected, while
    positive integers indicate the count of valid arbitrage scenarios identified.
    Negative values may indicate internal errors or invalid data states during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Arbitrage Analysis
    code: "MarketAnalysis analyzer;\nint opportunities = analyzer.FindArbitrageOpportunities();\n\
      if (opportunities > 0) {\n    printf(\"Found %d arbitrage opportunities\\n\"\
      , opportunities);\n} else if (opportunities == 0) {\n    printf(\"No arbitrage\
      \ opportunities detected\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Error occurred during\
      \ analysis\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may require significant computational resources when analyzing
    large datasets of auction house items. Performance can be affected by the number
    of items in the auction house and the complexity of price comparisons. The method
    should only be called when sufficient market data is available to avoid false
    positives or incomplete results.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of auction house data
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect findings. It's recommended to validate
    that all required market information is loaded before execution. Additionally,
    frequent calls to this method might impact server performance and should be rate-limited
    in production environments.
