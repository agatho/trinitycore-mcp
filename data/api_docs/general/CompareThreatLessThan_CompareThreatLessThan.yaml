  class: CompareThreatLessThan
  method: CompareThreatLessThan
  signature: void CompareThreatLessThan::CompareThreatLessThan()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a threat comparison object for evaluating mob aggro levels in
    combat.
  description: The CompareThreatLessThan class constructor initializes a threat comparison
    utility used within TrinityCore's AI system to determine if one creature's threat
    level is less than another's. This functionality is essential for managing mob
    targeting behavior and ensuring proper aggro mechanics during combat encounters.
    The class likely implements a comparison functor or predicate that can be used
    with STL algorithms or sorting functions to order creatures by their current threat
    values. It operates within the context of the World of Warcraft AI framework where
    threat generation and management directly impacts gameplay balance and encounter
    difficulty.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "void ExampleAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    CompareThreatLessThan threatComparator;\n\
      \    // Use threatComparator with std::sort or similar algorithms\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is typically used internally by the AI subsystem and may not be
    directly instantiated by external code. The implementation likely relies on creature-specific
    threat tables and current target information stored within the mob's AI context.
  warnings: Do not instantiate this class directly unless you are working within the
    core AI framework. Improper usage could lead to incorrect aggro behavior or performance
    issues in combat scenarios.
