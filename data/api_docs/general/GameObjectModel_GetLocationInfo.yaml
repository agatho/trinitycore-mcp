  class: GameObjectModel
  method: GetLocationInfo
  signature: bool GameObjectModel::GetLocationInfo(const int & point, VMAP::LocationInfo
    & info, const PhaseShift & phaseShift) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves location information for a specified point within the game object
    model.
  description: The GetLocationInfo method retrieves detailed location information
    for a given point within the GameObjectModel. It uses the provided point index
    and phase shift to determine the corresponding location data, which includes information
    about terrain height, area flags, and other spatial properties. This method is
    essential for collision detection, line-of-sight calculations, and determining
    valid positions for game entities within the model's bounds. The method returns
    true if the location information was successfully retrieved, or false if the point
    index is invalid or out of bounds.
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: An integer reference representing the index of the point within the
      GameObjectModel for which location information is requested. This index typically
      corresponds to a specific vertex or position in the model's geometry.
  - name: info
    description: A reference to a VMAP::LocationInfo object that will be populated
      with the retrieved location data. This includes properties such as height, area
      flags, and other spatial characteristics of the specified point.
  - name: phaseShift
    description: A const reference to a PhaseShift object that determines the phase
      state for which the location information should be retrieved. This is important
      for handling phased environments where different parts of the world are visible
      to players in different phases.
  returns: Returns true if the location information was successfully retrieved for
    the specified point and phase, or false if the point index is invalid, out of
    bounds, or if the location data could not be determined due to missing or corrupted
    model data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetLocationInfo
    code: "GameObjectModel* model = ...; // Assume model is initialized\nVMAP::LocationInfo\
      \ info;\nPhaseShift phaseShift;\nint pointIndex = 5;\n\nif (model->GetLocationInfo(pointIndex,\
      \ info, phaseShift)) {\n    // Successfully retrieved location info\n    printf(\"\
      Height: %f\\n\", info.height);\n    printf(\"Area flags: %u\\n\", info.areaflags);\n\
      } else {\n    // Failed to retrieve location info\n    printf(\"Invalid point\
      \ index or no data available\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying VMAP (Virtual Map) system for accurate
    location information. The phaseShift parameter is crucial when working with phased
    environments, as it ensures that the returned location data reflects the correct
    state of the world for the given player's phase. Performance may be impacted if
    called frequently in tight loops without caching results.
  warnings: Ensure that the point index passed to this method is within valid bounds
    of the GameObjectModel's geometry, otherwise the method will return false and
    the info structure may contain undefined values. Also, improper handling of PhaseShift
    can lead to incorrect location data being returned for phased environments.
