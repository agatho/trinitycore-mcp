  signature: void QuestTurnIn::BatchTurnInOperations()
documentation:
  brief: Processes multiple quest turn-in operations in a single batch for improved
    performance and efficiency.
  description: The BatchTurnInOperations method handles the processing of multiple
    quest completion actions simultaneously, reducing overhead by minimizing individual
    database transactions and network calls. This method is typically invoked when
    a player has completed several quests at once, allowing the server to efficiently
    update quest progress, reward players, and handle related quest data in one consolidated
    operation rather than processing each turn-in individually. The method ensures
    that all quest-related updates are consistent and atomic within the scope of the
    batch.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      questTurnIn.BatchTurnInOperations();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is optimized for performance and should be used instead of individual
    turn-in operations when processing multiple quests. It assumes that all relevant
    quest data has been properly validated before invocation.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper pre-validation may result in inconsistent
    quest states or data corruption. Ensure all quests being turned in are valid and
    eligible for completion before invoking this function.
