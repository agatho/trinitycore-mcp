  class: AuctionEvent
  method: CommandResult
  signature: AuctionEvent AuctionEvent::CommandResult(int playerGuid, uint32 auctionId,
    uint32 command, uint32 errorCode)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new AuctionEvent object representing a command result
    for an auction.
  description: The CommandResult method is used to generate an AuctionEvent instance
    that represents the outcome of a command executed on an auction item. This method
    is typically invoked when processing auction-related commands such as bidding,
    canceling, or purchasing items. The returned AuctionEvent encapsulates the player
    GUID, auction ID, command type, and error code associated with the operation.
    It serves as a standardized way to communicate auction command results within
    the TrinityCore auction system, enabling proper event handling and logging throughout
    the game's auction mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who executed the auction
      command. This value identifies which user performed the action.
  - name: auctionId
    description: The unique identifier of the auction item that the command was applied
      to. This corresponds to the specific auction entry in the database.
  - name: command
    description: The type of auction command that was executed. Valid values typically
      include constants like AUCTION_BID, AUCTION_CANCEL, or AUCTION_PURCHASE representing
      different auction actions.
  - name: errorCode
    description: An error code indicating the success or failure of the auction command
      execution. Zero usually indicates success, while non-zero values represent specific
      error conditions such as insufficient funds, invalid auction state, or permission
      denied.
  returns: Returns a new AuctionEvent object containing all the provided parameters
    and representing the result of an auction command execution. The returned object
    can be used for event propagation, logging, or further processing within the auction
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Command Result
    code: 'AuctionEvent event = AuctionEvent::CommandResult(12345, 67890, AUCTION_BID,
      0);

      // Creates an event indicating a successful bid on auction ID 67890 by player
      12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Failed Auction Command Result
    code: 'AuctionEvent event = AuctionEvent::CommandResult(54321, 98765, AUCTION_PURCHASE,
      10);

      // Creates an event indicating a failed purchase on auction ID 98765 by player
      54321 with error code 10 (e.g., insufficient funds)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's auction system and should only be
    called when processing actual auction commands. The returned AuctionEvent object
    should be properly handled by the event system to ensure correct game state updates
    and user feedback. The method does not perform any database operations itself;
    it merely constructs an event object for further use.
  warnings: Ensure that the command parameter corresponds to valid auction command
    constants, as invalid values may lead to unexpected behavior in the auction system.
    The error code should be carefully chosen to accurately reflect the outcome of
    the command execution to maintain proper game state consistency.
