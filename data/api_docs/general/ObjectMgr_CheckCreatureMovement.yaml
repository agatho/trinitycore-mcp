  class: ObjectMgr
  method: CheckCreatureMovement
  signature: void ObjectMgr::CheckCreatureMovement(const char * table, uint64 id,
    int & creatureMovement)
documentation:
  brief: Checks and validates creature movement data for a specified creature in the
    database.
  description: The CheckCreatureMovement method performs validation on creature movement
    data stored in the specified database table for a given creature ID. It ensures
    that movement-related entries are consistent and properly formatted, preventing
    invalid or corrupted movement data from affecting game mechanics. This method
    is typically used during server startup or when loading creature data to maintain
    data integrity. The method modifies the provided integer reference to indicate
    the result of the validation check.
  parameters:
  - name: table
    description: A null-terminated string specifying the database table name containing
      creature movement data. Common values include 'creature_movement', 'creature_movement_template',
      or related movement tables.
  - name: id
    description: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier (GUID)
      of the creature to validate. This is typically the creature's database entry
      ID used to locate specific movement records.
  - name: creatureMovement
    description: A reference to an integer that will be updated with the validation
      result. The value indicates whether the movement data passed validation (typically
      0 or positive) or failed (negative value).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CheckCreatureMovement
    code: "uint64 creatureGuid = 12345;\nint movementResult = 0;\nObjectMgr::CheckCreatureMovement(\"\
      creature_movement\", creatureGuid, movementResult);\nif (movementResult < 0)\
      \ {\n    // Handle invalid movement data\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid movement\
      \ data for creature %u\", creatureGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking movement data during server initialization
    code: "void LoadCreatureMovementData() {\n    QueryResult result = WorldDatabase.Query(\"\
      SELECT id FROM creature WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM creature_movement)\");\n\
      \    if (!result) return;\n    \n    do {\n        Field* fields = result->Fetch();\n\
      \        uint64 creatureId = fields[0].GetUInt64();\n        int movementStatus\
      \ = 0;\n        sObjectMgr->CheckCreatureMovement(\"creature_movement\", creatureId,\
      \ movementStatus);\n        if (movementStatus < 0) {\n            sLog->outError(\"\
      Movement validation failed for creature %u\", creatureId);\n        }\n    }\
      \ while (result->NextRow());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during server initialization or data loading
    phases to ensure that creature movement data is valid before being used in gameplay.
    It may perform database queries and should be called with appropriate thread safety
    considerations. The validation logic might vary depending on the table type and
    specific game mechanics implemented.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper database connection or with invalid
    table names can lead to assertion failures or undefined behavior. Ensure that
    the creature ID exists in the database before calling this method, as it may not
    handle non-existent creatures gracefully.
