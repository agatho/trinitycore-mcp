documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GameObjectModel instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GameObjectModel class is responsible for cleaning
    up all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    releasing any internal data structures, freeing memory pools, and ensuring that
    no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, GameObjectModel represents a collision model for game objects
    such as doors, furniture, or environmental elements. The destructor ensures proper
    cleanup when these models are removed from the game world or when the server shuts
    down. It is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of GameObjectModel
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    GameObjectModel* model = new GameObjectModel();\n\
      \    // ... use the model ...\n    delete model; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-allocated GameObjectModel destruction
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    GameObjectModel model;\n    // ... use the\
      \ model ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when model goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of memory management in TrinityCore. It
    ensures that all resources associated with a GameObjectModel are properly released,
    preventing memory leaks and maintaining server stability. Since this is a low-level
    system component, developers should not manually invoke the destructor unless
    they have specific requirements for object lifecycle management.
