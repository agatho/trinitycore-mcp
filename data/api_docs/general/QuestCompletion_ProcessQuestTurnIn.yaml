  class: QuestCompletion
  method: ProcessQuestTurnIn
  signature: void QuestCompletion::ProcessQuestTurnIn(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the turn-in of a quest for a player character, handling rewards
    and quest completion logic.
  description: The ProcessQuestTurnIn method is responsible for managing the completion
    of a quest by a player character in the TrinityCore framework. It handles the
    necessary game mechanics such as awarding quest rewards, updating quest progress,
    and triggering any associated quest events or objectives. This method typically
    gets invoked when a player successfully completes a quest and submits it to the
    quest giver. The method ensures that all quest-related data is properly updated
    within the player's quest log and that appropriate in-game actions are taken based
    on the quest's completion.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who is turning
      in the quest. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid player
      instance.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being turned in. This value must
      correspond to a valid quest entry in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestCompletion::ProcessQuestTurnIn(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Turn-In
    code: "if (player->GetQuestStatus(questId) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n    QuestCompletion::ProcessQuestTurnIn(player,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already met all prerequisites for
    quest completion. The implementation internally calls various subsystems to handle
    rewards, experience distribution, item giving, and quest log updates. It is recommended
    to verify quest status before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid questId or null player pointer may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the quest has been properly
    completed and validated before invoking this function.
