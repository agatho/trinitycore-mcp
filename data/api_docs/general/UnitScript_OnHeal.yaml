  class: UnitScript
  method: OnHeal
  signature: void UnitScript::OnHeal(Unit * healer, Unit * reciever, uint32 & gain)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a unit heals another unit, allowing scripts to modify or react
    to the healing event.
  description: The OnHeal method is a virtual callback function in the UnitScript
    class that gets triggered whenever a unit performs a healing action on another
    unit. This method provides an opportunity for custom scripts or addons to intercept
    and modify the healing process. The method receives references to both the healer
    and the healed unit, as well as a reference to the healing amount which can be
    modified by the script. It is commonly used in custom AI implementations, quest
    systems, or game mechanics that require special handling of healing events.
  parameters:
  - name: healer
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is performing the heal action. This
      represents the source of the healing.
  - name: reciever
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is receiving the heal. This represents
      the target of the healing.
  - name: gain
    description: Reference to a uint32 value representing the amount of health being
      restored. This value can be modified by the script to change the actual healing
      amount.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Modification
    code: "class MyUnitScript : public UnitScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnHeal(Unit*\
      \ healer, Unit* reciever, uint32& gain) override\n    {\n        // Double the\
      \ healing amount\n        gain *= 2;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Healing Reduction
    code: "class MyUnitScript : public UnitScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnHeal(Unit*\
      \ healer, Unit* reciever, uint32& gain) override\n    {\n        // Reduce healing\
      \ by 50% if the target is a player\n        if (reciever->IsPlayer())\n    \
      \        gain /= 2;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the healing process, so modifications to the
    'gain' parameter will directly affect the final healing amount. Be cautious when
    modifying healing values as it can significantly impact gameplay balance and player
    experience.
  warnings: Modifying the healing amount can have unintended consequences on game
    mechanics and player progression. Ensure that any changes made to the 'gain' parameter
    are within reasonable bounds to maintain game balance.
