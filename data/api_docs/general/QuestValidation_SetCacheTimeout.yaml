  class: QuestValidation
  method: SetCacheTimeout
  signature: void QuestValidation::SetCacheTimeout(uint32 timeoutMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cache timeout value for quest validation in milliseconds.
  description: The SetCacheTimeout method configures the duration that cached quest
    validation data remains valid before it must be refreshed. This is used internally
    by the QuestValidation system to manage performance and ensure quest data consistency.
    The timeout value determines how frequently the server will revalidate quest requirements
    and states, balancing between responsiveness and server load. Setting this value
    too low may increase server overhead due to frequent validations, while setting
    it too high might cause stale quest data to be presented to players.
  parameters:
  - name: timeoutMs
    description: The timeout duration in milliseconds for the quest validation cache.
      Valid values are positive integers representing time intervals. Typical values
      range from a few seconds to several minutes depending on desired performance
      characteristics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Cache Timeout to 30 Seconds
    code: QuestValidation::SetCacheTimeout(30000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Cache Timeout Based on Server Load
    code: 'uint32 cacheTimeout = sWorld->getIntConfig(CONFIG_QUEST_VALIDATION_CACHE_TIMEOUT_MS);

      QuestValidation::SetCacheTimeout(cacheTimeout);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the global quest validation cache behavior across all
    players. The cache timeout value should be tuned based on server performance requirements
    and quest update frequency. Changes to this setting take effect immediately for
    subsequent cache operations.
  warnings: Modifying the cache timeout during active gameplay may cause inconsistent
    quest states for players currently engaged with quests. Ensure this method is
    called before normal server operation begins or during maintenance windows.
