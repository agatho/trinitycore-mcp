documentation:
  brief: Compares two GameObjectAssistActionData objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a lexicographical comparison between
    this GameObjectAssistActionData object and another provided object. It returns
    true if any of the member variables differ between the two objects, and false
    if all member variables are equal. This comparison is typically used to determine
    whether two game object assist action data structures represent different configurations
    or states. The method is const, meaning it does not modify either object during
    the comparison operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the two GameObjectAssistActionData objects are not equal
    (i.e., at least one member variable differs), and false if they are equal (all
    member variables are identical).
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check between two GameObjectAssistActionData objects
    code: 'GameObjectAssistActionData data1;

      GameObjectAssistActionData data2;

      bool result = (data1 != data2); // Returns true if data1 and data2 differ in
      any member

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using inequality operator to detect configuration changes in game objects
    code: "GameObjectAssistActionData oldData = GetGameObjectAssistData();\n// ...\
      \ some operations that may modify the data ...\nGameObjectAssistActionData newData\
      \ = GetGameObjectAssistData();\nif (oldData != newData) {\n    // Handle the\
      \ case where assist action data has changed\n    UpdateGameObjectAssistBehavior();\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely relies on member-wise comparison of all fields in the
    GameObjectAssistActionData structure. It's important to ensure that all member
    variables have properly defined equality operators for consistent behavior. The
    comparison is typically efficient as it stops at the first differing field.
