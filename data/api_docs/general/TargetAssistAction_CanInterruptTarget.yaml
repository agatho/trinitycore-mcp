  signature: bool TargetAssistAction::CanInterruptTarget(Player * bot, Unit * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot can interrupt the target's current spell casting.
  description: The CanInterruptTarget method evaluates if a bot character is capable
    of interrupting an enemy unit's ongoing spell cast. This functionality is crucial
    for AI behavior in TrinityCore's combat system, particularly when deciding whether
    to use abilities like Silenced or Interrupt spells. The method considers factors
    such as the target's current casting state, the bot's available interrupt abilities,
    and the proximity between the bot and target. It returns true if the interruption
    is possible based on game mechanics and AI rules, otherwise false.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI-controlled character
      that may perform the interruption.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the enemy target whose spell
      casting might be interrupted.
  returns: Returns true if the bot can successfully interrupt the target's current
    spell cast, false otherwise. This decision is based on game rules such as spell
    type, distance, and available abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (action->CanInterruptTarget(bot, target)) {\n    bot->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_INTERRUPT, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with TargetAssistAction Logic
    code: "class TargetAssistAction {\npublic:\n    bool CanInterruptTarget(Player*\
      \ bot, Unit* target) const {\n        if (!target || !target->IsInCombat())\n\
      \            return false;\n        \n        if (target->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \            return true;\n        \n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within AI decision-making loops to determine
    appropriate actions during combat. The implementation may vary depending on the
    specific AI module and bot behavior configuration. Performance-wise, this check
    should be lightweight as it's called frequently during combat updates.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid null pointer dereferences. Be aware that some spell types cannot
    be interrupted regardless of conditions, and the method may not account for all
    edge cases in custom AI implementations.
