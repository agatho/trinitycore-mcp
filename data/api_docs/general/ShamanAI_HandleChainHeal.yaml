  method: HandleChainHeal
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleChainHeal()
documentation:
  brief: Performs a chain heal spell cast on nearby friendly targets within range
  description: The HandleChainHeal method executes the Shaman's Chain Heal ability,
    which heals the casting Shaman and up to three nearby friendly targets in a chain-like
    pattern. This method determines whether the spell can be cast based on available
    mana, target validity, and spell restrictions. It prioritizes healing targets
    with the lowest health percentage within the spell's range, ensuring optimal resource
    usage for the shaman's healing capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the chain heal was successfully initiated or if no valid
    targets were found to cast upon; returns false if the spell failed due to insufficient
    mana, invalid targets, or other casting restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chain Heal Usage
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandleChainHeal()) {\n    // Chain heal successfully executed\
      \ or no valid targets\n    // Continue with AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the Shaman's AI decision-making process
    when healing is prioritized. The spell follows standard World of Warcraft Chain
    Heal mechanics, where the heal jumps to targets within 10 yards, with diminishing
    returns on damage dealt to subsequent targets.
  warnings: The method assumes that the shaman has sufficient mana and valid targets
    before attempting to cast. If called in an environment without proper AI context
    or target management, it may fail silently or cause unexpected behavior.
