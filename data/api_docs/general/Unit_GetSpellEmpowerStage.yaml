documentation:
  brief: Returns the stage of spell empowerment for the unit
  description: This method retrieves the current spell empowerment stage value for
    the specified unit. The stage represents the level of empowerment that a spell
    has reached, typically used in conjunction with spell power mechanics and progression
    systems within TrinityCore. It is commonly employed to determine how much power
    or influence a spell has accumulated during its casting process or when it reaches
    certain milestones. This method does not require any parameters and returns an
    integer value indicating the stage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int8 value representing the current spell empowerment stage,
    which can range from 0 to 255 depending on the implementation and context of the
    spell being empowered. A value of 0 indicates no empowerment, while higher values
    represent increasing stages of empowerment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: Unit* target = GetSpellEmpowerStage();
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Unit class and likely used in conjunction with
    other spell-related functions. Implementation details may vary depending on how
    spell empowerment is tracked internally within TrinityCore. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this is a simple getter function.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without understanding the context
    of spell empowerment stages, as incorrect usage could lead to unexpected behavior
    in spell mechanics or progression systems.
