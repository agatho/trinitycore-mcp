documentation:
  brief: Prepares spell data for trigger system execution by setting up necessary
    context and state information.
  description: The prepareDataForTriggerSystem method initializes and configures internal
    spell data structures required for the trigger system to properly process spell
    effects. This method ensures that all relevant spell parameters, targets, and
    contextual information are correctly set before a spell's trigger logic is executed.
    It typically handles preparation of target lists, calculation of spell modifiers,
    and setup of any temporary data needed for trigger evaluation. The method is called
    internally during the spell execution flow and should not be invoked directly
    by external code unless specifically required for custom spell behavior implementations.

  - title: Internal usage in spell execution
    code: "void Spell::Execute()\n{\n    prepareDataForTriggerSystem();\n    // Continue\
      \ with trigger system execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell execution pipeline and should not
    be called manually unless implementing custom spell behavior. It modifies internal
    spell state and prepares data structures that are expected to be in a specific
    format for subsequent trigger processing steps.
