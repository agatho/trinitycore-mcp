  method: ShareGroupQuests
  signature: void QuestManager::ShareGroupQuests()
documentation:
  brief: Shares available group quests from one player to all other group members.
  description: The ShareGroupQuests method distributes active or available quest information
    from a player's quest log to all other members of their current group. This functionality
    ensures that group members are aware of shared quests they can accept and complete
    together. The method typically operates within the context of a player's quest
    management system, automatically propagating quest data across group members when
    certain conditions are met, such as quest acceptance or group formation. It is
    commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to maintain
    synchronization of group quest progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Acceptance
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest)\n{\n    // ... other quest\
      \ acceptance logic ...\n    GetGroup()->GetQuestManager().ShareGroupQuests();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically when a player accepts a quest
    that can be shared with group members. It relies on the internal quest sharing
    mechanism and requires the player to be in a valid group. The implementation may
    include checks for quest sharing eligibility and group member availability.
  warnings: Improper use of this method outside of appropriate quest context may cause
    synchronization issues or unexpected behavior in group quest progression. Ensure
    that players are properly grouped before invoking this method.
