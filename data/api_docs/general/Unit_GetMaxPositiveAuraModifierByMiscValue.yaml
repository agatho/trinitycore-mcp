  method: GetMaxPositiveAuraModifierByMiscValue
  signature: int32 Unit::GetMaxPositiveAuraModifierByMiscValue(int auraType, int32
    misc_value) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum positive aura modifier value for a given aura type and
    misc value.
  description: This method retrieves the highest positive modifier value from all
    active auras of a specified type that match a given misc value. It is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft mechanics to determine bonuses or effects from buffs
    sources. The method examines the unit's aura list and returns the maximum value
    among all matching positive modifiers, which can be useful for calculating various
    game mechanics such as spell damage bonuses, critical chance modifiers, or other
    stat enhancements. This function is particularly important when dealing with aura
    effects that modify specific attributes like spell power, attack power, or critical
    strike chance.
  parameters:
  - name: auraType
    description: The type of aura to search for (e.g., SPELL_AURA_MODIFY_SPELL_POWER,
      SPELL_AURA_MOD_ATTACK_POWER). Valid values are typically defined by the SpellAuraType
      enum.
  - name: misc_value
    description: The specific value to match against the aura's misc value. This could
      be a spell ID, stat type, or other value depending on the context of the aura
      being examined.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the maximum positive modifier value found
    among all matching auras. If no matching positive aura is found, returns 0. Negative
    values are ignored as this method specifically searches for positive modifiers
    only.
  examples:
  - title: Finding spell power bonus
    code: int32 spellPowerBonus = unit->GetMaxPositiveAuraModifierByMiscValue(SPELL_AURA_MODIFY_SPELL_POWER,
      100); // Returns maximum spell power bonus from all auras with misc value 100
    language: cpp
  - title: Finding attack power bonus
    code: int32 attackPowerBonus = unit->GetMaxPositiveAuraModifierByMiscValue(SPELL_AURA_MOD_ATTACK_POWER,
      50); // Returns maximum attack power bonus from all auras with misc value 50
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other aura-related functions
    to determine total bonuses or modifiers. Performance considerations are minimal
    as it only examines active auras, but it should be used carefully in high-frequency
    operations like combat calculations. Thread safety depends on the underlying implementation
    of the unit's aura system.
  warnings: The method only returns positive values; negative modifiers are ignored.
    This can lead to unexpected results if negative modifiers are expected. Also,
    this function may return 0 if no matching positive aura exists, which could be
    misinterpreted as a zero bonus rather than an absence of bonus.
