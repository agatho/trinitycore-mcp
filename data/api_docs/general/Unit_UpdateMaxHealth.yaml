  method: UpdateMaxHealth
  signature: void Unit::UpdateMaxHealth()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the maximum health value of the unit based on current modifiers and
    base stats.
  description: The UpdateMaxHealth method recalculates and sets the maximum health
    value for a Unit object. This function is typically invoked when health-related
    modifiers, such as level changes, buffs, debuffs, or stat modifications, are applied
    to the unit. It ensures that the unit's maximum health reflects all current game
    state factors including base health, temporary bonuses, permanent enhancements,
    and any other applicable modifiers. The method internally processes these factors
    and updates the internal max health value accordingly. This is a core part of
    the unit's health management system in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Unit* player = ...;

      player->UpdateMaxHealth();'
    language: cpp
  - title: After Stat Modification
    code: 'Unit* creature = ...;

      creature->SetModifierValue(UNIT_MOD_HEALTH, 100);

      creature->UpdateMaxHealth(); // Refresh max health after modifier change'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a unit's maximum health needs to be
    recalculated due to stat changes. It is often invoked automatically by the game
    engine during certain events like level ups or status effect updates, but manual
    invocation may be required in custom scripts or modifications.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper conditions can lead
    to performance degradation. It's recommended to only call it when actual stat
    changes have occurred rather than on every frame update.
