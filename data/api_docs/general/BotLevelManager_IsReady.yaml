documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot level manager is ready for operation
  description: The IsReady method determines whether the BotLevelManager instance
    has completed its initialization process and is prepared to handle bot level operations.
    This method typically verifies that all necessary data structures are populated,
    configuration settings are valid, and required resources are available. The check
    is usually performed before allowing any bot level adjustments or queries to prevent
    runtime errors. The method returns true when the manager is fully initialized
    and ready for use, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotLevelManager is fully initialized and ready to perform
    level-related operations; returns false if initialization is incomplete or if
    the manager is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botLevelManager.IsReady()) {\n    // Proceed with bot level operations\n\
      \    botLevelManager.SetBotLevel(player, 60);\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ not complete\n    sLog->outError(\"BotLevelManager is not ready\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight check on internal state flags rather than
    complex validation. It's recommended to call this before any bot level modification
    operations to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
