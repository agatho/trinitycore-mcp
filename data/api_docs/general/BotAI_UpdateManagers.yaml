documentation:
  brief: Updates all AI managers within the bot's AI system based on the elapsed time
    since last update.
  description: The UpdateManagers method is responsible for processing and updating
    all active AI managers within the BotAI system. It typically handles tasks such
    as managing behavior states, processing decisions, updating target selections,
    and maintaining internal AI state based on the time delta provided. This method
    is called regularly by the game loop to ensure that bot AI remains responsive
    and up-to-date with current conditions. The method uses the 'diff' parameter to
    determine how much time has passed since the last execution, which is crucial
    for time-based AI behaviors like cooldowns, movement timing, or reaction delays.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    // ... other game\
      \ logic ...\n    botAI->UpdateManagers(diff);\n    // ... continue with other\
      \ updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the main game update loop and
    should not be called directly unless you're implementing custom AI update logic.
    It's important to ensure that 'diff' accurately reflects the time passed since
    last call, as incorrect timing can lead to erratic AI behavior.
