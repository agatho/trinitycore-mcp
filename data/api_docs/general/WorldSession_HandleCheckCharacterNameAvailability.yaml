  method: HandleCheckCharacterNameAvailability
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleCheckCharacterNameAvailability(WorldPackets::Character::CheckCharacterNameAvailability
    & checkCharacterNameAvailability)
documentation:
  brief: Checks the availability of a character name and sends the result back to
    the client.
  description: The HandleCheckCharacterNameAvailability method processes a client
    request to verify whether a specified character name is available for use. It
    validates the name against various game rules such as length, forbidden characters,
    and existing character names. The method performs this check asynchronously and
    responds to the client with a packet indicating whether the name is available
    or not. This functionality is typically used during character creation when players
    enter their desired name.
  parameters:
  - name: checkCharacterNameAvailability
    description: A packet containing the character name to be checked for availability.
      The packet structure includes the name string that the client wishes to validate.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in character creation flow
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleCheckCharacterNameAvailability(WorldPackets::Character::CheckCharacterNameAvailability&\
      \ checkCharacterNameAvailability)\n{\n    std::string name = checkCharacterNameAvailability.Name;\n\
      \    bool isAvailable = sObjectMgr->IsCharacterNameAvailable(name);\n    WorldPackets::Character::CheckCharacterNameAvailabilityResponse\
      \ response;\n    response.Name = name;\n    response.Available = isAvailable;\n\
      \    SendPacket(response.Write());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the character management system and should be called
    only during character creation or renaming processes. The implementation relies
    on database lookups, so performance may vary depending on the number of existing
    characters in the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the name validation logic aligns with game rules to prevent
    invalid names from being used. Be cautious about potential race conditions if
    multiple clients attempt to create a character with the same name simultaneously.
