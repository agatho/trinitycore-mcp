documentation:
  brief: Disallows or allows combat status for the unit.
  description: This method controls whether a unit can enter combat state, effectively
    preventing or enabling combat behavior. It is commonly used to manage NPC or player
    combat status during specific gameplay events such as teleportation, summoning,
    or during scripted sequences. The method directly affects the unit's ability to
    engage in combat with other units, and when applied, it prevents the unit from
    entering combat even if it would normally do so. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining game balance and preventing unintended combat scenarios during
    controlled gameplay events.
  parameters:
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to disallow (true) or allow (false)
      combat status for the unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();


      // Disallow combat for the unit

      target->SetIsCombatDisallowed(true);


      // Allow combat for the unit

      target->SetIsCombatDisallowed(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    to control unit behavior during gameplay events. It should be used carefully as
    it can affect the overall game balance and player experience.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to unexpected combat behavior or
    prevent units from engaging in combat when they should, potentially causing game
    imbalance or player frustration.
