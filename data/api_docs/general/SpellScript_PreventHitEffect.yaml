  signature: void SpellScript::PreventHitEffect(int effIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Prevents the hit effect of a spell from being applied to targets.
  description: The PreventHitEffect method is used within SpellScript implementations
    to stop a specific effect of a spell from triggering its hit effect. This method
    takes an effect index parameter and prevents the corresponding spell effect from
    applying its hit logic, such as damage or healing, to affected targets. It's commonly
    used in custom spell implementations where certain effects should be suppressed
    while others are allowed to proceed. The method must be called during the appropriate
    spell script phase, typically within the OnHit or similar event handlers.
  parameters:
  - name: effIndex
    description: The index of the spell effect for which to prevent the hit effect.
      This corresponds to the effect index in the spell's effect array (0-based).
      Valid values are integers representing valid effect indices in the spell's configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Preventing a specific spell effect from applying its hit
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnHit()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Prevent the first effect (index 0) from applying\
      \ its hit effect\n        PreventHitEffect(0);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional prevention of spell effects based on target state
    code: "class AdvancedSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnHit()\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (GetHitTarget()->HasAura(12345)) // Check for\
      \ a specific aura\n        {\n            PreventHitEffect(1); // Prevent second\
      \ effect from triggering\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects the hit effect behavior and does not prevent the
    spell's initial cast or other phases. It should be used carefully to avoid breaking
    expected spell mechanics. The effect index must correspond to a valid effect in
    the spell definition, otherwise the call may have no effect or cause undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling PreventHitEffect with an invalid effect index can lead to unexpected
    behavior or crashes. Always ensure that the effIndex parameter refers to a valid
    effect within the spell's configuration. Using this method inappropriately might
    break spell interactions or create exploits in gameplay mechanics.
