documentation:
  brief: Resets all bot statistics and session data within the optimized world session
    manager.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears all accumulated bot-related statistics
    and resets the internal state of the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized class. This includes
    clearing counters, timers, and any cached data related to bot behavior and session
    management. The method is typically invoked when resetting bot configurations
    or during server maintenance to ensure clean state for subsequent operations.
    It does not affect active bot sessions or player connections, but rather resets
    the tracking and statistical information maintained by the manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset all bot statistics
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized* sessionMgr = BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::instance();

      sessionMgr->ResetStatistics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully during server maintenance or when
    reconfiguring bot systems to avoid losing important tracking data. It is not thread-safe
    and should be executed in a controlled environment where no bot operations are
    actively occurring.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are actively running may result in inconsistent
    state tracking. Ensure all bot sessions are properly terminated before invoking
    this method.
