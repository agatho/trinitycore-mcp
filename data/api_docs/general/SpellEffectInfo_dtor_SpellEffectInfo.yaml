documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SpellEffectInfo object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SpellEffectInfo class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources associated with the spell effect
    information. In the context of TrinityCore's spell system, this method ensures
    proper deallocation of data structures that hold details about individual spell
    effects, such as effect type, value, target, and other parameters. This destructor
    is automatically invoked when a SpellEffectInfo object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted, ensuring no memory leaks occur in the spell handling subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SpellEffectInfo object
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    SpellEffectInfo effectInfo;\n    // ...\
      \ use effectInfo ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when effectInfo\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically not called directly by user code. It's invoked
    automatically by the C++ runtime when objects go out of scope or are deleted.
    The SpellEffectInfo class likely contains pointers to other data structures, so
    proper cleanup in the destructor is essential for preventing memory leaks.
