  class: BotSpawnerFactory
  method: IsOrchestratorAvailable
  signature: bool BotSpawnerFactory::IsOrchestratorAvailable()
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot orchestrator is available for use.
  description: The IsOrchestratorAvailable method determines if the bot orchestrator
    system is currently active and ready to spawn or manage bots. This check typically
    verifies that the necessary components, such as the orchestrator thread or manager
    instance, are initialized and operational. The method is commonly used before
    attempting to perform bot-related operations to prevent errors due to an uninitialized
    or disabled orchestrator. It may also consider factors like server load or configuration
    settings that could affect orchestrator availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot orchestrator is available and ready for use, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check orchestrator status
    code: "if (BotSpawnerFactory::Instance()->IsOrchestratorAvailable()) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with bot spawning logic\n    BotSpawnerFactory::Instance()->SpawnBot(playerGuid);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where orchestrator is not available\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Bot orchestrator is not available\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lightweight check without locking or heavy
    computation, making it safe to call frequently. It's recommended to cache the
    result if checking multiple times in quick succession.
