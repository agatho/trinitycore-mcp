  brief: Executes emergency defensive abilities for Vengeance Demon Hunters during
    combat situations
  description: The HandleEmergencyDefensives method implements the core logic for
    activating emergency defensive cooldowns and abilities specific to the Vengeance
    Demon Hunter specialization. This method is typically invoked when the player's
    health drops below a critical threshold or when certain combat conditions are
    met. It evaluates the current state of the Demon Hunter's resources, including
    fury generation, available defensive abilities, and combat context to determine
    which emergency defensive action should be executed. The method ensures that defensive
    cooldowns are properly managed and that the most appropriate defensive ability
    is selected based on the current threat level and player positioning.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_player->GetHealth()\
      \ < m_player->GetMaxHealth() * 0.3f)\n    {\n        m_demonHunter->HandleEmergencyDefensives();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat situations where emergency
    defensive actions are warranted. The implementation assumes that the Demon Hunter
    has sufficient resources to execute defensive abilities and that appropriate combat
    state checks have been performed prior to invocation.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context as it may result in
    improper ability usage or resource depletion. Ensure proper cooldown management
    is handled by the calling code to prevent spamming defensive abilities.
