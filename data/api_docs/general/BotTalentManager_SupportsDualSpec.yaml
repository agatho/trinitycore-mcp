documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot supports dual specialization at the given level
  description: This method checks if the bot's current class and level support the
    dual specialization feature in World of Warcraft. Dual specialization allows players
    to have two different talent builds, switching between them using a special interface.
    The method evaluates the bot's class restrictions and level requirements for dual
    spec availability. It returns true if the bot can utilize dual specialization
    based on its class and current level, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the bot supports dual specialization at the specified level, false
    otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Check if bot supports dual spec at level 60
    code: "BotTalentManager talentManager;\nbool canDualSpec = talentManager.SupportsDualSpec(60);\n\
      if (canDualSpec)\n{\n    // Bot can use dual specialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks against the game's built-in restrictions for dual
    specialization, which typically requires players to be at least level 10 and have
    a class that supports dual specs. The implementation may cache results or query
    internal bot configuration data.
