  signature: uint32 GameObjectTemplate::GetLinkedGameObjectEntry() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the entry ID of the linked GameObject for this template.
  description: The GetLinkedGameObjectEntry method retrieves the entry identifier
    of another GameObject that is linked to this GameObjectTemplate. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, certain game objects can be linked together, such as doors and their
    associated triggers or quest-related objects. This method allows access to the
    linked object's template entry, which can be used to identify or interact with
    the related GameObject in the game world. The returned value corresponds to the
    entry field in the gameobject_template table for the linked object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the entry ID of the linked GameObject template.
    If no link exists, this will typically return 0.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Linked GameObject Entry
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(176545);\n\
      uint32 linkedEntry = goTemplate->GetLinkedGameObjectEntry();\nif (linkedEntry\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Process the linked GameObject\n    GameObjectTemplate* linkedTemplate\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(linkedEntry);\n    // Use linkedTemplate...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject-related
    systems such as quest triggers, door mechanisms, or interactive object linking.
    It's important to verify that the returned entry ID corresponds to an existing
    GameObject template before attempting to use it.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without checking if the returned value
    is zero, as this may indicate no linked object exists. Accessing a non-existent
    GameObject template with the returned entry could lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes.
