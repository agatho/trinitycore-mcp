  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ShouldSkipLowPriorityInterrupt
  signature: bool SpellInterruptAction::ShouldSkipLowPriorityInterrupt(BotAI * ai,
    const InterruptContext & context) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a low-priority spell interrupt should be skipped based
    on AI context and interrupt conditions.
  description: The ShouldSkipLowPriorityInterrupt method evaluates if a bot's AI should
    avoid interrupting a low-priority spell. This decision is made by analyzing the
    provided interrupt context and the current state of the AI. It typically checks
    factors such as the priority level of the incoming spell, available mana, threat
    levels, or other tactical considerations. The method is used within the SpellInterruptAction
    class to determine appropriate interrupt behavior for bots in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that provides context for decision-making.
      This includes information about the bot's current state, target, and available
      resources.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to an InterruptContext object containing details about
      the spell interrupt being considered, such as spell ID, priority level, and
      timing conditions.
  returns: Returns true if the low-priority spell interrupt should be skipped; otherwise
    returns false. A return value of true indicates that the AI will not interrupt
    the spell at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Logic
    code: "if (!spellInterruptAction.ShouldSkipLowPriorityInterrupt(ai, context))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with interrupting the spell\n    ai->InterruptCurrentSpell();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interrupt Handling Based on Priority
    code: "bool skipInterrupt = spellInterruptAction.ShouldSkipLowPriorityInterrupt(ai,\
      \ context);\nif (!skipInterrupt && context.GetSpellPriority() < 2) {\n    //\
      \ Only interrupt low-priority spells if not skipped\n    ai->CastSpell(context.GetInterruptSpellId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell interrupt logic in TrinityCore's bot
    AI system. It helps optimize bot behavior by preventing unnecessary spell interruptions
    that could disrupt more important actions or waste mana.
  warnings: Ensure that the InterruptContext and BotAI parameters are valid before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. Incorrect handling of these objects
    may lead to failed interrupt attempts or unexpected AI decisions.
