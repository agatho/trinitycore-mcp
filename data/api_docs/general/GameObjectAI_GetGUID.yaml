  class: GameObjectAI
  method: GetGUID
  signature: int GameObjectAI::GetGUID(int32 id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the GameObjectAI instance.
  description: The GetGUID method returns the globally unique identifier associated
    with the GameObjectAI instance. This GUID is used internally by TrinityCore to
    uniquely identify game objects within the world. The method is typically called
    by AI systems or other subsystems that need to reference a specific game object.
    It's important to note that this method may return different values depending
    on the context and state of the GameObject, particularly if the object has been
    respawned or moved. The returned GUID can be used for various purposes including
    tracking, referencing, or performing operations on the specific game object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the GameObjectAI
    instance. This value is typically a positive integer that uniquely identifies
    the game object within the TrinityCore world state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic GUID Retrieval
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    void OnSpawn()\
      \ override {\n        int guid = GetGUID();\n        // Use the GUID for logging\
      \ or tracking\n        sLog->outString(\"GameObject spawned with GUID: %d\"\
      , guid);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GUID returned by this method is managed by the TrinityCore framework
    and should not be modified directly. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with other GameObject-related APIs to maintain consistency in object references
    throughout the game world.
