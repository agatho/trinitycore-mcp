  method: GetGlobalTurnInMetrics
  signature: TurnInMetrics::Snapshot QuestTurnIn::GetGlobalTurnInMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a snapshot of global quest turn-in metrics for tracking and analysis.
  description: The GetGlobalTurnInMetrics method returns a snapshot of aggregate quest
    turn-in statistics across the entire server. This includes data such as total
    completed quests, average completion time, and success rates. The returned TurnInMetrics::Snapshot
    object provides a point-in-time view of how players are interacting with quests
    system-wide. This method is typically used for server monitoring, performance
    analysis, and game balance tuning by administrators or developers. The snapshot
    contains read-only data that reflects the cumulative metrics since the server
    started or last reset.
  parameters: []
  returns: A TurnInMetrics::Snapshot object containing global quest turn-in statistics
    including completion counts, timing data, and success rates. The snapshot represents
    a consistent view of metrics at the time of the call and does not update automatically.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Global Metrics
    code: 'TurnInMetrics::Snapshot globalMetrics = questTurnIn->GetGlobalTurnInMetrics();

      uint32 totalCompleted = globalMetrics.GetTotalCompletedQuests();

      float averageTime = globalMetrics.GetAverageCompletionTime();

      printf("Total Quests Completed: %u, Avg Time: %.2f seconds\n", totalCompleted,
      averageTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a consistent snapshot of metrics and does not reflect
    real-time changes. The data is aggregated across all players and quests in the
    server. For performance reasons, frequent calls to this method should be avoided
    in high-frequency code paths.
  warnings: The returned TurnInMetrics::Snapshot object should not be modified as
    it represents read-only global state. Modifications to the snapshot will not affect
    actual metrics. Be cautious when using this in multi-threaded environments where
    concurrent modifications might occur.
