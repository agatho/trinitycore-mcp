  class: GroupModel
  method: GetLiquid
  signature: const WmoLiquid * GroupModel::GetLiquid() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the liquid data associated with the group model.
  description: The GetLiquid method retrieves a pointer to the WmoLiquid object that
    represents the liquid data for this GroupModel. This is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's terrain rendering system to determine water or other liquid properties
    within a specific group of WMO (World Map Object) components. The returned pointer
    may be null if no liquid data exists for this particular group model. This method
    is commonly called during map loading and rendering processes to properly display
    liquid surfaces such as lakes, rivers, or oceans.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the WmoLiquid object associated with this GroupModel,
    or nullptr if no liquid data is present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for liquid data
    code: "const WmoLiquid* liquid = groupModel->GetLiquid();\nif (liquid != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process liquid data\n    uint32 liquidType = liquid->GetType();\n\
      \    // ... handle liquid properties\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using liquid data for terrain rendering
    code: "GroupModel* model = GetGroupModel();\nconst WmoLiquid* liquid = model->GetLiquid();\n\
      if (liquid != nullptr)\n{\n    // Render liquid surface with appropriate material\n\
      \    RenderLiquidSurface(liquid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Render default terrain\n\
      \    RenderDefaultTerrain();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned WmoLiquid pointer is valid only during the lifetime of the GroupModel
    object. This method does not perform any memory management or allocation; it simply
    returns a cached reference to existing liquid data. The method is typically called
    from within rendering or map loading contexts where WMO group data is processed.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned WmoLiquid pointer as it points to internal
    data structures. Accessing the returned pointer after the GroupModel has been
    destroyed results in undefined behavior. Always check for null before using the
    returned value.
