  method: IsActive
  signature: bool IManagerBase::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the manager instance is currently active and operational.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the IManagerBase instance is in an
    active state, meaning it has been properly initialized and is ready to perform
    its intended functions. This method typically checks internal flags or state variables
    that indicate whether the manager is currently running or enabled within the TrinityCore
    framework. The result of this check can be used by other systems to ensure that
    operations are only performed on valid, active managers. This is particularly
    important in systems where managers may be dynamically enabled or disabled during
    runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the manager instance is currently active and operational;
    otherwise returns false if it is inactive, uninitialized, or has been shut down.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (manager->IsActive()) {\n    // Perform operations only if manager is\
      \ active\n    manager->DoWork();\n} else {\n    // Handle inactive state\n \
      \   LogError(\"Manager is not active\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameUpdate() {\n    if (aiManager && aiManager->IsActive()) {\n  \
      \      aiManager->Update();\n    }\n    if (eventManager && eventManager->IsActive())\
      \ {\n        eventManager->ProcessEvents();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a fast, constant-time check that
    relies on internal boolean flags. It's designed to be called frequently during
    game updates or event processing without performance impact. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if the manager can be accessed from multiple threads.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method for critical operations, as the
    active state may change between the time you check IsActive() and when you perform
    an operation. Consider using locks or atomic operations if thread safety is required.
