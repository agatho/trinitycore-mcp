documentation:
  brief: Removes expired pathfinding cache entries from the adapter's internal cache
    storage.
  description: The CleanExpiredCache method is responsible for removing outdated or
    stale pathfinding cache entries that have exceeded their designated lifetime.
    This method ensures that the pathfinding system maintains optimal performance
    by preventing the accumulation of unnecessary data in memory. It typically iterates
    through the cached paths and removes those that are no longer valid due to time
    expiration or changes in the environment. The method is commonly invoked periodically
    by the game engine or upon specific events such as map updates or server maintenance.

  notes: This method is usually called automatically by the TrinityCore pathfinding
    system at regular intervals. Developers should not need to call this manually
    unless implementing custom cache management logic. The method is thread-safe and
    can be safely invoked from any thread context.
