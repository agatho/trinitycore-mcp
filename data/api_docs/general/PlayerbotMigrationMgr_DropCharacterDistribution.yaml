  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: DropCharacterDistribution
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::DropCharacterDistribution()
documentation:
  brief: Drops the character distribution data for playerbots in the migration manager.
  description: The DropCharacterDistribution method removes or clears the existing
    character distribution data that is managed by the PlayerbotMigrationMgr. This
    operation typically occurs during the cleanup phase of a playerbot migration process,
    ensuring that stale or outdated character assignment data is removed from memory.
    The method is designed to prepare the migration manager for a fresh distribution
    cycle or to reset its internal state when necessary. It does not take any parameters
    and returns a boolean value indicating success or failure of the operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the character distribution data was successfully dropped,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that no data existed to
    drop or an error occurred during the cleanup process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->DropCharacterDistribution()) {\n\
      \    // Character distribution data successfully dropped\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Character distribution data dropped successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to drop character distribution data\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to drop character\
      \ distribution data.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during system shutdown or reset operations
    within the playerbot migration framework. It's important to ensure that no active
    migrations are in progress before calling this method, as it may lead to inconsistent
    state if data is being actively used.
  warnings: Calling this method while other threads or processes are using the character
    distribution data may result in undefined behavior or data corruption. Always
    verify that all references to the distribution data have been cleared before invoking
    this function.
