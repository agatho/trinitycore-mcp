  brief: Initializes the role definitions for Paladin classes within the game system
  description: The InitializePaladinRoles method sets up and configures all necessary
    role definitions and associated parameters for Paladin characters in the TrinityCore
    framework. This includes defining the primary roles such as Holy, Protection,
    and Retribution, along with their respective abilities, cooldowns, and gameplay
    mechanics. The method ensures that Paladin-specific role configurations are properly
    registered and available for use during character creation, class switching, or
    role assignment processes within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: RoleDefinitions::InitializePaladinRoles();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during server initialization or when
    loading class-specific configurations. It is designed to be thread-safe and does
    not require any external dependencies to be pre-loaded.
  warnings: Ensure this method is only called once during application startup to prevent
    duplicate role definitions. Reinitialization may cause unexpected behavior in
    role-based systems.
