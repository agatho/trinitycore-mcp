  class: BotAI
  method: UnsubscribeFromEventBuses
  signature: void BotAI::UnsubscribeFromEventBuses()
documentation:
  brief: Unsubscribes the bot AI from all registered event buses to stop receiving
    event notifications.
  description: The UnsubscribeFromEventBuses method removes the BotAI instance from
    all event bus subscriptions, effectively halting the delivery of events to this
    AI component. This is typically called when the bot is being destroyed or deactivated
    to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup of event handlers. The method
    ensures that no further event callbacks will be invoked for this AI instance after
    execution. It's an essential part of the AI lifecycle management within the TrinityCore
    framework, particularly in scenarios involving dynamic bot creation and destruction.

  - title: Basic Usage During Bot Cleanup
    code: "void CleanupBot(BotAI* bot)\n{\n    if (bot)\n    {\n        bot->UnsubscribeFromEventBuses();\n\
      \        // Additional cleanup code...\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying a BotAI instance to prevent
    dangling event callbacks. It's recommended to call this method as part of the
    AI's destructor or cleanup routine to maintain system stability.
