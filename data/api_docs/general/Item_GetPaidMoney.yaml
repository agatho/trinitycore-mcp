  signature: uint64 Item::GetPaidMoney() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the amount of money paid for the item.
  description: This method retrieves the monetary value associated with an item, typically
    representing the price paid by a player for purchasing the item from a vendor
    or the value of the item when it was created. The returned value is expressed
    in copper coins and reflects the actual payment made for the item, which may differ
    from its base value or sell price. This method is commonly used in item-related
    game mechanics such as vendor transactions, auction house operations, or when
    determining item value during crafting.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the amount of money paid for the item
    in copper coins. This value corresponds to the payment made by the player when
    purchasing the item from a vendor or the value assigned to the item upon creation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 paidMoney = item->GetPaidMoney();

      std::cout << "Item was paid: " << paidMoney << " copper coins" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparison with Item Value
    code: "uint64 paidMoney = item->GetPaidMoney();\nuint64 itemValue = item->GetTemplate()->SellPrice;\n\
      if (paidMoney > itemValue) {\n    std::cout << \"Item was purchased above its\
      \ sell price\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with item purchase transactions.
    It may be affected by various game mechanics such as vendor markup or discount,
    and should not be confused with the item's base value or sell price. The returned
    value represents the actual payment made rather than the item's potential value.
  warnings: This method does not account for any potential discounts or special pricing
    applied during vendor transactions. It returns only the original payment amount
    without considering any modifications that may have occurred due to player-specific
    factors such as reputation or group discounts.
