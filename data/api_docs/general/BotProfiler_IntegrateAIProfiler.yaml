documentation:
  brief: Integrates AI profiling capabilities into the bot system for performance
    monitoring and analysis.
  description: The IntegrateAIProfiler method sets up and initializes the AI profiling
    infrastructure within the BotProfiler class. This function likely configures profiling
    hooks, registers necessary callbacks, or establishes data collection mechanisms
    to monitor the behavior and performance of AI-controlled bots in World of Warcraft.
    It serves as a foundational step that enables subsequent profiling operations
    and ensures that AI-related metrics can be accurately tracked and analyzed. The
    method is typically called during system initialization or when profiling capabilities
    are dynamically enabled.

  - title: Basic Integration Usage
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.IntegrateAIProfiler(); // Initializes AI profiling for bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any profiling operations are performed.
    It may involve setting up internal data structures or registering with the game's
    performance monitoring subsystems.
