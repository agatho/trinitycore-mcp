  signature: uint64 BotLevelManager::CreateBotAsync(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot asynchronously and returns its unique identifier.
  description: The CreateBotAsync method is responsible for initiating the creation
    of a new bot character within the TrinityCore framework. It performs asynchronous
    operations to set up the bot's data, including initializing player attributes,
    assigning a unique GUID, and preparing the bot for gameplay. This method does
    not block the calling thread and allows for concurrent bot creation processes.
    The returned uint64 value represents the globally unique identifier assigned to
    the newly created bot, which can be used to reference or manipulate the bot instance
    in subsequent operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the unique global identifier (GUID)
    of the newly created bot. This GUID is used throughout the TrinityCore system
    to uniquely identify and reference the bot instance in various game systems, database
    entries, and network communications.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Creation
    code: uint64 botGuid = botLevelManager->CreateBotAsync(player);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be non-blocking and should be used in scenarios
    where concurrent bot creation is required. The actual bot initialization process
    may take some time to complete asynchronously, but the method returns immediately
    with a GUID for the new bot.
  warnings: Ensure that proper player context is provided to the method as it requires
    a valid Player pointer. Improper handling of the returned GUID could lead to referencing
    invalid bot instances if not properly validated.
