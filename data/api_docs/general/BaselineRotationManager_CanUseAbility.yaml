  class: BaselineRotationManager
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool BaselineRotationManager::CanUseAbility(int * bot, int * target,
    const BaselineAbility & ability) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot can use a specified ability based on current game
    state and conditions.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a given bot is eligible to use
    a specific ability at the current moment. It checks various preconditions such
    as mana requirements, cooldowns, target validity, and other combat-related constraints
    defined by the BaselineAbility structure. This method is crucial for AI decision-making
    in baseline rotation systems, ensuring that only valid abilities are considered
    for execution during combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot's data structure containing current state information
      such as health, mana, and available abilities.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target's data structure used to validate targeting
      conditions and combat eligibility for the ability.
  - name: ability
    description: Reference to a BaselineAbility object that defines the ability properties
      including cooldown, cost, range, and usage requirements.
  returns: Returns true if all conditions are met and the bot can use the ability;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (rotationManager.CanUseAbility(&bot, &target, ability)) {\n    // Execute\
      \ the ability\n    bot.ExecuteAbility(ability);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Rotation Logic
    code: "bool CanCast = rotationManager.CanUseAbility(&playerBot, &currentTarget,\
      \ spell);\nif (CanCast && !playerBot.IsCasting()) {\n    playerBot.CastSpell(spell);\n\
      \    return true;\n}\nreturn false;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs checks on cooldowns, resource costs, target validity,
    and other game mechanics. It is typically called before attempting to execute
    an ability to prevent invalid actions that could lead to errors or unintended
    behavior in the AI system.
  warnings: Ensure that bot and target pointers are valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The BaselineAbility object must be properly initialized
    with all required fields for accurate evaluation.
