  class: InteractionManager
  method: SetHearthstone
  signature: bool InteractionManager::SetHearthstone(Player * bot, Creature * innkeeper)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's hearthstone location to the innkeeper's location.
  description: The SetHearthstone method configures a player's hearthstone to teleport
    back to the current location of the specified innkeeper creature. This functionality
    is typically used in AI scripts or quest systems where bots need to set their
    home location for quick travel. The method verifies that the player is within
    interaction range of the innkeeper and that the innkeeper is a valid hearthstone
    provider. It returns true upon successful configuration, or false if the operation
    fails due to invalid parameters, insufficient distance, or other game restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose hearthstone location will be set.
  - name: innkeeper
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the innkeeper that serves
      as the hearthstone destination.
  returns: True if the hearthstone was successfully set to the innkeeper's location;
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (interactionManager.SetHearthstone(player, innkeeper)) {\n    player->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Hearthstone set to innkeeper's location.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Error Handling
    code: "if (!interactionManager.SetHearthstone(bot, innkeeper)) {\n    if (bot->IsInMap(innkeeper))\
      \ {\n        bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Failed to set hearthstone.\
      \ Please try again.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying TrinityCore mechanics for validating
    player-innkeeper interactions, including range checks and creature type verification.
    The method does not directly modify the database but updates in-memory state related
    to the player's hearthstone location.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot is within valid interaction distance of the innkeeper
    before calling this method. Calling with invalid pointers or non-innkeeper creatures
    will result in failure without throwing exceptions.
