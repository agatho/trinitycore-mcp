  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadSpawnGroupTemplates()
documentation:
  brief: Loads spawn group templates from the database into memory for use during
    world object spawning.
  description: The LoadSpawnGroupTemplates method initializes and loads all spawn
    group template definitions from the database into internal memory structures.
    These templates define how groups of creatures or game objects should be spawned
    together in specific scenarios, such as boss encounters or scripted events. The
    method is typically called during server startup or when reloading spawn data.
    It processes data from the `spawn_group_template` table and prepares it for use
    by the spawn group system. This method does not return any value but modifies
    internal state to support dynamic spawning behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadSpawnGroupTemplates();\n    // Continue with\
      \ other systems...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup or database reload operations.
    It's important to note that spawn group templates are not dynamically updated
    at runtime; changes require a reload of the data. The method assumes that the
    database connection is already established and valid.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    duplicate entries in internal structures. Ensure that it's only called once during
    initialization or after clearing existing spawn group data.
