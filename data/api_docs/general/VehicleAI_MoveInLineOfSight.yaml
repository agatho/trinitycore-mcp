  class: VehicleAI
  method: MoveInLineOfSight
  signature: void VehicleAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles AI behavior when a vehicle detects an entity in its line of sight.
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight method is a core component of the VehicleAI class
    that manages how a vehicle responds when it detects another unit within its visual
    range. This method is typically invoked by the game engine's AI system when an
    NPC or player enters the vehicle's detection area. It triggers appropriate actions
    such as engaging targets, initiating combat behaviors, or updating the vehicle's
    state based on detected entities. The method integrates with the broader TrinityCore
    AI framework to ensure vehicles behave realistically in combat and non-combat
    scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that may represent a unit identifier
      or detection flag. This parameter is typically used internally by the AI system
      to determine which entity has entered the vehicle's line of sight.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle AI Line of Sight Detection
    code: "class MyVehicleAI : public VehicleAI {\npublic:\n    void MoveInLineOfSight(int*\
      \ unitId) override {\n        // Custom logic when a unit enters line of sight\n\
      \        if (unitId && *unitId != 0) {\n            // Process the detected\
      \ unit\n            HandleUnitDetected(*unitId);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Vehicle AI with Combat Response
    code: "class CombatVehicleAI : public VehicleAI {\npublic:\n    void MoveInLineOfSight(int*\
      \ unitId) override {\n        if (!unitId || *unitId == 0) return;\n       \
      \ \n        Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*unitId);\n        if (target\
      \ && target->IsHostileTo(GetOwner())) {\n            // Initiate combat behavior\n\
      \            AttackStart(target);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called frequently during AI updates, so performance considerations
    are important. The parameter may be null or zero in certain edge cases. Implementations
    should check for valid input before processing to avoid crashes. This method is
    part of the standard AI update cycle and should not block execution.
  warnings: Do not modify the input parameter directly as it may cause unexpected
    behavior in the core AI system. Ensure proper null checks are performed on the
    unit identifier to prevent access violations. Avoid heavy computations or blocking
    operations within this method to maintain game performance.
