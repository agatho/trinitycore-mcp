  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: UpdateGroupStatistics
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::UpdateGroupStatistics(uint32 groupId, const
    GroupStatistics & stats)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the statistics for a specified group within the playerbot system.
  description: The UpdateGroupStatistics method is responsible for updating and storing
    statistical data related to a specific group managed by the playerbot system.
    This method likely handles metrics such as member counts, activity levels, or
    performance indicators for groups of bots. It ensures that group statistics are
    accurately maintained and synchronized within the TrinityCore framework's bot
    management infrastructure. The method operates on a given group ID and applies
    the provided statistics object to update internal tracking structures.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier for the group whose statistics are being updated.
      This value must correspond to an existing group within the playerbot system.
  - name: stats
    description: Reference to a GroupStatistics object containing the updated statistical
      data for the specified group. This structure typically holds metrics like member
      counts, activity levels, or performance indicators.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update group statistics with new data
    code: 'GroupStatistics newStats;

      newStats.memberCount = 5;

      newStats.averageLevel = 60;

      playerbotGroupManager->UpdateGroupStatistics(12345, newStats);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the internal playerbot AI system and may be
    called during group management operations or periodic updates. The implementation
    should ensure thread safety when updating shared group data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupId parameter references a valid existing group to
    avoid undefined behavior. Improper use of this method could lead to inconsistent
    group state tracking within the bot system.
