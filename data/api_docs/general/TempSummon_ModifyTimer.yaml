  class: TempSummon
  method: ModifyTimer
  signature: void TempSummon::ModifyTimer(int mod)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the timer of a temporary summon by the specified amount.
  description: The ModifyTimer method adjusts the internal timer of a TempSummon object,
    which controls how long the summon will remain active before being automatically
    removed. This method is commonly used to extend or shorten the duration of temporary
    summons such as pets, guardians, or other summoned creatures. The modification
    is applied directly to the summon's remaining time, allowing for dynamic control
    over summon lifespans during combat or quest events. The timer is typically measured
    in milliseconds and can be adjusted positively (to extend) or negatively (to shorten)
    the summon's lifetime.
  parameters:
  - name: mod
    description: The amount by which to modify the summon's timer, in milliseconds.
      Positive values extend the timer, negative values reduce it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Extend Summon Duration
    code: "TempSummon* summon = player->GetFirstControlled();\nif (summon)\n{\n  \
      \  summon->ModifyTimer(5000); // Extend timer by 5 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Shorten Summon Duration
    code: "TempSummon* summon = player->GetFirstControlled();\nif (summon)\n{\n  \
      \  summon->ModifyTimer(-3000); // Reduce timer by 3 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal timer of the summon without any
    validation checks. It is important to ensure that the modification does not result
    in a negative timer value that could cause unexpected behavior or early removal
    of the summon. The method operates on the summon's current remaining time and
    should be used carefully during active combat situations.
  warnings: Modifying the timer with large negative values may cause the summon to
    expire immediately, potentially leading to game state inconsistencies. Always
    verify that the modification is within reasonable bounds to prevent unintended
    summon removal or gameplay disruption.
