  class: HealerPositioning
  method: EvaluateHealerPositions
  signature: int HealerPositioning::EvaluateHealerPositions(const int & candidates,
    const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the optimal healer positioning based on combat context
    and candidate positions.
  description: The EvaluateHealerPositions method determines the best possible positioning
    for a healer unit within a combat scenario. It analyzes the provided candidate
    positions and the current combat context to calculate an optimal placement that
    maximizes healing efficiency and survivability. The method considers factors such
    as target proximity, threat levels, and available line of sight. This function
    is typically used in AI-driven healer behavior systems to make dynamic positioning
    decisions during encounters. The method requires a valid combat context to be
    provided and assumes the candidates parameter contains a list or set of potential
    positions that are viable for healer placement.
  parameters:
  - name: candidates
    description: An integer representing the number or identifier of candidate positions
      available for healer placement. This value typically corresponds to a bitmask,
      array index, or enumeration of possible positioning options within the combat
      environment.
  - name: context
    description: A CombatPositionContext object containing detailed information about
      the current combat situation, including target positions, threat levels, player
      health states, and environmental factors that influence optimal healer positioning.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the index or identifier of the evaluated
    best healer position. A negative return value may indicate an error or invalid
    input, while a positive value corresponds to a valid candidate position within
    the provided candidates set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in healer AI
    code: "int bestPosition = healerPositioning.EvaluateHealerPositions(4, combatContext);\n\
      if (bestPosition >= 0) {\n    // Use bestPosition to move healer\n    MoveToPosition(bestPosition);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error case\n    LogError(\"Failed to evaluate healer\
      \ position\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with dynamic positioning
    code: "CombatPositionContext context;\ncontext.targetPosition = GetTargetPosition();\n\
      context.playerHealth = GetPlayerHealth();\ncontext.threatLevel = GetThreatLevel();\n\
      \nint candidates = GenerateCandidatePositions();\nint optimalPosition = healerPositioning.EvaluateHealerPositions(candidates,\
      \ context);\n\nif (optimalPosition > 0) {\n    // Update healer position\n \
      \   healer.SetPosition(optimalPosition);\n    healer.PerformHealingAction();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during combat scenarios,
    so performance optimization is important. The context object should be updated
    regularly to reflect the most current combat state for accurate positioning decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the candidates parameter is properly validated before calling
    this method, as invalid values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect positioning
    decisions. The CombatPositionContext must contain valid data; otherwise, the evaluation
    results will be unreliable.
