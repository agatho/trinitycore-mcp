  class: PlayerDataElementAccountEntry
  method: GetType
  signature: PlayerDataElementType PlayerDataElementAccountEntry::GetType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the data element type associated with this account entry.
  description: The GetType method returns the PlayerDataElementType enumeration value
    that identifies the specific type of data element represented by this PlayerDataElementAccountEntry
    instance. This is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to categorize and
    manage different types of player data elements within the account context. The
    returned value determines how the data element should be processed, stored, or
    retrieved in the game's data systems. This method is typically called during data
    synchronization, serialization, or when determining the appropriate handling logic
    for a given account data entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A PlayerDataElementType enumeration value indicating the type of this
    account data element. Possible values include but are not limited to: PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_CHARACTER,
    PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_GUILD, PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_ACCOUNT_DATA, etc., depending
    on the specific implementation and game data structure.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PlayerDataElementAccountEntry entry;\nPlayerDataElementType type = entry.GetType();\n\
      if (type == PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_CHARACTER)\n{\n    // Handle character-specific\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Type Checking in Data Processing
    code: "void ProcessAccountEntry(PlayerDataElementAccountEntry& entry)\n{\n   \
      \ switch (entry.GetType())\n    {\n        case PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_CHARACTER:\n\
      \            // Process character data\n            break;\n        case PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_TYPE_GUILD:\n\
      \            // Process guild data\n            break;\n        default:\n \
      \           // Handle unknown types\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not modify any internal state of
    the object. It should be safe to call from multiple threads if the underlying
    data structure is properly synchronized. The returned enumeration value is typically
    set during object construction or initialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the PlayerDataElementType enumeration values are consistent
    across all related systems, as mismatched types could lead to incorrect data handling
    or processing errors. Avoid making assumptions about the specific numeric values
    of the enumeration unless explicitly documented.
