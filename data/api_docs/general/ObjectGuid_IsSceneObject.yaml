  method: IsSceneObject
  signature: bool ObjectGuid::IsSceneObject() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a scene object within the World
    of Warcraft environment.
  description: The IsSceneObject() method checks if the current ObjectGuid instance
    corresponds to a scene object, which are special game entities used for visual
    effects, scripted events, or dynamic environments in TrinityCore. Scene objects
    typically have unique identifiers that distinguish them from regular game objects
    like players, creatures, or items. This method evaluates the GUID's type and flags
    to determine if it belongs to the scene object category. The check is performed
    efficiently without requiring additional database lookups or complex logic. This
    functionality is essential for systems that need to differentiate between standard
    game objects and scene-specific entities during event handling, visual scripting,
    or environment management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a scene object; otherwise returns
    false. Scene objects are identified by specific bit patterns or type flags within
    the GUID structure that indicate their special nature in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Scene Object
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Scene>(0, 12345);\nif (guid.IsSceneObject())\
      \ {\n    // Handle scene object specific logic\n    printf(\"This is a scene\
      \ object\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle regular object logic\n    printf(\"\
      This is not a scene object\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Scene Object Filtering in Event System
    code: "void ProcessGameObjects(std::vector<ObjectGuid>& objects) {\n    for (const\
      \ auto& guid : objects) {\n        if (guid.IsSceneObject()) {\n           \
      \ // Apply scene-specific processing\n            HandleSceneObjectEvent(guid);\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Apply standard object processing\n       \
      \     HandleRegularObjectEvent(guid);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a bitwise check on the ObjectGuid's internal representation
    to determine if it matches the scene object type. It does not require any external
    data access or database queries, making it very efficient for frequent checks.
    The implementation relies on the HighGuid enum values and specific bit patterns
    that are defined in TrinityCore's GUID management system.
  warnings: Developers should be aware that scene objects may behave differently from
    regular game objects in terms of update cycles, visibility rules, and event handling.
    Incorrectly treating a scene object as a regular object can lead to unexpected
    behavior or performance issues. Additionally, scene objects are typically not
    persistent across server restarts and may have limited lifecycle management compared
    to standard entities.
