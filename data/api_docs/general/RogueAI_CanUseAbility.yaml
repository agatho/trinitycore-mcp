  class: RogueAI
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool RogueAI::CanUseAbility(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a rogue AI can use a specified ability based on current
    game state and conditions.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a rogue AI character is eligible
    to cast or activate a specific spell or ability. It checks various prerequisites
    such as mana availability, cooldown status, target validity, and other combat-related
    conditions that must be met before an ability can be used. This method is typically
    called during the AI's decision-making process to ensure only valid actions are
    attempted. The evaluation considers both immediate requirements (like resource
    costs) and contextual factors (such as enemy position or player state).
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability to check for usability.
      This corresponds to the Spell ID defined in the game's spell database.
  returns: Returns true if the rogue AI can use the specified ability under current
    conditions; otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that one
    or more prerequisites are not satisfied, such as insufficient mana, active cooldown,
    invalid target, or other restrictive conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (rogueAI->CanUseAbility(1752)) {\n    // Proceed with using Sinister\
      \ Strike\n    rogueAI->DoAction(ACTION_USE_ABILITY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Usage
    code: "uint32 ability = 1752; // Sinister Strike\nif (rogueAI->CanUseAbility(ability))\
      \ {\n    rogueAI->CastSpell(ability);\n} else if (rogueAI->CanUseAbility(1765))\
      \ { // Cheap Shot\n    rogueAI->CastSpell(1765);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during AI update cycles to ensure
    real-time decision-making. It may internally query the AI's current target, health,
    mana levels, and spell cooldowns. Performance is generally good but excessive
    calls without caching could impact frame rate in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value guarantees successful ability execution;
    additional checks like line-of-sight or target validity may still be required
    post-check. Also, this method does not validate if the spell is actually learned
    by the rogue; it only evaluates whether conditions are met for usage.
