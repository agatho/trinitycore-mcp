documentation:
  brief: Publishes a loot event to all registered listeners in the loot event system
  description: The PublishEvent method dispatches a LootEvent to all subscribers of
    the loot event bus. This method is used within the TrinityCore framework to notify
    various systems (such as loot managers, achievement handlers, or logging systems)
    when a loot event occurs. The method returns true if the event was successfully
    published to at least one listener, and false if no listeners were registered
    or if the publication failed for any reason. This method is typically called during
    game events such as mob death, chest opening, or quest reward distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the event was successfully published to at least one listener;
    false if no listeners are registered or if the event could not be published
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot Event Publication
    code: "LootEvent event;\nevent.type = LOOT_TYPE_ITEM;\nevent.itemId = 12345;\n\
      event.quantity = 1;\nbool success = lootEventBus.PublishEvent(event);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Event was published successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    event bus maintains a list of registered listeners that are notified in the order
    they were subscribed. Performance considerations include avoiding frequent calls
    to this method during high-frequency events such as mass loot drops.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or uninitialized LootEvent objects,
    as it may cause undefined behavior. Ensure all required fields in the LootEvent
    structure are properly set before publishing.
