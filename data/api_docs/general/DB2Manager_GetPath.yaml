documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a path definition from the database by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetPath method retrieves a PathDb2 structure that contains the
    definition of a specific path in the game world, identified by its pathId. This
    method is typically used to access pre-defined navigation paths for creatures
    or objects within the TrinityCore framework. The returned pointer provides access
    to path data such as waypoints and movement behavior. The method performs a lookup
    in an internal database cache and returns a const pointer to avoid modification
    of the cached data. If the specified pathId does not exist, the method will return
    a null pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a PathDb2 structure containing the path definition for
    the given pathId, or nullptr if no such path exists in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use a path definition
    code: "const PathDb2* path = sDB2Manager->GetPath(12345);\nif (path)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use path data\n    printf(\"Path waypoints: %u\\n\", path->WaypointCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a cached database lookup and is optimized for frequent
    calls. The returned PathDb2 structure should not be modified as it represents
    shared data within the DB2Manager's internal cache.
