documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ConditionMgr instance and cleans up all associated condition
    data.
  description: The ~ConditionMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all memory and resources allocated by the ConditionMgr singleton. This method
    ensures that any dynamically allocated condition structures, lists, or caches
    are freed to prevent memory leaks. It is automatically invoked when the ConditionMgr
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor typically
    iterates through internal data structures containing conditions and releases their
    memory, ensuring no dangling pointers remain. This cleanup is crucial for maintaining
    stable server performance and preventing resource exhaustion during long-running
    server sessions.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ConditionMgr instance
    code: 'ConditionMgr* mgr = new ConditionMgr();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete mgr; // Destructor automatically called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The ConditionMgr destructor is part of the singleton pattern implementation,
    so it's typically only called once during server shutdown. Developers should not
    manually invoke this destructor unless they are explicitly managing the lifecycle
    of a ConditionMgr instance outside of the normal singleton flow.
