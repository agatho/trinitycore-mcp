documentation:
  brief: Handles cooldown events for bot AI behavior
  description: The OnCooldownEvent method processes cooldown-related events within
    the BotAI system, allowing bots to respond appropriately when abilities or actions
    enter or exit their cooldown periods. This method is typically invoked by the
    game's cooldown management system and enables bots to update their internal state,
    queue actions, or modify decision-making logic based on available resources. The
    method ensures that bot behavior remains synchronized with the game's timing mechanics
    and prevents actions from being executed before their cooldowns expire.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic cooldown event handling
    code: "void BotAI::OnCooldownEvent(const CooldownEvent& event)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ the cooldown event\n    if (event.type == COOLDOWN_TYPE_SPELL)\n    {\n  \
      \      m_spellCooldowns[event.spellId] = event.endTime;\n        UpdateBotBehavior();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from the game's main update loop and should not perform
    heavy computations. It's designed to be lightweight and responsive to maintain
    optimal bot performance. The method may be invoked multiple times per second during
    active gameplay.
  warnings: Do not modify the event object directly as it may cause unexpected behavior.
    Ensure that all cooldown-related state updates are thread-safe if the method is
    called from multiple threads.
