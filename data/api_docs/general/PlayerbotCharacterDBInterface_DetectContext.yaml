  class: PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
  method: DetectContext
  signature: ExecutionContext PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::DetectContext() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the current execution context of the player bot character
    database interface.
  description: The DetectContext method analyzes the internal state of the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
    to identify and return the current execution context. This context typically represents
    the operational mode or state in which the database interface is functioning,
    such as whether it's in a transactional state, idle, or processing specific player
    data operations. The method is crucial for maintaining proper state management
    within the bot character database system, ensuring that operations are performed
    under correct conditions and preventing potential conflicts or inconsistencies
    in data handling. This functionality supports the overall integrity of player
    bot character data persistence and retrieval mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ExecutionContext enum value indicating the current operational context
    of the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface. Possible values may include IDLE, TRANSACTION_ACTIVE,
    DATA_ACCESS, or other context-specific states that define how the interface should
    behave during database operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Context Detection
    code: "PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface dbInterface;\nExecutionContext context =\
      \ dbInterface.DetectContext();\nif (context == ExecutionContext::IDLE) {\n \
      \   // Perform idle operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot system to determine
    appropriate handling of database operations. The implementation likely examines
    internal flags or state variables within the interface object to make its determination.
