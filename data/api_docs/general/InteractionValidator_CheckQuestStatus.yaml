  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CheckQuestStatus(::Player * bot, uint32 questId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has completed a specific quest and returns true if the
    quest is complete.
  description: The CheckQuestStatus method evaluates whether a given player has completed
    a specified quest in the World of Warcraft game. It verifies the quest's completion
    status within the player's quest log, ensuring that all objectives have been fulfilled.
    This method is commonly used by AI systems or quest management modules to determine
    if a player can proceed with quest-related interactions or rewards. The method
    does not modify any state but simply returns a boolean value indicating the quest's
    completion status.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      status is being checked.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest to check for completion. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest is completed by the player, otherwise
    returns false. A return value of false may indicate that the quest is not accepted,
    in progress, or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Status Check
    code: "if (validator.CheckQuestStatus(player, 12345)) {\n    // Player has completed\
      \ quest 12345\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interaction Based on Quest Status
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nif (!validator.CheckQuestStatus(player, questId))\
      \ {\n    // Player hasn't completed the quest yet\n    player->SendQuestFailed(questId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Quest is complete, award rewards\n    player->RewardQuest(questId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current quest log and does not perform
    any database queries directly. It assumes that the player object is valid and
    properly initialized. The method may return false for quests that are not in the
    player's active quest log, even if they were previously completed.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid segmentation faults. Also note that this method only checks for completion
    status; it does not verify whether a quest is currently available or can be accepted.
