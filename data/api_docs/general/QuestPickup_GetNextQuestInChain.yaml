  class: QuestPickup
  method: GetNextQuestInChain
  signature: uint32 QuestPickup::GetNextQuestInChain(uint32 currentQuestId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quest ID of the next quest in the chain following the specified
    current quest ID.
  description: The GetNextQuestInChain method is used to determine the subsequent
    quest in a sequential quest chain within the World of Warcraft game. This function
    takes a quest ID as input and returns the identifier of the next quest that should
    be available to the player after completing the given quest. It is commonly used
    in quest handling systems to manage quest progression, ensure proper quest availability,
    and maintain logical flow between related quests. The method relies on internal
    quest chain data structures maintained by the TrinityCore server to determine
    the correct next quest in the sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the unique identifier (ID) of the next quest in the chain. If the
    specified quest is the last in the chain or if no next quest exists, it returns
    0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Next Quest
    code: "uint32 currentQuestId = 12345;\nuint32 nextQuestId = player->GetNextQuestInChain(currentQuestId);\n\
      if (nextQuestId != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest progression logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Next quest in chain: %u\", nextQuestId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No next quest available\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"No next quest in chain.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of the TrinityCore quest system and
    requires that quest data is properly loaded in the database. The quest chain information
    must be correctly defined in the quest_template table with appropriate quest relationships
    to ensure accurate results.
  warnings: Ensure that the input quest ID corresponds to a valid quest in the database;
    otherwise, incorrect behavior or undefined results may occur. This method should
    not be called during quest initialization phases where quest data might not yet
    be fully loaded.
