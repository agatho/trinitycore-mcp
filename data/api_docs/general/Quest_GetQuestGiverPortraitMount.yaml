  signature: int32 Quest::GetQuestGiverPortraitMount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the portrait mount ID associated with the quest giver for this quest.
  description: This method retrieves the specific mount ID that is used to display
    the portrait of the quest giver in the game world. It is typically used when a
    player interacts with a quest givers or when the quest's portrait information
    needs to be accessed for visual representation purposes. The returned value corresponds
    to a mount that can be used in the game UI to represent the quest giver's portrait,
    and it usually relates to the specific quest's requirements or rewards. This method
    does not require any parameters and is intended to provide information about the
    quest giver's mount representation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the mount ID used for the quest giver's
    portrait. A value of 0 indicates no mount is associated with the quest giver,
    while positive values represent valid mount IDs that can be used in the game UI.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 mountID = quest->GetQuestGiverPortraitMount();\nif (mountID > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Use mountID to display portrait\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine the visual representation of a quest giver. It may be affected by
    game mechanics such as player level requirements or quest completion status. Performance
    considerations are minimal, but it's important to note that this method should
    only be called when necessary since it involves accessing internal data structures.
  warnings: This method should not be used in situations where the quest giver is
    not properly initialized or when the quest has not been set up correctly. It may
    return invalid values if the quest's portrait mount hasn't been assigned yet,
    which could lead to incorrect UI behavior.
