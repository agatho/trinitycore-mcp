  class: ChannelMgr
  method: CreateCustomChannel
  signature: Channel * ChannelMgr::CreateCustomChannel(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new custom channel with the specified name and returns a pointer
    to the Channel object.
  description: The CreateCustomChannel method is responsible for creating a new chat
    channel in the TrinityCore server environment. It takes a string parameter representing
    the desired name of the channel and attempts to create it within the system. If
    successful, it returns a pointer to the newly created Channel object; otherwise,
    it may return nullptr. This method is typically used by game systems or scripts
    that need to dynamically generate new communication channels for players, such
    as guild channels, group channels, or custom event-based channels. The created
    channel will be managed by the ChannelMgr and can be accessed through standard
    channel operations like joining, leaving, sending messages, etc.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The name of the custom channel to be created. Must be a valid string
      that conforms to the server's naming rules for channels. The name should not
      be empty and typically must not contain special characters or spaces depending
      on server configuration.
  returns: A pointer to the newly created Channel object if successful, or nullptr
    if the channel creation failed due to invalid parameters, name conflicts, or other
    system limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Channel* customChannel = channelMgr->CreateCustomChannel(\"MyCustomChannel\"\
      );\nif (customChannel != nullptr) {\n    // Channel was successfully created\n\
      \    customChannel->JoinChannel(player, \"password\");\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to create channel\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to create custom channel\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Channels
    code: "std::vector<Channel*> channels;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\n    std::string\
      \ channelName = \"EventChannel\" + std::to_string(i);\n    Channel* channel\
      \ = channelMgr->CreateCustomChannel(channelName);\n    if (channel != nullptr)\
      \ {\n        channels.push_back(channel);\n    }\n}\n// Now all channels are\
      \ created and can be used for events"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ChannelMgr instance is properly initialized
    and that the server has sufficient resources to create new channels. The returned
    Channel pointer must be managed carefully, as it's owned by the ChannelMgr and
    should not be manually deleted. If a channel with the same name already exists,
    this method may return nullptr or handle the conflict based on server configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or empty channel name will likely
    result in failure and a null return value. Developers should always check for
    null returns before using the returned Channel pointer to avoid segmentation faults.
    Additionally, excessive use of dynamic channel creation can impact server performance
    if not properly managed.
