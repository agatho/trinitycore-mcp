api:
  class: ProfessionManager
  method: QueueCraft
  signature: void ProfessionManager::QueueCraft(int * player, uint32 recipeId, uint32
    quantity)
documentation:
  brief: Queues a crafting operation for the specified player using the given recipe
    and quantity.
  description: The QueueCraft method schedules a crafting task for a player within
    the TrinityCore framework. It takes a pointer to a player object, a recipe identifier,
    and a quantity to craft. This function is typically used in conjunction with the
    profession system to manage crafting queues, ensuring that players can queue multiple
    items for crafting without immediate execution. The method does not directly execute
    the craft but adds it to an internal queue for processing by the game's crafting
    system. It is essential for maintaining proper synchronization between client
    and server when handling crafting operations.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who will perform
      the crafting operation. Must not be null.
  - name: recipeId
    description: Unique identifier for the crafting recipe to be queued. This corresponds
      to entries in the game's recipe database.
  - name: quantity
    description: Number of items to craft. Must be a positive integer representing
      how many times the recipe should be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Crafting Queue Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 recipeId = 12345;

      uint32 quantity = 2;

      ProfessionManager::QueueCraft(&player, recipeId, quantity);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Queuing Multiple Recipes
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      ProfessionManager::QueueCraft(&player, 1001, 1);

      ProfessionManager::QueueCraft(&player, 1002, 3);

      ProfessionManager::QueueCraft(&player, 1003, 5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has sufficient resources and skill level
    to craft the specified item. The actual crafting process may be delayed due to
    server load or other queued operations. This function is part of a larger system
    designed to handle concurrent crafting requests efficiently.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will lead to undefined behavior. Also, verify that the
    recipeId exists in the database; otherwise, the crafting operation may fail silently
    or cause errors during execution.
