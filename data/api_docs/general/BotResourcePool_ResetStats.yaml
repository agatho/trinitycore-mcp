documentation:
  brief: Resets all resource statistics for the bot to their initial state.
  description: The ResetStats method clears and reinitializes all tracking statistics
    within the BotResourcePool. This includes resetting counters, timers, and any
    accumulated resource data that may have been modified during bot operation. The
    method ensures a clean slate for subsequent resource management operations by
    clearing internal state variables and restoring default values. It is typically
    invoked when a bot needs to be reset to its original configuration or when starting
    a new session with fresh statistics.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotResourcePool pool;

      pool.ResetStats(); // Resets all internal resource statistics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it will discard any existing resource
    tracking data. It's recommended to call this before initializing a new bot session
    or after completing a significant operational cycle where old statistics are no
    longer relevant.
