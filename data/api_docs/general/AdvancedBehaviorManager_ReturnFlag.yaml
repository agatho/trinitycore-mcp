documentation:
  brief: Returns a dropped flag to its original location in battlegrounds.
  description: The ReturnFlag method is responsible for handling the return of a captured
    or dropped flag back to its starting position during battleground gameplay. This
    method typically gets invoked when a player successfully captures a flag and then
    returns it to the base, or when a flag needs to be reset due to time expiration
    or other game conditions. The method ensures proper synchronization of flag state
    across the server and clients, updating object positions and resetting flag ownership.
    It is commonly used in battlegrounds such as Warsong Gulch or Arathi Basin where
    flag capture mechanics are implemented.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flag Return Usage
    code: "void MyBattlegroundAI::OnFlagCapture(Player* player)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ flag capture logic\n    // ...\n    \n    // Return the flag to base\n   \
      \ m_behaviorManager.ReturnFlag();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active battleground gameplay when
    flag mechanics are enabled. The implementation likely involves updating GameObject
    positions, resetting flag states, and notifying all players in the battleground
    of the flag's return.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid battleground context may result
    in undefined behavior or server errors. Ensure that the battleground is properly
    initialized before invoking this method.
