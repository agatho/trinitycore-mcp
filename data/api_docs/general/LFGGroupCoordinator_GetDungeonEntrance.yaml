  signature: bool LFGGroupCoordinator::GetDungeonEntrance(uint32 dungeonId, uint32
    & mapId, float & x, float & y, float & z, float & orientation) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the entrance coordinates and map information for a specified dungeon
    ID.
  description: The GetDungeonEntrance method retrieves the map identifier, as well
    as the X, Y, Z coordinates and orientation of the entrance point for a given dungeon.
    This is used internally by the LFG (Looking For Group) system to determine where
    players should be teleported when joining a dungeon group. The method returns
    true if the dungeon ID is valid and the entrance data is successfully retrieved,
    otherwise it returns false. It's commonly used in conjunction with dungeon selection
    and teleportation logic within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeonId
    description: The unique identifier of the dungeon for which to retrieve entrance
      information. This value corresponds to the ID field in the dbc files or database
      entries related to dungeons.
  - name: mapId
    description: Reference parameter that will be filled with the map identifier where
      the dungeon entrance is located.
  - name: x
    description: Reference parameter that will be filled with the X coordinate of
      the dungeon entrance position.
  - name: y
    description: Reference parameter that will be filled with the Y coordinate of
      the dungeon entrance position.
  - name: z
    description: Reference parameter that will be filled with the Z coordinate of
      the dungeon entrance position.
  - name: orientation
    description: Reference parameter that will be filled with the orientation angle
      (in radians) of the dungeon entrance.
  returns: True if the dungeon ID is valid and entrance data was successfully retrieved;
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate an invalid dungeon ID or
    missing data in the system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Dungeon Entrance Coordinates
    code: "uint32 dungeonId = 1234;\nuint32 mapId;\nfloat x, y, z, orientation;\n\n\
      if (LFGGroupCoordinator::GetDungeonEntrance(dungeonId, mapId, x, y, z, orientation))\
      \ {\n    // Successfully retrieved entrance data\n    printf(\"Dungeon %u entrance\
      \ at Map:%u, X:%.2f, Y:%.2f, Z:%.2f, Orientation:%.2f\\n\",\n           dungeonId,\
      \ mapId, x, y, z, orientation);\n} else {\n    // Failed to retrieve entrance\
      \ data\n    printf(\"Failed to get entrance for dungeon %u\\n\", dungeonId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and relies on internal dungeon definitions
    stored in game databases or DBC files. It's designed to be thread-safe as it only
    reads from static data structures. The method assumes that all referenced dungeon
    IDs are valid within the context of the current TrinityCore instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided dungeonId is valid before calling this method,
    otherwise the output parameters may contain garbage values or undefined behavior.
    This method should not be used outside of LFG-related systems unless you're certain
    about the validity of the dungeon ID.
