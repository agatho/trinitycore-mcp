  class: BotAI
  method: SetTarget
  signature: void BotAI::SetTarget(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target for the bot AI to the specified GUID.
  description: The SetTarget method assigns a target to the bot's AI system using
    a globally unique identifier (GUID). This method is typically used in World of
    Warcraft TrinityCore environments where bots need to engage or follow specific
    entities such as players, creatures, or game objects. The target GUID should correspond
    to an existing entity within the game world. When called, this method updates
    the internal state of the BotAI instance to reflect the new target, which may
    influence subsequent AI behavior decisions like movement, combat actions, or interaction
    patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the entity to set as the
      bot's target. This value must correspond to a valid object in the game world
      such as a player, creature, or game object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotAI* ai = ...;

      ai->SetTarget(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Target Based on Player GUID
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      BotAI* ai = ...;

      ai->SetTarget(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the provided GUID corresponds to an
    actual entity in the game world. It is assumed that the caller ensures the GUID
    refers to a valid target before invoking this method. The implementation likely
    updates internal AI state variables and may trigger event handlers or behavior
    recalculations.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent GUID can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes within the AI system. Always verify that the GUID represents a live
    entity in the game world prior to calling SetTarget.
