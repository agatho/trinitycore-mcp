  class: ChrSpecializationEntry
  method: GetRole
  signature: ChrSpecializationRole ChrSpecializationEntry::GetRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the role associated with this character specialization.
  description: The GetRole method returns the ChrSpecializationRole enum value that
    defines the primary role of this character specialization. In World of Warcraft,
    each specialization has an assigned role such as Tank, Healer, or Damage Dealer
    (DPS). This information is used by the game engine to determine how abilities
    and talents should behave in different combat scenarios, and it affects UI elements
    like role icons and talent tree layouts. The method does not perform any calculations
    or lookups; it simply returns a pre-defined value stored within the specialization
    entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ChrSpecializationRole enum value indicating the role of this specialization.
    Possible values include TANK, HEALER, and DAMAGE, though the exact enumeration
    may vary depending on the game version and expansion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Role
    code: "ChrSpecializationEntry* specEntry = sChrSpecializationStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (specEntry)\n{\n    ChrSpecializationRole role = specEntry->GetRole();\n\
      \    if (role == ChrSpecializationRole::DAMAGE)\n        printf(\"This specialization\
      \ is for DPS.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned role value is determined at compile time based on the game's
    static data files and does not change during runtime. This method is thread-safe
    as it only reads from immutable data structures.
