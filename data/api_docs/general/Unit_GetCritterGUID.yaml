documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the unit's critter
  description: The GetCritterGUID method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the critter associated with the unit. This method is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to access the GUID of a unit's summoned
    creature or pet. The returned GUID represents the identifier of the critter, which
    may be used for various game mechanics such as tracking, targeting, or interaction
    with other objects in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the critter. This value is
    typically a unique identifier that corresponds to a specific creature or pet within
    the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetCritter();

      int guid = unit->GetCritterGUID();

      // guid now contains the critter''s GUID'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Unit class and should be used carefully in contexts
    where critter objects are involved. It may return zero if no critter is associated
    with the unit, which can indicate an empty or invalid state.
  warnings: This method should not be called on units that do not have a critter associated
    with them, as it may result in undefined behavior or invalid GUID values.
