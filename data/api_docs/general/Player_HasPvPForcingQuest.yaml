documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player has a PvP forcing quest active.
  description: This method checks if the player currently has a PvP forcing quest,
    which is a quest that requires the player to engage in PvP combat. The method
    returns true if such a quest is active and false otherwise. This functionality
    is important for determining when a player can be flagged for PvP or when they
    are under the effects of a PvP forcing quest that prevents them from being able
    to enter certain zones or perform certain actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has a PvP forcing quest active, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player is currently subject to the restrictions imposed
    by a PvP forcing quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->HasPvPForcingQuest())\n{\n    // Player is currently flagged\
      \ for PvP\n    // Do not allow player to enter cities or safe zones\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Player is not flagged for PvP\n    // Allow normal gameplay\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks the player's current quest status and may involve
    checking for specific quest IDs or conditions that indicate a PvP forcing quest.
    Implementation details may vary based on how TrinityCore handles quest tracking
    and player flags.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects gameplay mechanics
    related to PvP flagging and zone restrictions. Incorrect usage could lead to players
    being able to enter restricted zones when they shouldn't be able to.
