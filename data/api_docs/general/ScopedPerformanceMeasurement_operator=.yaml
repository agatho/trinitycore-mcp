  brief: Moves ownership of a ScopedPerformanceMeasurement object to another instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers the resources managed by the
    source ScopedPerformanceMeasurement object to the current object, leaving the
    source in a valid but unspecified state. This operation is typically used to efficiently
    transfer performance measurement data without unnecessary copying. The ScopedPerformanceMeasurement
    class is designed to track performance metrics and timing information within the
    TrinityCore framework, often used for profiling subsystems or monitoring server
    performance. When move assignment occurs, any existing performance measurements
    in the target object are replaced by those from the source, and the source object
    becomes reset to its default state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current ScopedPerformanceMeasurement object after the
    move operation has completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'ScopedPerformanceMeasurement perf1;

      // ... perform some measurements ...

      ScopedPerformanceMeasurement perf2 = std::move(perf1); // Move perf1''s data
      to perf2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Function Context
    code: "ScopedPerformanceMeasurement createPerformanceTracker() {\n    ScopedPerformanceMeasurement\
      \ tracker;\n    // ... setup performance tracking ...\n    return tracker; //\
      \ Move semantics allow efficient return\n}\n\nauto tracker = createPerformanceTracker();\
      \ // Uses move assignment"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should
    only be called on rvalue expressions or explicitly with std::move(). The performance
    measurement data is transferred efficiently without copying, which is particularly
    important in high-frequency profiling scenarios. After move assignment, the source
    object remains in a valid state but its contents are undefined.
  warnings: Using move assignment on an already moved-from object may lead to undefined
    behavior if the implementation does not properly handle such cases. Ensure that
    objects are not used after being moved from unless explicitly reset or reassigned.
