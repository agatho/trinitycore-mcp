  method: GetGroupCoordinator
  signature: GroupCoordinator * LazyManagerFactory::GetGroupCoordinator()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GroupCoordinator instance managed by this LazyManagerFactory.
  description: The GetGroupCoordinator method returns a pointer to the GroupCoordinator
    object that is lazily initialized and managed by the LazyManagerFactory. This
    coordinator is responsible for handling group-related operations such as managing
    group membership, coordinating group actions, and maintaining group state information.
    The method ensures that only one instance of GroupCoordinator exists within the
    factory's scope, following the singleton pattern principles. It is typically used
    by subsystems that require access to group coordination functionality without
    directly instantiating or managing the coordinator themselves.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the GroupCoordinator instance managed by this factory. Returns
    nullptr if the coordinator has not been initialized yet and cannot be created
    due to system constraints or initialization errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = factory->GetGroupCoordinator();\nif (coordinator\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the group coordinator for group operations\n  \
      \  coordinator->AddMember(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access Pattern
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = factory->GetGroupCoordinator();\nif (coordinator\
      \ == nullptr)\n{\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to retrieve GroupCoordinator from LazyManagerFactory\");\n    return\
      \ false;\n}\n// Proceed with group operations using the coordinator\nreturn\
      \ true;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements lazy initialization, meaning the GroupCoordinator
    instance is only created when first requested. The factory maintains ownership
    of the returned pointer and manages its lifetime. This approach prevents unnecessary
    instantiation of group coordination components until they are actually needed.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if the coordinator cannot be initialized
    due to system resource constraints or other initialization failures. Always check
    for null before using the returned pointer to avoid segmentation faults or undefined
    behavior.
