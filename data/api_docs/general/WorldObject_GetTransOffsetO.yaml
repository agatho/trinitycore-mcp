  method: GetTransOffsetO
  signature: float WorldObject::GetTransOffsetO() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the orientation offset of the object during transport movement.
  description: The GetTransOffsetO method retrieves the orientation (rotation) offset
    value of a WorldObject when it is being transported by another object, such as
    a vehicle or a moving platform. This value represents the local orientation of
    the object relative to its transport parent and is used in calculations for positioning
    and rotation during transport updates. The returned value is typically expressed
    in radians and corresponds to the Z-axis rotation component (yaw) of the object's
    offset within its transport context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the orientation offset in radians. This value
    indicates how much the object's local orientation deviates from its parent transport's
    orientation along the Z-axis.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log transport orientation offset
    code: 'float offset = unit->GetTransOffsetO();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("entities.unit", "Transport orientation offset: {} radians", offset);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use transport offset in rotation calculations
    code: 'float currentO = transportUnit->GetTransOffsetO();

      float adjustedRotation = player->GetOrientation() + currentO;

      player->SetOrientation(adjustedRotation);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore movement system
    when handling objects that are mounted on transports. The orientation offset is
    updated during transport movement updates and reflects the object's local rotation
    relative to its parent transport. It should not be confused with the global orientation
    of the object itself.
  warnings: The returned value may be zero if the object is not currently being transported
    or if no offset has been set. This method should only be called on objects that
    are actually part of a transport system, otherwise it may return unexpected values.
