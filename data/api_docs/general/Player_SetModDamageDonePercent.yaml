  class: Player
  method: SetModDamageDonePercent
  signature: void Player::SetModDamageDonePercent(uint8 school, float pct)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the percentage modifier for damage done in a specific school.
  description: This method modifies the damage percentage applied to a player's attacks
    or spells in a specified magical school. It affects how much additional or reduced
    damage is applied to the player's damage output, typically used for adjusting
    damage modifiers like buffs or debuffs. The method directly influences the player's
    damage calculation by modifying the percentage applied to their damage done in
    that specific school.
  parameters:
  - name: school
    description: The magical school (0-7) to modify, where 0 represents physical damage
      and 1-6 represent different elemental schools (fire, nature, frost, shadow,
      arcane, holy).
  - name: pct
    description: The percentage modifier value (positive or negative) that will be
      applied to the damage done in the specified school.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetModDamageDonePercent(0, 10.0f); // Set physical damage done to increase
      by 10%

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetModDamageDonePercent(3, -5.0f); // Reduce shadow damage done by 5%

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's damage done percentage in the
    specified school. It should be used carefully as it affects all damage calculations
    for that school. The method is typically used in conjunction with other damage-related
    methods to adjust overall damage output.
  warnings: This method may cause unexpected behavior if used incorrectly, particularly
    when modifying damage done percentages for schools that are not properly defined
    or handled. Care should be taken when applying negative percentage modifiers as
    they can reduce damage below zero.
