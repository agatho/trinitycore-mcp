api:
  class: Player
  method: SetGuildLevel
  signature: void Player::SetGuildLevel(uint32 level)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the guild level for the player to the specified level.
  description: This method updates the player's guild level to the provided value,
    which determines the player's rank within their guild organization. The guild
    level is typically used in conjunction with other guild-related functions to manage
    player roles and permissions within the guild. This function does not directly
    affect the player's character level or experience points, but rather modifies
    the guild-specific attributes that control access to guild commands and benefits.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The guild level to set for the player. Valid values range from 1
      to 10, representing different ranks within the guild hierarchy. Level 1 corresponds
      to the lowest rank (initiate), while level 10 represents the highest rank (guild
      master).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Guild Level
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetGuildLevel(5);

      // Sets the player''s guild level to 5, which corresponds to a rank of ''officer'''
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other guild management
    functions and may require synchronization with the guild's internal state. The
    function does not trigger any immediate updates to the player's guild permissions
    or commands, but rather sets the level for future reference.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as setting an invalid guild level (outside
    of 1-10 range) can cause issues with guild permissions and may result in unexpected
    behavior within the guild system. Ensure that the level value corresponds to valid
    guild ranks before calling this function.
