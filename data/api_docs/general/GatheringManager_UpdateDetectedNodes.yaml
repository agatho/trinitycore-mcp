documentation:
  brief: Updates the list of detected gathering nodes for the player
  description: The UpdateDetectedNodes method refreshes the internal tracking of gathering
    resources (such as herbs, ores, and nodes) that are currently visible to a player
    within their detection range. This method is typically invoked during player movement
    or when the game state changes to ensure that the player's UI accurately reflects
    available resources. It processes the current world state to identify and register
    new nodes while removing those no longer in range or no longer valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Update Loop
    code: "void Player::Update() {\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    gatheringManager.UpdateDetectedNodes();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically by the game loop and should not
    be invoked manually unless implementing custom behavior. The performance impact
    is generally low as it only processes nodes within a defined detection radius.
