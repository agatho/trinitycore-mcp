  signature: void Map::SetZoneOverrideLight(uint32 zoneId, uint32 areaLightId, uint32
    overrideLightId, int transitionTime)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the override light for a specific zone and area.
  description: This method allows setting a custom light override for a specified
    zone and area within the game world. It enables developers to control lighting
    conditions in specific regions, which can be useful for creating special effects
    or modifying environmental lighting during events. The transition time parameter
    controls how long it takes for the light change to take effect. This method is
    part of the Map class functionality and relates to World of Warcraft's lighting
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The zone identifier where the light override should be applied. Valid
      values are typically 0-10000, representing different zones in the game world.
  - name: areaLightId
    description: The area light identifier that defines which specific area within
      the zone should have its lighting overridden. This is usually a value between
      0-10000 representing different areas or regions.
  - name: overrideLightId
    description: The override light identifier that specifies what light effect should
      be applied to the zone/area. This can be any valid light ID in the game's lighting
      system, typically ranging from 0-10000.
  - name: transitionTime
    description: The transition time in milliseconds for how long it takes for the
      light override to take effect. This controls the duration of the light change,
      with values typically ranging from 0-30000.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = World::GetMap(0);

      map->SetZoneOverrideLight(1234, 5678, 9012, 2000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with multiple zones
    code: 'Map* map = World::GetMap(0);

      map->SetZoneOverrideLight(1234, 5678, 9012, 2000);

      map->SetZoneOverrideLight(1235, 5679, 9013, 3000);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the lighting system in
    game world. It may impact performance if used excessively or with large transition
    times. The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause lighting glitches or visual artifacts
    in game world. Avoid setting invalid light IDs or zone/area combinations that
    don't exist in the game world. Be cautious with transition times as they can affect
    game performance.
