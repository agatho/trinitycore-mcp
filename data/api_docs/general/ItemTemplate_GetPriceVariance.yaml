  signature: float ItemTemplate::GetPriceVariance() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the price variance factor for the item template.
  description: The GetPriceVariance method computes a float value representing the
    relative price fluctuation or variance associated with an item template. This
    value is typically used in the context of auction house pricing, vendor pricing,
    or dynamic market systems within World of Warcraft's economy. The variance factor
    can influence how much an item's price may deviate from its base value during
    transactions. This method does not take any parameters and returns a constant
    float value that reflects the inherent price volatility of the item type.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the price variance factor for the item template.
    This value is typically between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no variance and
    higher values indicate greater price fluctuation potential.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      float variance = itemTemplate->GetPriceVariance();

      printf("Price variance for item %u is %.2f\n", itemTemplate->ItemId, variance);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal item template data fields that define
    price behavior. The returned value may be precomputed or dynamically calculated
    based on item type, rarity, or other factors. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with price calculation functions for auction house mechanics.
