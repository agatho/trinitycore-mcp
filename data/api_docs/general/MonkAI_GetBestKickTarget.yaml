  class: MonkAI
  method: GetBestKickTarget
  signature: int * MonkAI::GetBestKickTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the most optimal target for the Monk's Kick ability based
    on AI decision-making logic.
  description: The GetBestKickTarget method determines and returns the unique identifier
    (GUID) of the enemy target that is considered most suitable for using the Monk's
    Kick ability. This selection process takes into account various factors such as
    target proximity, threat level, and combat priority within the AI's decision framework.
    The returned GUID can be used to validate or execute the Kick ability against
    the selected target. This method is typically invoked during the Monk's AI update
    cycle when determining optimal abilities to use in combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the best target for Kick,
    or nullptr if no suitable target exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int* targetGuid = monkAI->GetBestKickTarget();\nif (targetGuid != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Execute Kick ability on the target\n    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me,\
      \ *targetGuid);\n    if (target)\n        me->CastSpell(target, 100780, true);\
      \ // Kick spell ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs internal AI logic to evaluate potential targets and may
    return nullptr if no valid target is found within the current combat context.
    The returned GUID should be validated before use as it might not correspond to
    an active unit.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned GUID is checked for null before dereferencing.
    Using an invalid or stale GUID can lead to crashes or undefined behavior when
    accessing the target unit.
