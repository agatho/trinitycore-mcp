  signature: int PhaseShift::RemoveUiMapPhaseId(uint32 uiMapPhaseId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a UI map phase ID from the phase shift manager
  description: The RemoveUiMapPhaseId method removes a specified UI map phase ID from
    the current phase shift context. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore to manage visual phase states for players, particularly when certain
    UI elements or map phases need to be disabled or removed from the player's view.
    The method operates on the internal phase shift data structure and returns an
    integer indicating success or failure of the removal operation. It's commonly
    called during quest events, world state changes, or when transitioning between
    different game phases where specific UI elements should no longer be visible.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns 0 on successful removal of the UI map phase ID, or a non-zero value
    indicating failure or that the phase ID was not found in the current phase shift
    context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PhaseShift phaseShift;\nuint32 phaseId = 1234;\nint result = phaseShift.RemoveUiMapPhaseId(phaseId);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Phase ID successfully removed\n    printf(\"UI Map\
      \ Phase ID %u removed successfully\\n\", phaseId);\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to remove phase ID\n    printf(\"Failed to remove UI Map Phase ID %u\\n\"\
      , phaseId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PhaseShift system which manages how players perceive
    different game phases and visual states. The internal implementation likely involves
    checking against a set or list of active UI map phases, and may trigger updates
    to the client's phase state if changes are made. It's important to note that this
    method only affects UI-related phase information and does not modify core gameplay
    phases.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent UI map phase ID will
    likely return a failure code, but it's recommended to verify that the phase ID
    exists before calling this method to avoid unnecessary operations. Additionally,
    removing a phase ID that is actively used by other systems may cause unexpected
    visual artifacts in the client.
