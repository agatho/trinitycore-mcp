documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ResourceMonitor class for tracking system
    resource usage.
  description: The ResourceMonitor constructor initializes a new instance of the ResourceMonitor
    class. This class is designed to monitor and track various system resources such
    as memory usage, CPU utilization, and other performance metrics within the TrinityCore
    server environment. The initialization process sets up internal data structures
    and begins collecting baseline resource measurements. This method is typically
    called during server startup or when a new monitoring instance needs to be created
    for specific subsystems. No parameters are required for construction, and the
    method performs all necessary setup operations internally.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ResourceMonitor Initialization
    code: 'ResourceMonitor monitor;

      // This creates a new ResourceMonitor instance that begins tracking system resources

      // The monitor will start collecting data immediately upon construction'
    language: cpp
  notes: The ResourceMonitor class is typically used in server-side performance monitoring
    and debugging. It may be instantiated multiple times throughout the TrinityCore
    application lifecycle to monitor different subsystems or components independently.
    The constructor does not perform any heavy operations that would block execution,
    making it safe to call during normal server initialization.
