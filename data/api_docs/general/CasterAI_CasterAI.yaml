  class: CasterAI
  method: CasterAI
  signature: void CasterAI::CasterAI(Creature * creature, int scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CasterAI instance for a creature with the specified script
    ID.
  description: The CasterAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a creature
    that is designed to cast spells. This method sets up internal state and configuration
    based on the provided creature object and script identifier. The script ID typically
    corresponds to predefined spell casting behaviors or scripts defined in the TrinityCore
    database. This initialization is crucial for creatures that need to perform magical
    abilities, such as healing, damaging, or supporting other units during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that this AI will control. Must not
      be null and should represent a valid creature in the game world.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Integer identifier that specifies which script or behavior pattern
      the AI should follow. This value is used to determine spell casting patterns,
      cooldowns, and other AI-related behaviors defined in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CasterAI Initialization
    code: 'Creature* myCreature = ...; // Assume valid creature pointer

      int spellScriptId = 12345;

      CasterAI* ai = new CasterAI(myCreature, spellScriptId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor does not directly manage the creature's AI state; it prepares
    internal structures for later use by the AI system. The actual AI execution logic
    is handled separately through methods like UpdateAI(). Ensure that the provided
    creature pointer is valid and that the script ID maps to a defined spell casting
    behavior in the database.
