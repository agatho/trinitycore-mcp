  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: GetUpdateTime
  signature: uint32 AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetUpdateTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update time interval in milliseconds used by the adaptive behavior
    manager for AI processing.
  description: The GetUpdateTime method retrieves the current update interval value
    configured for the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This interval determines how frequently
    the AI system evaluates and updates the behavior of NPC creatures or game entities
    managed by this system. The returned value is expressed in milliseconds and represents
    the time between successive AI update cycles. This method is typically used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to control the timing of AI decision-making processes,
    ensuring that AI behaviors are updated at appropriate intervals without overloading
    the server with excessive processing overhead.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the update time interval in milliseconds. This
    value indicates how often the adaptive behavior manager should process AI updates
    for managed entities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;

      uint32 updateTime = behaviorManager->GetUpdateTime();

      printf("AI Update Interval: %u ms\n", updateTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI Update Logic
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_adaptiveBehaviorManager)\n\
      \    {\n        uint32 updateTime = m_adaptiveBehaviorManager->GetUpdateTime();\n\
      \        if (m_updateTimer <= diff)\n        {\n            m_adaptiveBehaviorManager->UpdateBehaviors();\n\
      \            m_updateTimer = updateTime;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n\
      \            m_updateTimer -= diff;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned value may vary depending on the specific configuration of the adaptive
    behavior manager instance, which could be influenced by server settings or runtime
    conditions. The update time interval directly impacts performance characteristics
    of AI processing, so it's important to consider this when tuning NPC behavior.
  warnings: Do not modify the return value as it's read-only. The value returned should
    not be used for direct timing calculations without considering potential configuration
    changes that might occur during runtime. In high-traffic server environments,
    frequent calls to this method may have minor performance implications due to internal
    state checks.
