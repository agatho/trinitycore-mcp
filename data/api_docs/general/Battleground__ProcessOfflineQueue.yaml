  method: _ProcessOfflineQueue
  signature: void Battleground::_ProcessOfflineQueue()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the offline queue for battleground players, handling disconnected
    or inactive participants.
  description: The _ProcessOfflineQueue method is an internal utility function within
    the Battleground class responsible for managing players who have gone offline
    during a battleground match. It iterates through the list of players in the offline
    queue and performs necessary cleanup operations such as removing them from the
    battleground, updating their status, and potentially awarding rewards or penalties
    based on their disconnection behavior. This method ensures that disconnected players
    do not interfere with ongoing gameplay and maintains the integrity of the battleground's
    state. The function typically executes during periodic updates or when specific
    conditions are met, such as a player's timeout period expiring.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Internal battleground cleanup
    code: "void Battleground::Update(uint32 diff) {\n    // ... other update logic\
      \ ...\n    _ProcessOfflineQueue();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use only and should not be called directly
    by external code. It operates on the battleground's internal player state and
    modifies game objects in-place. The method may be invoked multiple times per battleground
    update cycle depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Calling this method manually can lead to inconsistent game state or undefined
    behavior if not properly synchronized with the battleground's main update loop.
    It should only be used as part of the normal battleground lifecycle management.
