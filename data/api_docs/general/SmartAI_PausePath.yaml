  class: SmartAI
  method: PausePath
  signature: void SmartAI::PausePath(uint32 delay, bool forced)
documentation:
  brief: Pauses the current path movement for a specified delay duration in SmartAI.
  description: The PausePath method temporarily halts the creature's current path
    movement for a given delay period. This functionality is commonly used within
    SmartAI scripts to introduce timing delays between path segments or to synchronize
    movement with other AI events. When called, the creature will stop moving along
    its current path and remain stationary for the specified duration before resuming
    movement. The 'forced' parameter determines whether the pause overrides any existing
    movement states or respects them. This method is particularly useful in scripted
    encounters where precise timing of creature movements is required.
  parameters:
  - name: delay
    description: The delay in milliseconds to pause the path movement. Specifies how
      long the creature should remain stationary before resuming its path.
  - name: forced
    description: If true, forces the pause to occur regardless of current movement
      state. If false, the pause may be ignored if the creature is not currently moving
      or in a state that allows pausing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Pause
    code: "void OnCombatEnter(Unit* who)\n{\n    // Pause for 2 seconds before continuing\
      \ path\n    PausePath(2000, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Path Pause with Delay
    code: "void OnSpellHit(Unit* caster, SpellInfo const* spell)\n{\n    // Force\
      \ pause for 1.5 seconds regardless of movement state\n    PausePath(1500, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates within the context of SmartAI's event-driven system and
    should be called from within appropriate AI event handlers. The delay parameter
    is in milliseconds and affects only the current path execution. If a creature
    is currently not moving, calling PausePath with forced=false may have no effect.
  warnings: Using a large delay value can cause noticeable pauses in gameplay. Ensure
    that the delay values are reasonable for the intended game experience. Calling
    this method outside of proper AI event contexts might lead to undefined behavior
    or unexpected movement patterns.
