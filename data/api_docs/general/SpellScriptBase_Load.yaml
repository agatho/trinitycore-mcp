  class: SpellScriptBase
  method: Load
  signature: bool SpellScriptBase::Load()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads the spell script, returning true on success or false
    if loading fails.
  description: The Load method is responsible for initializing and setting up a spell
    script within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically called during
    the spell script's construction or activation phase to ensure all necessary resources
    are properly configured. It performs internal setup operations such as validating
    script parameters, registering callbacks, and preparing the script for execution.
    The method returns true if the initialization completes successfully, indicating
    that the spell script is ready to be used in combat or other game mechanics. If
    any critical errors occur during the loading process, such as missing required
    data or invalid configurations, the method returns false, signaling that the script
    cannot be properly initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the spell script was successfully loaded and initialized; false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates a failure in setup or configuration
    validation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Script Loading
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    bool Load() override\n\
      \    {\n        if (!SpellScript::Load())\n            return false;\n     \
      \   // Additional initialization code here\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore engine
    during spell script instantiation. Developers should ensure that any custom loading
    logic properly calls the base class Load() method to maintain proper initialization
    order.
  warnings: Calling Load() multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Always verify that the spell script has not already
    been loaded before calling this method.
