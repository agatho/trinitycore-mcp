  signature: void AreaTriggerMovementScript::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the area trigger movement script.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with an AreaTriggerMovementScript instance. This mask is typically used to track
    which properties or states of the area trigger have been modified since the last
    update. Clearing the mask ensures that subsequent checks will not report false
    positives for changed values, effectively resetting the change tracking state.
    This method is commonly invoked after processing changes or when synchronizing
    the script's state with the server's authoritative state.

    code: "class MyAreaTriggerScript : public AreaTriggerMovementScript\n{\npublic:\n\
      \    MyAreaTriggerScript() : AreaTriggerMovementScript(\"MyAreaTriggerScript\"\
      ) {}\n\n    void OnUpdate(AreaTrigger* trigger, uint32 diff) override\n    {\n\
      \        // Process changes...\n        ClearChangesMask(); // Reset the mask\
      \ after processing\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully to avoid losing track of actual changes
    if not properly synchronized with the game logic. It is recommended to call this
    method only after all relevant change processing has been completed.
