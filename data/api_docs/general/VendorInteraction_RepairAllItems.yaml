api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: RepairAllItems
  signature: InteractionResult VendorInteraction::RepairAllItems(Player * bot, Creature
    * vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Repairs all items in the player's inventory using the specified vendor.
  description: The RepairAllItems method processes all items currently equipped or
    in the player's inventory and repairs them using the provided vendor. It calculates
    the total repair cost based on item durability and the vendor's repair rates,
    then deducts the appropriate amount from the player's gold. The method ensures
    that only items eligible for repair are processed, such as those with less than
    full durability. This function is typically used in automated bot behavior or
    NPC interaction scripts to maintain character equipment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose items
      will be repaired.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor who will perform
      the repairs.
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum indicating success or failure of the
    repair operation. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS,
    or INVALID_VENDOR.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nInteractionResult result\
      \ = VendorInteraction::RepairAllItems(player, vendor);\nif (result == SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Items repaired successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nInteractionResult result\
      \ = VendorInteraction::RepairAllItems(player, vendor);\nswitch (result) {\n\
      \    case SUCCESS:\n        // All items repaired\n        break;\n    case\
      \ INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS:\n        // Notify player about insufficient gold\n  \
      \      break;\n    case FAILED:\n        // Log error or notify user\n     \
      \   break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the vendor is a valid repair vendor and that the player
    has sufficient funds. It does not check if the vendor actually supports repairs;
    this should be verified beforehand. The method may have performance implications
    when dealing with large inventories due to item-by-item processing.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and vendor pointers are valid before calling this
    function to avoid segmentation faults. Also, verify that the vendor is indeed
    a repair vendor to prevent unexpected behavior or errors during transaction processing.
