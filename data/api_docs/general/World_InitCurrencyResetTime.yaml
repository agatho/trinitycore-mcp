  brief: Initializes the currency reset time for all players in the world.
  description: The InitCurrencyResetTime method sets up the initial currency reset
    timing mechanism for the game world. This function is typically called during
    server startup or initialization to establish when player currency (such as honor
    points, arena points, or other tracked resources) will be reset. It ensures that
    all players' currency tracking systems are properly synchronized with the server's
    time management system. The method likely calculates and schedules the next reset
    time based on configured server settings and game rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  notes: This method is typically invoked during World::Initialize() or server startup
    sequence. It may involve database operations to fetch/reset currency data for
    all players and should be called before any currency-related operations begin.
