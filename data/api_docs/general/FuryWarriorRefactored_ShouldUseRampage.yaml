  class: FuryWarriorRefactored
  method: ShouldUseRampage
  signature: bool FuryWarriorRefactored::ShouldUseRampage() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Fury Warrior should use the Rampage ability based
    on current combat state and resource levels.
  description: This method evaluates the Fury Warrior's current situation to decide
    if using the Rampage ability is beneficial. It considers factors such as available
    rage, weapon damage, and combat conditions. The method typically returns true
    when the warrior has sufficient rage and the tactical advantage of using Rampage
    outweighs other potential actions. This decision-making process is crucial for
    optimal Fury Warrior gameplay in both PvE and PvP scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Fury Warrior should use Rampage, false otherwise. The
    decision is based on combat state, resource availability, and tactical positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (warrior->ShouldUseRampage()) {\n    // Execute Rampage ability\n  \
      \  warrior->UseRampage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::UpdateAI() {\n    if (ShouldUseRampage()) {\n\
      \        // Prioritize Rampage over other abilities\n        UseRampage();\n\
      \    } else if (HasSufficientRage()) {\n        // Use other rage-consuming\
      \ abilities\n        UseBloodthirst();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely incorporates game mechanics such as rage generation rates,
    weapon damage calculations, and cooldown management. Implementation may vary based
    on the specific combat phase or target type. This method is typically called within
    the warrior's AI decision-making loop to optimize ability usage.
  warnings: This method should not be used in isolation without considering other
    tactical factors. Incorrect implementation could lead to suboptimal resource management
    or missed opportunities for high-damage combinations. The return value may change
    rapidly during combat, so caching results might produce outdated decisions.
