  class: QuestStrategy
  method: GetCurrentObjective
  signature: int QuestStrategy::GetCurrentObjective(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current quest objective index for the specified bot AI.
  description: The GetCurrentObjective method returns the zero-based index of the
    currently active quest objective for a given bot AI instance. This index corresponds
    to the order in which objectives are defined within the quest's data structure.
    The method is typically used by quest strategy implementations to determine which
    objective the bot should be working towards next. It relies on the internal state
    tracking of the bot's current progress through the quest's objectives and may
    return -1 if no valid objective is currently active or if the quest state cannot
    be determined.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the index of the current quest objective, or -1
    if no objective is active or the quest state is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Strategy
    code: "int currentObjective = strategy.GetCurrentObjective(ai);\nif (currentObjective\
      \ >= 0) {\n    // Process the current objective\n    printf(\"Current objective\
      \ index: %d\\n\", currentObjective);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid state\n\
      \    printf(\"No active objective found.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI instance has a valid quest context and
    that the quest data is accessible. The returned index should be used to query
    specific objective details from the quest's objective list.
