  brief: Initializes all combat-related systems and subsystems for the Hunter AI.
  description: The InitializeCombatSystems method sets up and configures all necessary
    combat mechanics and behaviors for a hunter's AI. This includes initializing attack
    patterns, targeting systems, ability usage logic, and cooldown management specific
    to hunter class gameplay. The method ensures that the AI is properly prepared
    to engage in combat scenarios with appropriate tactical behavior. It typically
    gets called during AI initialization or when entering combat mode, establishing
    the foundation for all subsequent combat decisions and actions.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: "void MyHunterAI::OnInitialize()\n{\n    InitializeCombatSystems();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during AI setup. It's typically invoked
    automatically by the core AI framework when a hunter enters combat or is initialized.
    The initialization process may involve setting up internal state machines, registering
    combat callbacks, and preparing ability queues.
