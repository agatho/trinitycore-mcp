  signature: void Player::ApplyTraitEntryChanges(int32 editedConfigId, const WorldPackets::Traits::TraitConfig
    & newConfig, bool applyTraits, bool consumeCurrencies)
documentation:
  brief: Applies trait entry changes to a player's character configuration.
  description: This method updates the player's trait configurations based on the
    provided edited configuration ID and trait data. It handles both applying and
    consuming traits, allowing players to modify their character's trait points and
    currency usage within the game mechanics context. The method ensures proper synchronization
    of trait changes with the player's current state.
  parameters:
  - name: editedConfigId
    description: The configuration ID that identifies which trait configuration to
      modify. This typically corresponds to a specific trait tree or configuration
      in the game system.
  - name: newConfig
    description: The new trait configuration data that will be applied to the player's
      character. Contains detailed information about trait points and their distribution.
  - name: applyTraits
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply the traits or not. If true,
      the traits are applied; if false, they are removed or reset.
  - name: consumeCurrencies
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to consume currencies during trait
      application. This affects how many currency points are used in the process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trait Application Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      WorldPackets::Traits::TraitConfig traitConfig;

      traitConfig.TraitPoints = 10;

      traitConfig.TraitId = 123;

      player->ApplyTraitEntryChanges(1, traitConfig, true, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires careful handling of player state and should be called
    only when the player is in a valid state for trait modifications. Implementation
    involves synchronization with existing trait systems.
  warnings: Improper usage can lead to incorrect trait points or currency consumption,
    potentially causing game balance issues. Ensure that all parameters are properly
    validated before calling this method.
