documentation:
  brief: Processes pending guild-related events and updates guild state accordingly.
  description: The ProcessGuildEvents method handles all queued guild events such
    as member joins, leaves, promotions, demotions, and other guild activities. It
    iterates through the internal event queue, applies necessary changes to guild
    data structures, and ensures synchronization with the game world state. This method
    is typically called during the game loop to maintain up-to-date guild information
    and trigger appropriate notifications or actions based on guild events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n    guildIntegration->ProcessGuildEvents();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to ensure timely
    processing of guild events. It may block briefly during event processing, so frequent
    calls could impact performance if many events are queued.
