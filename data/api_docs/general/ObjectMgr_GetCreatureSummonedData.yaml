documentation:
  brief: Retrieves summoned creature data for a given entry ID
  description: The GetCreatureSummonedData method retrieves a const int array containing
    summoned creature data associated with the specified entry ID. This method is
    typically used to access predefined summoning parameters or configurations for
    creatures within the TrinityCore framework. The returned pointer points to an
    internal data structure that should not be modified by callers. The method assumes
    that the entryId corresponds to a valid creature template in the database and
    will return nullptr if no data is found for the given ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int pointer to an array of summoned creature data values, or nullptr
    if no data exists for the specified entry ID. The array typically contains configuration
    parameters such as summon duration, summon type, or other creature-specific summoning
    properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const int* summonData = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureSummonedData(12345);\nif\
      \ (summonData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use summonData[0], summonData[1], etc.\n\
      \    uint32 duration = summonData[0];\n    uint32 type = summonData[1];\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that are populated during server
    startup from database entries. The returned array is not dynamically allocated
    and should be treated as read-only. Performance considerations include potential
    database lookups if the data isn't cached in memory.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be nullptr, so always check for null before dereferencing.
    Do not modify the contents of the returned array as it's part of internal data
    structures.
