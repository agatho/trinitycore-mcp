  class: MovementValidator
  method: SetStuckParameters
  signature: void MovementValidator::SetStuckParameters(float threshold, uint32 checkInterval,
    uint32 maxCounter)
documentation:
  brief: Configures the stuck detection parameters for movement validation.
  description: The SetStuckParameters method initializes or updates the threshold,
    check interval, and maximum counter values used by the MovementValidator to determine
    if a unit is stuck during movement. This method allows fine-tuning of the stuck
    detection algorithm which is crucial for maintaining smooth gameplay and preventing
    units from becoming permanently blocked in invalid positions. The parameters control
    how aggressively the system detects stuck states and how frequently checks are
    performed.
  parameters:
  - name: threshold
    description: The distance threshold (in yards) that determines when a unit is
      considered stuck. If movement progress is less than this value over multiple
      checks, the unit may be flagged as stuck.
  - name: checkInterval
    description: The time interval (in milliseconds) between consecutive stuck detection
      checks. Lower values increase sensitivity but may impact performance.
  - name: maxCounter
    description: The maximum number of consecutive failed movement attempts before
      a unit is considered permanently stuck and triggers appropriate actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MovementValidator validator;

      validator.SetStuckParameters(0.5f, 1000, 3);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Configuration
    code: 'MovementValidator validator;

      // Configure for sensitive detection with frequent checks

      validator.SetStuckParameters(0.2f, 500, 5);

      // Or configure for less sensitive detection with infrequent checks

      validator.SetStuckParameters(1.0f, 2000, 2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization or configuration of
    movement validation systems. The parameters directly influence the behavior of
    the stuck detection algorithm and should be tuned based on game mechanics and
    performance requirements. Changes to these parameters will affect how units are
    handled when they become stuck in terrain or other obstacles.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values can lead to false positives (marking units
    as stuck when they're not) or false negatives (failing to detect actual stuck
    states). Setting the threshold too low may cause unnecessary intervention, while
    setting it too high might allow units to remain stuck for extended periods. The
    check interval should be balanced between responsiveness and performance impact.
