api:
  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetTimestamp
  signature: uint32 MovementRequest::GetTimestamp() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the timestamp associated with this movement request.
  description: The GetTimestamp method returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing
    the time at which this movement request was created or processed. In the context
    of TrinityCore's movement system, this timestamp is typically used for synchronization
    purposes, ensuring that movement updates are handled in the correct order and
    that outdated requests are properly managed. The value usually corresponds to
    a game tick or internal time counter that helps maintain consistency across client-server
    communication.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the timestamp when this movement request was
    generated or processed. This value typically reflects an internal game time reference
    used for ordering and synchronization of movement data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      uint32 timestamp = request.GetTimestamp();

      // Use timestamp for logging or comparison purposes'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Movement Request Timestamps
    code: "MovementRequest req1, req2;\nuint32 ts1 = req1.GetTimestamp();\nuint32\
      \ ts2 = req2.GetTimestamp();\nif (ts1 > ts2)\n{\n    // Handle older movement\
      \ request\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other movement-related APIs
    to ensure proper ordering and handling of player or object movements. The timestamp
    value should be treated as an opaque identifier for ordering purposes rather than
    a human-readable time.
