documentation:
  brief: Manages the Fistweaving ability for a Monk AI, handling the logic for applying
    and maintaining the Fistweaving buff.
  description: The ManageFistweaving method is responsible for controlling the Fistweaving
    mechanic within the Monk AI system. This method ensures that the appropriate Fistweaving
    effects are applied to the monk's attacks based on game rules and combat state.
    It typically handles the logic for when to activate Fistweaving, how long it should
    last, and which attacks should benefit from the buff. The method is part of the
    core AI behavior for Monk characters in TrinityCore, ensuring proper adherence
    to class-specific abilities and gameplay mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManageFistweaving();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked regularly to maintain proper Fistweaving state. The implementation likely
    checks for valid combat conditions, player stance, and available resources before
    applying or updating the Fistweaving buff.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when the AI unit is in a valid
    combat state to prevent incorrect buff application. Improper usage may lead to
    unexpected behavior in Monk class abilities.
