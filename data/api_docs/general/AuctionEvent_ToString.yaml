  brief: Converts an AuctionEvent object into a human-readable string representation.
  description: The ToString method provides a textual summary of the AuctionEvent
    object's current state. This method is typically used for debugging, logging,
    or displaying auction-related information in a readable format. It concatenates
    relevant properties of the auction event such as item ID, auction house ID, bid
    amount, and time-related data into a single string. The output format is designed
    to be consistent and informative for developers and administrators monitoring
    auction activities within the TrinityCore server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the AuctionEvent
    object's properties, including key identifiers and timing information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debugging
    code: 'AuctionEvent event;

      // Assume event is populated with data

      std::string eventString = event.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("auction", "Auction Event: {}", eventString);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any I/O operations or database queries. It only
    formats existing internal data members into a string. The exact format of the
    returned string may vary depending on implementation details and could change
    between TrinityCore versions.
