documentation:
  brief: SendExplorationExperience sends exploration experience to the player for
    a specific area.
  description: This method is used to send exploration experience to a player when
    they discover a new area or complete exploration objectives. It typically occurs
    during quest completion or when a player discovers new zones. The method handles
    sending the appropriate experience gain based on the area and experience parameters
    provided. This function is part of the player's communication system and ensures
    proper game progression for exploration mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: Area
    description: The area ID that the player has explored, typically corresponding
      to a zone or instance where exploration was completed.
  - name: Experience
    description: The amount of experience gained from exploration, which is usually
      calculated based on the area's difficulty and player's level.

      player->SendExplorationExperience(1234, 5678);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when exploration
    progress occurs. It may be used in conjunction with other player methods like
    AddItem or UpdatePlayerQuest. The method requires proper handling of experience
    gain and should not be called directly without proper context.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect experience calculation,
    potentially causing players to receive too much or too little experience. Ensure
    that the area ID and experience values are valid before calling this method.
