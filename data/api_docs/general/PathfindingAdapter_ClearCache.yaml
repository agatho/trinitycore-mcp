  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: ClearCache
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::ClearCache(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the pathfinding cache for a specified player bot
  description: The ClearCache method invalidates and removes all cached pathfinding
    data associated with a given player bot. This is typically used when the bot's
    environment or position has changed significantly, ensuring that subsequent pathfinding
    operations will recalculate paths from scratch rather than using potentially outdated
    cached results. The method operates on the internal cache structure maintained
    by the PathfindingAdapter class to optimize performance during frequent path calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose pathfinding
      cache should be cleared. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear cache for a specific bot
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot

      PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      adapter.ClearCache(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a bot's position changes dramatically
    or when the environment around the bot has been modified in a way that would invalidate
    existing cached paths. It helps maintain pathfinding accuracy but may cause temporary
    performance overhead as new paths are recalculated.
