documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an item from the player's buyback slot by specified slot index.
  description: This method fetches an item from the player's buyback inventory slot,
    which is used to store items that have been sold back to vendors. The buyback
    system allows players to retrieve items they previously sold, typically within
    a short time frame after selling them. This method returns a pointer to the Item
    object at the specified slot index, or nullptr if no item exists at that position.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with the player's buyback inventory management
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Item object located in the specified buyback slot,
    or nullptr if the slot is empty or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemFromBuyBackSlot(0);\nif (item)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ the retrieved item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's buyback inventory system and should be
    used carefully as it may involve accessing memory that has been freed. The slot
    index must be valid (0-12) to avoid undefined behavior.
