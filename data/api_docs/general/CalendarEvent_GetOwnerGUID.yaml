  class: CalendarEvent
  method: GetOwnerGUID
  signature: int CalendarEvent::GetOwnerGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the calendar event owner.
  description: The GetOwnerGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier of
    the player who owns or created the calendar event. This GUID is used internally
    by TrinityCore to track ownership and permissions for calendar events. The returned
    value represents the database entry identifier for the owning player character,
    which can be used to retrieve additional information about the owner through other
    API methods or database queries. This method does not perform any validation on
    the owner's existence or online status.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the calendar event owner. This value
    corresponds to the player's unique identifier in the database, typically used
    for linking to player records and verifying ownership permissions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    int ownerGUID = event->GetOwnerGUID();\n    printf(\"Event owner GUID:\
      \ %d\\n\", ownerGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID is typically the same as the player's AccountId or CharacterId
    in the database. This method is commonly used when checking permissions for calendar
    event modifications or when displaying event ownership information to players.
