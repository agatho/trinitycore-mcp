  method: SyncWithLoadTester
  signature: void BotProfiler::SyncWithLoadTester()
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes the bot profiler's internal state with the load tester's current
    configuration and performance metrics.
  description: The SyncWithLoadTester method ensures that the BotProfiler class maintains
    consistent and up-to-date information regarding the current load testing environment.
    This synchronization is crucial for accurate profiling of bot behavior under various
    stress conditions. The method likely updates internal counters, timing data, or
    performance thresholds based on the active load tester configuration. It should
    be called periodically during load testing sessions to maintain data integrity
    between the profiler and tester components.

  - title: Basic synchronization call
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SyncWithLoadTester();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked automatically by the load testing framework
    during test execution, but may also be called manually when external configuration
    changes occur. It's important to ensure that no profiling operations are in progress
    when calling this method to avoid race conditions.
