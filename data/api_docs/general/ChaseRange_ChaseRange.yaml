  class: ChaseRange
  method: ChaseRange
  signature: void ChaseRange::ChaseRange(float _minRange, float _minTolerance, float
    _maxTolerance, float _maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the chase range parameters for an AI-controlled unit's movement
    behavior.
  description: The ChaseRange constructor method configures the minimum and maximum
    range thresholds used by the AI to determine when to pursue or maintain distance
    from a target. This method sets up the tolerance values that define how closely
    the AI will follow its target within the specified range boundaries. The parameters
    control the AI's behavior during chase mechanics, ensuring realistic movement
    patterns based on combat distance requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: _minRange
    description: The minimum acceptable distance (in yards) from the target before
      the AI begins to move closer. Must be non-negative.
  - name: _minTolerance
    description: The tolerance margin around _minRange where the AI will not adjust
      its position. Must be non-negative and less than or equal to _maxRange - _minRange.
  - name: _maxTolerance
    description: The tolerance margin around _maxRange where the AI will not adjust
      its position. Must be non-negative and less than or equal to _maxRange - _minRange.
  - name: _maxRange
    description: The maximum acceptable distance (in yards) from the target before
      the AI begins to move away. Must be greater than or equal to _minRange.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chase Range Setup
    code: 'ChaseRange range(2.0f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 8.0f);

      // Sets up a chase behavior with min range of 2 yards, max range of 8 yards

      // with 0.5 yard tolerance on both ends'
    language: cpp
  - title: Precise Chase Range Configuration
    code: "Unit* target = unit->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    float distance =\
      \ unit->GetDistance(target);\n    if (distance < 3.0f)\n        range.ChaseRange(1.5f,\
      \ 0.2f, 0.2f, 5.0f);\n    else\n        range.ChaseRange(2.0f, 0.3f, 0.3f, 8.0f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI movement scripts to define how closely
    a creature will follow its target during combat. The tolerance values help prevent
    oscillating behavior when the unit is near range boundaries. This configuration
    directly affects the unit's pathfinding and positioning decisions.
  warnings: Setting _minRange greater than _maxRange will result in undefined behavior.
    Tolerance values should be chosen carefully to avoid excessive movement jittering
    or stuck behavior at range boundaries.
