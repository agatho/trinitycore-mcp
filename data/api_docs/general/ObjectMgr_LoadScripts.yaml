  class: ObjectMgr
  method: LoadScripts
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadScripts(ScriptsType type)
documentation:
  brief: Loads script data for the specified scripts type into the object manager.
  description: The LoadScripts method initializes and loads script data for a given
    ScriptsType into the ObjectMgr. This method is typically invoked during server
    startup or when reloading scripts to ensure that all scripted game objects, creatures,
    game objects, and other entities are properly registered with the core system.
    It handles parsing and storing of script definitions from database tables or configuration
    files, making them available for execution during gameplay events such as creature
    AI triggers, quest completions, or game object interactions. The method ensures
    that scripts are correctly linked to their respective game entities and are ready
    to be executed by the scripting engine.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: Specifies the type of scripts to load. This parameter determines
      which database tables or script sources will be processed. Valid values typically
      include types like CREATURE_SCRIPTS, GAMEOBJECT_SCRIPTS, QUEST_SCRIPTS, and
      others depending on the TrinityCore implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Load all creature scripts
    code: ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadScripts(SC_CREATURE);
    language: cpp
  - title: Load all game object scripts
    code: ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadScripts(SC_GAMEOBJECT);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server initialization or when reloading
    scripts dynamically. It is not thread-safe and must be executed in a single-threaded
    context to prevent race conditions. The method relies on database connections
    being established before it's invoked.
  warnings: Calling LoadScripts with an invalid ScriptsType may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the database tables for the specified script
    type contain valid data before invoking this method. Avoid calling this during
    active gameplay to prevent potential synchronization issues.
