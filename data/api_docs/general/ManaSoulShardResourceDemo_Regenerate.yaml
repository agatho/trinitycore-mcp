  method: Regenerate
  signature: void ManaSoulShardResourceDemo::Regenerate(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Regenerates mana soul shards over time based on the specified time difference.
  description: The Regenerate method updates the internal state of mana soul shards
    by applying regeneration logic based on the elapsed time difference passed as
    a parameter. This method is typically called during game loop updates to simulate
    gradual restoration of mana soul shards, which are a resource used in certain
    class abilities or mechanics within TrinityCore. The regeneration process may
    be influenced by factors such as player class, equipped items, buffs, or other
    game mechanics that affect resource recovery rates.

  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'uint32 diff = 1000; // 1 second elapsed

      manaSoulShardResourceDemo->Regenerate(diff);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked regularly in the game loop, typically every
    tick or at fixed intervals, to ensure smooth resource regeneration. It is important
    that the 'diff' parameter accurately reflects the time passed since last invocation
    for realistic behavior.
