  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SetTimeToTarget
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetTimeToTarget(uint32 timeToTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the time it takes for the area trigger to reach its target position.
  description: The SetTimeToTarget method configures the duration over which an area
    trigger will move from its initial position to its final target position. This
    is commonly used in spell effects or game mechanics where smooth movement of area
    triggers is required, such as in AoE spells or environmental effects. The time
    value is specified in milliseconds and determines how long the interpolation process
    takes. This method directly influences the animation and timing of area trigger
    movement in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: timeToTarget
    description: The duration in milliseconds for the area trigger to reach its target
      position. Valid values are positive integers representing time intervals.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Area Trigger Movement Time
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    trigger->SetTimeToTarget(2000); // Set movement time to 2 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Time Adjustment Based on Spell Power
    code: "uint32 spellPower = player->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_MOD_DAMAGE_DONE_POS);\n\
      AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n   \
      \ uint32 time = 1000 + (spellPower / 10); // Base 1 second, plus additional\
      \ time based on spell power\n    trigger->SetTimeToTarget(time);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the interpolation timing of area triggers and should
    be called before initiating movement. The actual movement behavior depends on
    the area trigger's type and configuration. This method does not validate whether
    the time value is within reasonable bounds, so developers should ensure appropriate
    values are passed.
  warnings: Calling this method after an area trigger has already started moving may
    result in unpredictable behavior or visual glitches. Ensure that the timeToTarget
    parameter is a positive integer to avoid unexpected movement artifacts.
