documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the internal ID associated with a given client identifier
    for player choices.
  description: The FindIdByClientIdentifier method retrieves the internal database
    ID corresponding to a provided client-side identifier used in player choice systems.
    This is typically utilized when processing player interactions with choice windows
    or dialog options within the game. The method performs a lookup operation based
    on the clientIdentifier parameter and returns the associated internal ID if found,
    otherwise returning -1 to indicate no match. It's commonly used during quest progression,
    NPC interactions, or other scenarios where client-side choice identifiers need
    to be resolved to server-side data entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the internal database ID associated with
    the given client identifier. If no matching entry is found, it returns -1.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int choiceId = playerChoiceData->FindIdByClientIdentifier(1234);\nif (choiceId\
      \ != -1)\n{\n    // Process the valid choice ID\n    printf(\"Found choice ID:\
      \ %d\\n\", choiceId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid or unknown client identifier\n\
      \    printf(\"No matching choice found for identifier 1234\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup in an internal map or database structure.
    It's important to note that the clientIdentifier parameter should be validated
    before calling this method, as invalid identifiers may cause performance issues
    or unexpected behavior. The method is marked as const, indicating it does not
    modify any member variables.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized clientIdentifier
    may result in incorrect lookups or undefined behavior. Always validate the input
    identifier before use and handle the -1 return value appropriately to avoid processing
    invalid data.
