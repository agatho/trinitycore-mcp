  class: InterruptDatabase
  method: GetSpellsByCategory
  signature: int InterruptDatabase::GetSpellsByCategory(SpellCategory category)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of spells associated with a specified spell category
    from the interrupt database.
  description: The GetSpellsByCategory method queries the InterruptDatabase to determine
    how many spells are registered under a given SpellCategory. This is typically
    used during spell processing or interrupt handling logic within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method does not return the actual spell IDs, but rather provides
    a count of how many spells belong to that category. It's commonly invoked when
    evaluating whether an interrupt should be triggered based on category-based rules.
    The method assumes the SpellCategory parameter is valid and corresponds to an
    existing category in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of spells found in the specified
    SpellCategory. Returns zero if no spells are found or if the category is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Count Spells in a Category
    code: "SpellCategory category = SPELL_CATEGORY_INTERRUPT;\nint spellCount = interruptDatabase.GetSpellsByCategory(category);\n\
      if (spellCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with interrupt logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Found %d spells in interrupt category.\", spellCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a database query or accesses an internal lookup
    table. It's recommended to cache results if the same category is queried repeatedly
    to avoid redundant lookups. The method may be thread-safe depending on how the
    underlying database is implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that the SpellCategory value passed to this method is valid; passing
    an invalid or uninitialized category could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect
    counts. This method should not be used for retrieving actual spell data, only
    for counting purposes.
