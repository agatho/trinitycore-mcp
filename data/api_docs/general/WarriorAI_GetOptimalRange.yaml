  class: WarriorAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float WarriorAI::GetOptimalRange(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the warrior AI based
    on target unit.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    warrior AI unit should engage its target for maximum effectiveness. This calculation
    takes into account the warrior's weapon range, combat abilities, and the target's
    movement characteristics. The returned float value represents the distance in
    yards. This method is typically used by the AI to decide when to close to melee
    range or maintain a safe distance during combat. It considers factors such as
    the warrior's current stance, equipped weapons, and any special abilities that
    might affect optimal engagement distance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal attack range in yards. This value
    indicates the distance at which the AI should position itself relative to its
    target for effective combat. The value is typically between 0.0f and the maximum
    weapon range of the warrior's equipped weapon, with special cases for abilities
    that extend reach.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat decision making
    code: "float optimalRange = ai->GetOptimalRange(targetUnit);\nif (ai->GetDistanceTo(targetUnit)\
      \ > optimalRange)\n{\n    ai->MoveTowards(targetUnit, optimalRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using optimal range to determine attack timing
    code: "float range = ai->GetOptimalRange(target);\nfloat distance = ai->GetDistanceTo(target);\n\
      if (distance <= range && ai->CanAttack(target))\n{\n    ai->Attack(target);\n\
      }\nelse if (distance > range)\n{\n    ai->MoveTowards(target, range);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WarriorAI class and relies on internal state tracking
    of the warrior's current weapon, stance, and abilities. The returned value may
    vary dynamically based on combat conditions and the AI's current tactical situation.
    This method should be called frequently during combat to ensure optimal positioning
    decisions.
  warnings: The method assumes that the AI unit has a valid target set. Calling this
    method without a proper target may result in undefined behavior or incorrect range
    calculations. Additionally, the returned value is only meaningful when used within
    the context of active combat where the warrior's weapon and stance are properly
    configured.
