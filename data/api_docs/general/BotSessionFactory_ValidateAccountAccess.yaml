  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: ValidateAccountAccess
  signature: bool BotSessionFactory::ValidateAccountAccess(uint32 accountId) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given account has access to bot functionality in the
    TrinityCore server.
  description: The ValidateAccountAccess method checks if a specified account ID is
    permitted to use bot features within the TrinityCore framework. This validation
    typically involves checking account permissions, security levels, or specific
    flags that control access to automated player characters (bots). The method ensures
    that only authorized accounts can create or manage bots, maintaining server integrity
    and preventing abuse. It's commonly used during bot creation processes or when
    accessing bot-related commands to confirm account eligibility.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified account has valid access permissions for
    bot functionality; otherwise returns false if the account lacks proper authorization
    or is restricted from using bots.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Account Access Validation
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nif (sessionFactory->ValidateAccountAccess(accountId))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with bot creation or management\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"\
      Account {} has access to bot functionality.\", accountId);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Deny access to bot features\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Account {} does not\
      \ have access to bot functionality.\", accountId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups or checks cached account data
    for permissions. It should be called before any bot-related operations to prevent
    unauthorized access. The implementation may vary depending on how TrinityCore
    defines account permissions and bot access control.
  warnings: Ensure that account IDs passed to this method are validated and sanitized
    to prevent potential security issues. This method does not perform authentication
    itself but relies on the validity of the provided account ID.
