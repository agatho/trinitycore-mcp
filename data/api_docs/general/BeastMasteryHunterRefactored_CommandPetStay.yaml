documentation:
  brief: Commands the hunter's pet to stop moving and remain in place.
  description: The CommandPetStay method instructs the hunter's current pet to cease
    all movement and remain stationary at its present location. This command is typically
    issued when the hunter wants their pet to hold position during combat or while
    performing other actions. The method affects the pet's AI behavior, causing it
    to enter a 'stay' state where it will not pursue targets or move unless explicitly
    commanded otherwise. This functionality is core to the Beast Mastery hunter's
    control over their pet and is used in various tactical scenarios.

  - title: Basic Pet Stay Command
    code: 'BeastMasteryHunterRefactored* hunter = ...;

      hunter->CommandPetStay();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's AI state machine to set a 'stay'
    flag or state. It may also send network updates to clients to synchronize the
    pet's behavior across all players in the area.
