  class: DamageInfo
  method: BlockDamage
  signature: void DamageInfo::BlockDamage(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the blocked damage amount for this damage info instance.
  description: The BlockDamage method is used to assign a specific amount of damage
    that has been blocked by the target. This method typically updates internal state
    within the DamageInfo class to reflect that a portion of incoming damage was mitigated
    through blocking mechanisms such as shields, defensive abilities, or armor. The
    blocked damage value is usually set during combat calculations when a successful
    block occurs. This method does not directly modify the actual damage dealt but
    rather tracks how much damage was prevented from being applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of BlockDamage
    code: 'DamageInfo* damageInfo = new DamageInfo();

      damageInfo->BlockDamage(50); // Sets 50 as the blocked damage amount'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Blocked Damage in Combat Context
    code: "void OnPlayerBlock(Unit* attacker, Unit* victim) {\n    uint32 blockedAmount\
      \ = 25;\n    DamageInfo* dmgInfo = victim->GetDamageInfo();\n    if (dmgInfo)\
      \ {\n        dmgInfo->BlockDamage(blockedAmount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during combat processing when
    a block event occurs. It's important to note that blocked damage does not reduce
    the total damage dealt, but instead modifies how much damage is actually applied
    to the target's health. The method should be used in conjunction with other damage-related
    methods to properly track combat outcomes.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called after verifying that a block has
    occurred, as setting blocked damage without actual blocking can lead to incorrect
    combat calculations. This method modifies internal state and should not be used
    outside of appropriate combat contexts.
