  class: EscortAI
  method: AddWaypoint
  signature: void EscortAI::AddWaypoint(int id, float x, float y, float z, float orientation,
    int waitTime, bool run)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new waypoint to the EscortAI's path with specified coordinates and
    behavior settings.
  description: The AddWaypoint method is used to define a specific location in 3D
    space that an NPC controlled by EscortAI will move towards during escort quests.
    Each waypoint defines a destination point including position (x, y, z), orientation,
    wait time at the waypoint, and movement speed (run). Waypoints are added sequentially
    to form a path that the NPC follows. The method is typically used during quest
    initialization or when setting up an escort mission. The EscortAI will automatically
    navigate between waypoints using standard movement mechanics, pausing for the
    specified wait time if provided.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for this waypoint. Used to reference and manage
      waypoints in the escort path. Must be a positive integer.
  - name: x
    description: X coordinate of the waypoint position in the game world.
  - name: y
    description: Y coordinate of the waypoint position in the game world.
  - name: z
    description: Z coordinate of the waypoint position in the game world (height).
  - name: orientation
    description: Facing direction of the NPC at this waypoint, specified in radians.
      Zero points east.
  - name: waitTime
    description: Time in milliseconds to pause at this waypoint before continuing
      to the next one. Set to 0 for no wait.
  - name: run
    description: If true, NPC will run; if false, NPC will walk. Controls movement
      speed during travel between waypoints.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Waypoint Addition
    code: "void AddBasicWaypoints()\n{\n    EscortAI* escort = new EscortAI();\n \
      \   escort->AddWaypoint(1, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f, 0, true);\n    escort->AddWaypoint(2,\
      \ 150.0f, 250.0f, 300.0f, 1.57f, 2000, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Waypoint with Wait Time
    code: "void AddWaitWaypoints()\n{\n    EscortAI* escort = new EscortAI();\n  \
      \  escort->AddWaypoint(1, 50.0f, 50.0f, 10.0f, 0.0f, 0, true);\n    escort->AddWaypoint(2,\
      \ 50.0f, 100.0f, 10.0f, 0.0f, 3000, false); // Wait 3 seconds\n    escort->AddWaypoint(3,\
      \ 100.0f, 100.0f, 10.0f, 3.14f, 0, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Waypoints are stored in a sequential list and processed in order. The EscortAI
    will not proceed to the next waypoint until it reaches the current one. This method
    should be called before starting the escort sequence. Waypoint IDs must be unique
    within an escort path to avoid conflicts.
  warnings: Adding waypoints after the escort has started may cause unpredictable
    behavior or path corruption. Ensure that all coordinates are valid and reachable
    by the NPC's movement type. Using very large wait times can make quests feel unresponsive
    to players.
