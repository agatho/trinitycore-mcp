documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff effects on the restoration shaman character.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buff effects applied to a restoration shaman character within the TrinityCore
    framework. This includes handling periodic healing buffs, stat enhancements, and
    other temporary beneficial effects that are part of the shaman's gameplay mechanics.
    The method typically iterates through the character's active buff list, updates
    their durations, applies any necessary modifications, and ensures that the visual
    and functional aspects of each buff remain synchronized with the game state. This
    method is commonly invoked during tick intervals or when specific conditions are
    met to maintain proper gameplay balance and character performance.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    RestorationShamanRefactored* shaman = GetPlayerShaman();\n\
      \    shaman->UpdateBuffs();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Buff Management System
    code: "class ShamanBuffManager\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAllShamanBuffs()\n\
      \    {\n        for (auto& shaman : GetRestorationShamans())\n        {\n  \
      \          shaman->UpdateBuffs();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain proper
    buff state synchronization. The implementation may involve checking for expired
    buffs, applying periodic effects, and updating visual indicators. Performance
    considerations include avoiding excessive iterations over large buff lists.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate game tick contexts may lead
    to inconsistent buff states or visual glitches. Ensure that all buff modifications
    are thread-safe if called from concurrent execution paths.
