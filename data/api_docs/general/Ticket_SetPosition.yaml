  class: Ticket
  method: SetPosition
  signature: void Ticket::SetPosition(int mapId, const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the position of the ticket including map ID and coordinates.
  description: The SetPosition method updates the location data associated with a
    ticket, storing both the map identifier and positional coordinates. This method
    is typically used within the ticketing system to track where in the game world
    a ticket was created or is relevant. The map ID identifies the specific zone or
    instance, while the position parameter likely contains x, y, z coordinates or
    a packed coordinate value depending on internal implementation. This method does
    not validate the provided values against actual game boundaries or map constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the game map where the ticket is located.
      Valid values correspond to valid map IDs in the TrinityCore database.
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the position data for the ticket.
      The exact format depends on internal implementation but typically encodes x,
      y, z coordinates or a packed coordinate value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Ticket Position
    code: 'Ticket* ticket = new Ticket();

      int mapId = 1234;

      int position = 56789;

      ticket->SetPosition(mapId, position);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method takes a reference to an integer for the position parameter, which
    suggests that the internal storage might be optimized for memory or performance
    reasons. The actual coordinate format (packed vs separate values) should be determined
    by inspecting related methods or documentation.
  warnings: This method does not perform validation of mapId or position values. Providing
    invalid map IDs or malformed position data may lead to unexpected behavior in
    the ticketing system or related game mechanics.
