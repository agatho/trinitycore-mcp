documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's seer status to indicate whether they are in a seer state.
  description: The SetSeer method is used to configure a player's seer status within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method typically controls whether a player is
    considered a 'seer' in terms of game mechanics, such as being able to see certain
    visual effects or having access to specific abilities. The method takes an integer
    pointer as input which likely represents the target state or status of the seer.
    It's important to note that this method may be part of a larger system related
    to player state management and could affect gameplay elements like vision, interaction,
    or special abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the seer status value. This
      parameter likely controls whether the player is in a seer state, with values
      typically indicating different states such as 'active', 'inactive', or 'disabled'.
      The exact meaning depends on how the method is implemented within the framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int seerStatus = 1;

      player->SetSeer(&seerStatus);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int seerStatus = 0;

      player->SetSeer(&seerStatus);

      // This could be used to disable seer status for gameplay mechanics

      // such as disabling visual effects or special abilities'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may involve internal state management within the player object,
    and should be used carefully as it might affect game balance or player interaction.
    Implementation details may vary depending on how the seer status is defined in
    the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: This method could potentially affect player behavior or game mechanics
    if not handled properly. Care should be taken to ensure that the seer status values
    are correctly interpreted and applied, especially when dealing with visual effects
    or abilities related to seer state.
