  class: TargetSelector
  method: TargetSelector
  signature: void TargetSelector::TargetSelector(Player * bot, BotThreatManager *
    threatManager)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a TargetSelector instance with the specified bot player and threat
    manager.
  description: The TargetSelector constructor initializes a target selection mechanism
    for a bot player within the TrinityCore framework. It sets up internal references
    to both the player bot and its associated threat manager, which are essential
    for determining appropriate combat targets based on threat levels and other factors.
    This initialization is crucial for proper AI behavior in player versus environment
    (PvE) scenarios where bots must make intelligent decisions about which enemies
    to attack. The method does not perform any target selection itself but prepares
    the object for subsequent target evaluation operations.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will use this
      target selector. Must be a valid player instance with proper initialization.
  - name: threatManager
    description: Pointer to the BotThreatManager associated with the bot. This manager
      tracks threat levels from various targets and is used by the target selector
      to make informed decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic TargetSelector Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player instance

      BotThreatManager* threatMgr = ...; // Threat manager instance

      TargetSelector selector(myBot, threatMgr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called after both the bot player and threat
    manager have been properly initialized. The TargetSelector does not take ownership
    of the provided pointers, so they must remain valid throughout the lifetime of
    the selector object.
  warnings: Passing null pointers to this constructor will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes during target selection operations. Always validate that both
    parameters are non-null before calling this constructor.
