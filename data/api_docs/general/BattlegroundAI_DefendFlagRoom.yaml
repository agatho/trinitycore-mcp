  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: DefendFlagRoom
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::DefendFlagRoom(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the battleground AI should defend the flag room during
    capture.
  description: The DefendFlagRoom method evaluates if the battleground AI should prioritize
    defending the flag room, typically used in capture the flag style battlegrounds
    like Eye of the Storm or Alterac Valley. It checks various conditions such as
    player count, flag status, and strategic positioning to decide whether defensive
    actions should be taken. This method is part of the core battleground AI logic
    that governs NPC behavior during flag-based objectives.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should defend the flag room, false otherwise. The
    decision is based on internal game state checks including player presence, flag
    capture status, and strategic importance of the flag room location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground AI logic
    code: "if (bgAI->DefendFlagRoom()) {\n    // Execute defensive actions\n    bgAI->SetState(BG_STATE_DEFEND);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground AI update cycles. It's
    important to note that the actual implementation details may vary between different
    battleground types, as this method is likely overridden in specific battleground
    implementations. The method should be used within the context of a valid battleground
    instance.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of a proper battleground context as it
    relies on internal battleground state variables. Incorrect usage may lead to undefined
    behavior or AI inconsistencies during gameplay.
