documentation:
  brief: Casts the Wing Buffet spell on the current target.
  description: The CastWingBuffet method is responsible for executing the Wing Buffet
    ability specific to Evoker class AI behavior. This method typically handles the
    logic for selecting a target, checking if the spell can be cast, and then initiating
    the spell casting process. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method
    would be invoked during an evoker's AI update cycle or in response to specific
    combat conditions. The method does not return any value as it performs an action
    directly on the creature's current target.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \     return;\n\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n        return;\n\
      \n    // Cast Wing Buffet when appropriate\n    CastWingBuffet();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EvokerAI class which implements specialized behavior
    for evoker creatures in TrinityCore. The implementation likely includes checks
    for spell cooldowns, line-of-sight, and target validity before casting. It's expected
    to be called from within the AI update loop or other combat-related functions.
