  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandleRiptide
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleRiptide(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to cast Riptide spell on a target unit.
  description: The HandleRiptide method is responsible for managing the casting logic
    of the Riptide spell within the Shaman AI system. This method evaluates whether
    the current target is valid for casting Riptide, checks if the spell is available
    (including cooldowns and resource requirements), and executes the spell cast if
    all conditions are met. The method typically operates as part of the AI's decision-making
    process during combat, prioritizing healing spells based on the Shaman's current
    situation and target health status. It returns true upon successful initiation
    of the spell cast or when no action is needed, and false if the spell cannot be
    cast due to invalid targets, cooldowns, or insufficient resources.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      The method uses this value to determine which unit to cast Riptide on.
  returns: Returns true if the spell was successfully initiated or no action was required,
    false if the spell could not be cast due to invalid conditions such as unavailable
    target, cooldowns, or insufficient mana.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Shaman AI context
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandleRiptide(&targetId)) {\n    // Spell cast initiated\
      \ successfully\n    // Additional logic can be added here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with target selection logic
    code: "Unit* target = SelectBestHealTarget();\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n    int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    if (shamanAI->HandleRiptide(&targetId))\
      \ {\n        // Riptide successfully cast on the selected target\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Shaman AI's healing priority system and should
    be called within appropriate combat or healing decision-making loops. The target
    parameter must point to a valid unit ID; otherwise, the method may fail silently
    or return false without casting.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid unit before calling this
    method. Passing an invalid or null target can lead to undefined behavior or failed
    spell casts. This method does not perform any direct healing calculations; it
    only manages the spell casting process.
