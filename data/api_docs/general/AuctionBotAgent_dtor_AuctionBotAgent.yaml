  signature: void AuctionBotAgent::~AuctionBotAgent()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AuctionBotAgent instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AuctionBotAgent class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the agent's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up internal data structures, canceling any ongoing auctions, and ensuring
    proper shutdown of the bot's operations. In the context of TrinityCore's auction
    house system, this method ensures that no dangling references or memory leaks
    occur when an AuctionBotAgent object is removed from memory. The destructor is
    automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of AuctionBotAgent
    code: 'AuctionBotAgent* agent = new AuctionBotAgent();

      // ... perform operations with the agent ...

      delete agent; // Triggers ~AuctionBotAgent() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless managing memory manually.
    It is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go out of scope or
    are deleted. Ensure that all auction operations are properly finalized before
    the destructor runs to avoid potential inconsistencies in the auction house database.
