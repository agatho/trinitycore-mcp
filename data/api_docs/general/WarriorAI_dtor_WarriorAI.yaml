documentation:
  brief: Destroys a WarriorAI instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The WarriorAI destructor is responsible for cleaning up resources associated
    with a warrior AI instance. It ensures proper deallocation of memory and cleanup
    of any internal data structures or references that were allocated during the lifetime
    of the AI object. This method is automatically invoked when a WarriorAI object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor typically handles releasing
    any dynamically allocated memory, resetting pointers to null, and ensuring no
    dangling references remain in the system. In the context of TrinityCore's AI framework,
    this method is crucial for maintaining memory safety and preventing resource leaks
    when AI entities are removed from the game world.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of WarriorAI instance
    code: 'WarriorAI* ai = new WarriorAI(creature);

      // ... use the AI ...

      delete ai; // This calls the destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via scope
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    WarriorAI ai(creature);\n    // ... use the\
      \ AI ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when ai goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during object cleanup. Developers should
    ensure that any derived classes properly call the base class destructor if they
    override it.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor unless you are implementing custom
    memory management. The destructor handles critical cleanup operations, and calling
    it prematurely can lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks.
