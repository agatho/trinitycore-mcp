  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: InitializeOrchestrator
  signature: bool BotSpawnerAdapter::InitializeOrchestrator()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the orchestrator component for managing bot spawning operations
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The InitializeOrchestrator method sets up and prepares the internal
    orchestrator system responsible for coordinating bot creation, deployment, and
    management tasks. This method typically performs necessary setup operations such
    as initializing data structures, registering callbacks, configuring spawn parameters,
    and ensuring all required subsystems are ready for bot spawning activities. It
    should be called once during the initialization phase of the bot spawner module
    before any actual bot spawning operations can occur. The method returns a boolean
    value indicating whether the initialization was successful or not.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the orchestrator was successfully initialized and all required
    components are ready for use; false otherwise, which may indicate missing dependencies,
    configuration errors, or system resource issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotSpawnerAdapter spawner;\nbool success = spawner.InitializeOrchestrator();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawning operations\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Orchestrator initialized successfully\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle initialization failure\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to initialize orchestrator\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle.
    Subsequent calls may result in undefined behavior or failed initialization attempts.
    The method performs blocking operations and may take several milliseconds to complete
    depending on system resources and configuration complexity.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper preconditions (such as valid configuration
    files or initialized database connections) will likely result in a failed initialization.
    Ensure all required dependencies are available before invoking this method.
