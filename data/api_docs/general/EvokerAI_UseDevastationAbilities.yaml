  class: EvokerAI
  method: UseDevastationAbilities
  signature: void EvokerAI::UseDevastationAbilities(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes devastation abilities for the evoker AI, targeting the specified
    unit.
  description: The UseDevastationAbilities method is responsible for activating and
    managing the use of devastation-type spells or abilities within the EvokerAI class.
    This method typically handles the logic for selecting appropriate devastation
    abilities based on the current combat state, mana availability, and target conditions.
    It integrates with the broader AI framework to ensure strategic spell usage during
    encounters. The method may involve checking for valid targets, evaluating cooldowns,
    and executing the chosen ability against the provided target.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit index or identifier.
      This parameter specifies which entity the devastation abilities should be applied
      to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        UseDevastationAbilities(&targetId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the spell system and AI decision-making
    logic. It's expected to be called from within the main UpdateAI loop or similar
    combat handling functions. The target parameter should always point to a valid
    unit; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly initialized before calling
    this method. Improper use of the target parameter can lead to crashes or incorrect
    AI behavior. This method assumes that the evoker has access to devastation abilities
    and that appropriate conditions for their use are met.
