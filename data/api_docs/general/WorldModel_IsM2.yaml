  signature: bool WorldModel::IsM2() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the world model represents an M2 file format.
  description: The IsM2 method checks if the current WorldModel instance is based
    on the M2 file format, which is used for storing 3D models in World of Warcraft.
    This method returns true if the model data originates from an M2 file and false
    otherwise. The check typically involves examining internal flags or metadata within
    the WorldModel object that indicate its source format. This functionality is essential
    for proper rendering and handling of different model types within the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the world model is an M2 format file; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a WorldModel is M2 format
    code: "WorldModel* model = sMapMgr->GetModel(1234);\nif (model && model->IsM2())\
      \ {\n    // Handle M2 model specific logic\n    printf(\"Model is in M2 format\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle other model formats\n    printf(\"Model is not\
      \ in M2 format\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a simple flag check or type identification internally.
    It's commonly used during model loading and rendering to determine appropriate
    processing paths for different model formats.
