  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleDefensives()
documentation:
  brief: Handles defensive spell casting for the shaman AI during combat.
  description: The HandleDefensives method is responsible for managing the casting
    of defensive spells and abilities by a shaman AI unit. It evaluates the current
    combat situation, checks for available defensive spells such as Earth Shield,
    Healing Stream Totem, or other protective abilities, and determines whether to
    cast them based on the shaman's health status, threat level, and tactical requirements.
    This method is typically invoked during the AI's update cycle to ensure optimal
    use of defensive capabilities in response to incoming damage or hostile actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a defensive spell was successfully cast or queued; otherwise
    returns false if no suitable defensive action was taken or if conditions prevented
    casting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (HandleDefensives())\n\
      \        return;\n    // Continue with other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core shaman AI behavior and integrates with the
    unit's spell casting system. It relies on internal state tracking such as health
    percentage, threat level, and available spell cooldowns to make decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that this method does not interfere with other AI behaviors or
    cause unintended spell spamming in high-frequency update scenarios.
