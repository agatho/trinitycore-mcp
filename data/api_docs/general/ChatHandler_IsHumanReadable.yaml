  brief: Determines whether the chat handler's output is intended for human-readable
    display
  description: The IsHumanReadable method checks if the current ChatHandler instance
    is configured to produce output meant for direct player consumption. This flag
    typically controls formatting and translation of messages, ensuring that output
    is properly localized and formatted for end users rather than being used in automated
    systems or debug contexts. The method returns true when the handler is set up
    for human-readable output, and false otherwise. This functionality is particularly
    relevant in TrinityCore's command system where different types of output may be
    required depending on whether commands are executed by players or through automated
    scripts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the chat handler is configured to produce human-readable
    output, false if it is intended for programmatic use or debugging purposes
  examples:
  - title: Check if chat handler is human readable
    code: "if (handler.IsHumanReadable()) {\n    handler.PSendSysMessage(\"This message\
      \ is formatted for players.\");\n} else {\n    handler.PSendSysMessage(\"Debug\
      \ output format.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in command implementations to determine appropriate
    message formatting and localization behavior. The setting may be influenced by
    the context in which the ChatHandler was created, such as whether it's associated
    with a player session or a console interface.
