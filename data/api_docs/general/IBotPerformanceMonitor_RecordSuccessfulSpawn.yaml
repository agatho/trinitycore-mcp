documentation:
  brief: Records a successful bot spawn event in the performance monitoring system.
  description: The RecordSuccessfulSpawn method is used to log and track successful
    bot spawning events within the TrinityCore AI framework. This method is typically
    invoked by the bot management system when a new bot has been successfully created
    and initialized in the game world. It updates internal performance metrics and
    statistics related to bot deployment, which can be used for monitoring system
    health, performance tuning, and debugging purposes. The method does not require
    any parameters as it operates on the current context of the performance monitor
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Creation Flow
    code: "void BotManager::CreateNewBot()\n{\n    // ... bot creation logic ...\n\
      \    if (bot != nullptr)\n    {\n        sPerformanceMonitor->RecordSuccessfulSpawn();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring infrastructure
    that tracks various bot lifecycle events. It should be called immediately after
    a successful bot spawn to ensure accurate tracking. The implementation may involve
    atomic operations or thread-safe counters to handle concurrent bot spawns.
  warnings: Ensure this method is only called after a successful bot creation process,
    as calling it prematurely may skew performance statistics. In high-concurrency
    environments, verify that the underlying monitoring system can handle rapid successive
    calls without performance degradation.
