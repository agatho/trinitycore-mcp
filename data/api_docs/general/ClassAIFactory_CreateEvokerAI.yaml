documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new evoker AI instance for a bot character
  description: The CreateEvokerAI method is responsible for instantiating a new evoker
    AI behavior for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    allocates memory for the AI component, sets up the necessary configuration parameters,
    and initializes the evoker's spell casting abilities and combat behavior. The
    method typically integrates with the broader AI system to ensure proper coordination
    between different AI types and game mechanics. It may also perform validation
    checks to ensure the bot is in a suitable state before creating the AI instance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or handle.
      This parameter is used to associate the newly created evoker AI with the specific
      bot instance.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid input parameters,
    memory allocation failures, or already existing AI instances.
  examples:
  - title: Basic evoker AI creation
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint result = factory->CreateEvokerAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // AI created successfully\n    printf(\"Evoker AI created for\
      \ bot %d\\n\", botId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ create evoker AI for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI framework and relies on proper
    initialization of the bot system. The bot parameter should point to a valid bot
    instance that has been previously registered with the game world. Memory management
    for the AI instance is handled internally by the factory.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid, initialized bot instance
    before calling this method. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. This method should not be called on bots that already have an active
    AI instance.
