documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot population manager, cleaning up all active bot instances
    and releasing associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all running bot instances managed by
    the BotPopulationManager, ensuring proper cleanup of memory, AI states, and any
    allocated resources. This method is typically invoked during server shutdown or
    when the bot system needs to be disabled temporarily. It ensures that no dangling
    pointers or invalid references remain after termination. The method performs a
    graceful shutdown by notifying all active bots to cease operations and then clears
    internal data structures holding references to these bots.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: BotPopulationManager::instance()->Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a state where no
    active bot operations are occurring, or during controlled shutdown sequences.
    Calling Shutdown while bots are actively processing commands may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks.
