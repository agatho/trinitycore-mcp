  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: CalculateFlexibilityScore
  signature: float RoleOptimizer::CalculateFlexibilityScore(const int & assignments,
    const int & players)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a flexibility score based on role assignments and player count
    for optimal group composition.
  description: The CalculateFlexibilityScore method computes a numerical score representing
    how flexible a group's role distribution is. This score is typically used in group
    finding systems or raid management tools to evaluate the adaptability of a player
    group's role setup. The calculation considers the number of players and their
    current role assignments, with higher scores indicating better flexibility for
    adjusting roles during encounters. The method assumes valid input parameters and
    does not perform explicit validation.
  parameters:
  - name: assignments
    description: The bitmask or integer representation of current role assignments
      for players in the group
  - name: players
    description: Total number of players in the group, used to normalize the flexibility
      calculation
  returns: A float value representing the calculated flexibility score. Higher values
    indicate greater flexibility in role distribution; typically ranges from 0.0 (no
    flexibility) to 1.0 (maximum flexibility).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      int assignments = 0b11110000; // Example bitmask

      int playerCount = 8;

      float score = optimizer.CalculateFlexibilityScore(assignments, playerCount);

      // Score will be between 0.0 and 1.0 based on role distribution'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in group composition analysis
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint raidAssignments = 0b10101010; // Mixed roles\n\
      int totalPlayers = 8;\nfloat flexibility = optimizer.CalculateFlexibilityScore(raidAssignments,\
      \ totalPlayers);\nif (flexibility > 0.75f) {\n    // Group is highly flexible\
      \ for different encounter types\n    printf(\"High flexibility: %f\\n\", flexibility);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses bitwise operations or combinatorial mathematics to
    evaluate role distribution patterns. The implementation may be optimized for performance
    since it's called frequently during group matching and raid management processes.
    It's recommended that callers ensure assignments are properly formatted bitmasks
    representing valid player roles.
  warnings: The method does not validate input parameters, so passing invalid values
    for 'assignments' or 'players' could lead to unexpected results. Ensure that 'players'
    is a positive integer and 'assignments' represents a valid role assignment bitmask.
