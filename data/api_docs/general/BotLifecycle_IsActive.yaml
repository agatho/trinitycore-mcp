documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot lifecycle is currently active and operational.
  description: The IsActive method determines if a bot's lifecycle is currently in
    an active state, meaning the bot is initialized, running, and capable of performing
    actions within the game world. This method typically checks internal flags or
    state variables that indicate whether the bot has completed initialization and
    has not been terminated or disabled. The result of this check is crucial for determining
    if it's safe to perform operations on the bot, such as sending commands, checking
    its status, or interacting with other game entities. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is generally used for conditional logic in bot management
    systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot lifecycle is active and operational; returns false
    if the bot is inactive, uninitialized, or has been terminated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Bot Status
    code: "if (botLifecycle->IsActive()) {\n    // Perform actions only if bot is\
      \ active\n    bot->MoveToTarget();\n} else {\n    // Handle inactive bot case\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Bot is not active.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsActive in a Loop for Continuous Monitoring
    code: "while (true) {\n    if (botLifecycle->IsActive()) {\n        // Bot is\
      \ active, continue with bot logic\n        bot->Update();\n    } else {\n  \
      \      // Bot is inactive, break or handle accordingly\n        break;\n   \
      \ }\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically lightweight and should not cause performance issues
    when called frequently. It's recommended to cache the result of this check if
    it's used multiple times in a single execution context to avoid redundant evaluations.
  warnings: Ensure that you do not perform operations on a bot that is not active,
    as this may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify the return value
    before attempting to interact with the bot.
