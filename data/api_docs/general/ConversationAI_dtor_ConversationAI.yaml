  signature: void ConversationAI::~ConversationAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ConversationAI instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ConversationAI destructor is called automatically when a ConversationAI
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any allocated memory, references to game objects, or internal state
    managed by the AI system. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this destructor handles the release of conversation-related data structures and
    prevents memory leaks when AI instances are removed from the game world. The destruction
    process typically involves releasing references to associated creatures, players,
    or conversation templates that were being tracked by this AI instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ConversationAI object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ConversationAI* ai = new ConversationAI(creature);\n\
      \    // ... use the AI ...\n    delete ai; // Triggers ~ConversationAI()\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack allocation with automatic destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    ConversationAI ai(creature);\n    // AI\
      \ is automatically destroyed when function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It's important to ensure that all references to the AI instance are
    properly cleared before destruction to avoid dangling pointers. The destruction
    process may involve calling cleanup routines on associated game objects or removing
    the AI from internal tracking systems.
  warnings: Never call the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as this
    will result in undefined behavior. Be cautious when managing ConversationAI instances
    in containers or smart pointers to ensure proper lifetime management and avoid
    memory leaks or double-destruction scenarios.
