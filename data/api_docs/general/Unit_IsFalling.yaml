documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently in a falling state.
  description: The IsFalling method checks if a Unit object is currently executing
    a fall animation or is in free-fall mode. This method is commonly used in movement
    mechanics to determine if an entity is in the process of falling, such as during
    jump or fall actions. It typically returns true when the unit is actively falling,
    and false when the unit is either standing still or has landed. The method is
    particularly useful for character movement behavior analysis and can be used to
    detect when a unit is in a state where gravity is affecting its position.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently falling (in free fall), false otherwise.
    This indicates that the unit's movement state includes a falling motion, typically
    due to gravity or jump mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsFalling()) {\n    // Handle falling behavior\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement-related functions
    and can be affected by various factors including gravity, jump mechanics, and
    movement speed. Performance considerations may arise when checking multiple units
    simultaneously during movement updates.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combination with other
    movement state checks as it may interfere with movement logic if not handled properly.
    Avoid using this method in contexts where precise movement control is required
    without proper handling of fall states.
