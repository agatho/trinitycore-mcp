  class: CrowdControlManager
  method: GetPriorityTarget
  signature: Unit * CrowdControlManager::GetPriorityTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current priority target for crowd control effects.
  description: The GetPriorityTarget method returns a pointer to the Unit that is
    currently designated as the priority target for crowd control abilities within
    the CrowdControlManager. This target is typically the unit that crowd control
    effects such as Fear, Stun, or Silence are most likely to be applied to first,
    based on AI decision-making logic and targeting priorities. The returned Unit
    pointer may be null if no valid priority target exists or if the manager has not
    yet determined one. This method is commonly used in AI behavior scripts to determine
    which unit should be targeted next for crowd control effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit that represents the current priority target for crowd
    control effects, or nullptr if no valid target exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "Unit* target = crowdControlManager->GetPriorityTarget();\nif (target &&\
      \ !target->IsDead()) {\n    // Apply crowd control effect to the priority target\n\
      \    DoCrowdControlEffect(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Target Validity Before Use
    code: "Unit* priorityTarget = crowdControlManager->GetPriorityTarget();\nif (priorityTarget\
      \ && !priorityTarget->IsInWorld()) {\n    // Handle invalid target case\n  \
      \  Log(\"Invalid priority target detected\");\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with\
      \ targeting logic\nApplyCrowdControl(priorityTarget);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and may be influenced
    by factors such as threat levels, unit positioning, and target selection rules.
    The returned Unit pointer should not be stored for extended periods as the priority
    target may change frequently.
  warnings: The returned Unit pointer may be null, so always check for nullptr before
    using it. Additionally, the target may become invalid or die between when this
    method is called and when the crowd control effect is applied.
