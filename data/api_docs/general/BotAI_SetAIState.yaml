  class: BotAI
  method: SetAIState
  signature: void BotAI::SetAIState(BotAIState state)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the current AI state of the bot to the specified state value.
  description: The SetAIState method is used to change the operational mode or behavior
    state of a bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method allows developers
    and scripters to control how a bot interacts with the game world by transitioning
    it between different predefined AI states such as idle, combat, movement, or following.
    The method directly modifies internal bot state variables and may trigger corresponding
    state-specific behaviors in the bot's AI logic. It is typically called during
    bot initialization, state transitions, or in response to game events that require
    a change in bot behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: The BotAIState enum value representing the desired AI state for the
      bot. Valid values include but are not limited to IDLE, COMBAT, MOVING, FOLLOWING,
      and others defined in the BotAIState enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a bot to idle state
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = player->GetBotAI();

      botAI->SetAIState(BotAIState::IDLE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Transitioning bot to combat state
    code: "if (player->GetBotAI()->GetTarget()) {\n    player->GetBotAI()->SetAIState(BotAIState::COMBAT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal AI state of the bot and should
    be used carefully to avoid unexpected behavior. The actual implementation may
    involve triggering callbacks or updating internal FSM (Finite State Machine) states.
    It's recommended to validate the input state value before calling this method
    to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling SetAIState with an invalid or unsupported BotAIState value may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that the state being set
    is a valid member of the BotAIState enumeration. Avoid frequent state changes
    without proper cooldowns as it might cause performance issues or interrupt ongoing
    AI processes.
