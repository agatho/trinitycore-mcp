  brief: Moves the contents of another PathGenerator instance to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the right-hand side PathGenerator object to the left-hand side object. This operation
    is typically used to efficiently transfer path data and internal state without
    performing expensive deep copies. The moved-from object is left in a valid but
    unspecified state, suitable for immediate reuse or destruction. In the context
    of TrinityCore's pathfinding system, this operator enables efficient resource
    management when reassigning path generators, particularly during dynamic path
    updates or when swapping pathfinding results.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current PathGenerator object after the move assignment
    has completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'PathGenerator generator1;

      PathGenerator generator2 = std::move(generator1); // Move-assigns generator1
      to generator2

      // generator1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Pathfinding Context
    code: 'PathGenerator path1;

      PathGenerator path2;

      // ... populate path1 with path data ...

      path2 = std::move(path1); // Efficiently transfer path data

      // path1 is now empty and can be reused or destroyed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation, which typically involves transferring
    pointers or handles rather than copying large data structures. The moved-from
    object should not be used after the operation unless it's immediately reassigned
    or destroyed. In TrinityCore's pathfinding system, this is particularly useful
    for avoiding expensive memory allocations when updating path results dynamically.
  warnings: After move assignment, the source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state. Using the moved-from object without reassignment may lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that any pointers or references to the moved-from object are
    not dereferenced after the operation.
