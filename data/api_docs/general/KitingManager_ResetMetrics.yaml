  class: KitingManager
  method: ResetMetrics
  signature: void KitingManager::ResetMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all kiting-related performance metrics and counters to their initial
    state.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated kiting statistics and
    performance data within the KitingManager instance. This includes resetting internal
    counters, timers, and any recorded metric values that track player movement efficiency
    or kiting behavior during combat. The method is typically invoked when starting
    a new kiting session or when metrics need to be cleared for analysis purposes.
    It ensures a clean slate for subsequent kiting performance tracking without carrying
    over data from previous sessions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'KitingManager* manager = player->GetKitingManager();

      manager->ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Combat Reset Context
    code: "void OnCombatEnd(Player* player)\n{\n    KitingManager* manager = player->GetKitingManager();\n\
      \    if (manager)\n    {\n        manager->ResetMetrics();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before beginning new kiting performance analysis
    to ensure accurate measurements. The reset operation is atomic and does not affect
    other manager functionalities or player state.
  warnings: Calling ResetMetrics during active combat or kiting sessions may result
    in loss of important performance data that was being tracked. Ensure this method
    is only invoked when it's safe to discard existing metrics.
