  class: Creature
  method: IsIgnoringChaseRange
  signature: bool Creature::IsIgnoringChaseRange() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature ignores chase range limitations during combat.
  description: This method checks if a creature is configured to ignore the standard
    chase range restrictions that normally apply to NPC behavior. When a creature
    ignores chase range, it can pursue players beyond normal distance limits without
    being restricted by the game's movement mechanics. This is particularly useful
    for creatures that need to maintain combat with players across large distances
    or when implementing special AI behaviors where distance limitations should not
    apply.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature ignores chase range, false otherwise. The
    value indicates whether the creature's movement behavior bypasses normal distance
    constraints during combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsIgnoringChaseRange()) {\n    // Creature can pursue player\
      \ beyond normal range\n    // Implement special AI logic here\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AI behavior modifications
    and may be set by game master commands or through creature template settings.
    Implementation details involve checking internal flags that control movement behavior.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it can affect normal gameplay
    mechanics and may cause unexpected behavior if not properly implemented. The method
    should only be used in special cases where distance limitations need to be overridden.
