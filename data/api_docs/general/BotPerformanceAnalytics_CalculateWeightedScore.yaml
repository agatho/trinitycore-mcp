  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: CalculateWeightedScore
  signature: double BotPerformanceAnalytics::CalculateWeightedScore(const std::array<double,
    10> & scores) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a weighted performance score based on ten input metrics for bot
    analytics.
  description: The CalculateWeightedScore method computes a normalized weighted score
    from an array of ten performance metrics. This method is typically used within
    the BotPerformanceAnalytics class to evaluate and rank bot performance across
    multiple dimensions such as efficiency, accuracy, response time, and resource
    usage. The calculation applies predefined weights to each metric to reflect their
    relative importance in determining overall bot effectiveness. The input array
    must contain exactly ten double-precision floating-point values representing individual
    performance scores. This method does not modify any internal state and is designed
    to be thread-safe for concurrent access during performance analysis operations.
  parameters:
  - name: scores
    description: An array of exactly ten double values representing individual performance
      metrics. Each value should be within a reasonable range (typically 0.0 to 1.0)
      that reflects the normalized score for each performance dimension.
  returns: A double-precision floating-point number representing the weighted composite
    score of all input metrics. The returned value typically ranges between 0.0 and
    1.0, where higher values indicate better overall bot performance. In edge cases
    with invalid inputs, the method may return 0.0 or NaN depending on implementation
    details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::array<double, 10> performanceScores = {0.85, 0.92, 0.78, 0.95, 0.88,
      0.91, 0.83, 0.89, 0.94, 0.87};

      BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      double overallScore = analytics.CalculateWeightedScore(performanceScores);

      // Result: A weighted composite score between 0.0 and 1.0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis with Multiple Bots
    code: "#include <vector>\nstd::vector<std::array<double, 10>> botScores = {\n\
      \    {0.85, 0.92, 0.78, 0.95, 0.88, 0.91, 0.83, 0.89, 0.94, 0.87},\n    {0.75,\

      \ analytics;\nfor (const auto& scores : botScores) {\n    double score = analytics.CalculateWeightedScore(scores);\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Bot Score: \" << score << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input array contains exactly ten elements and
    that each element is a valid double value. The weighting scheme used internally
    is not exposed publicly but is likely defined as part of the class implementation.
    For optimal performance, ensure that the input values are normalized to a consistent
    scale (e.g., 0.0-1.0) before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing an array with fewer or more than ten elements will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure all input values are within valid ranges to avoid unexpected
    results. This method does not perform bounds checking on the input array, so callers
    must validate input data before use.
