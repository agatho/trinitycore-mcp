  class: FeralDruid
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool FeralDruid::CanUseAbility(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a Feral Druid can use a specified spell ability based
    on current game state and resource requirements.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a Feral Druid character is eligible
    to cast or activate a specific spell ability. It checks various conditions such
    as mana or energy requirements, stance restrictions, cooldowns, and other gameplay
    mechanics relevant to the druid's feral form. This method is typically used by
    AI systems or game logic to validate spell usage before execution. The function
    returns true if all prerequisites are met and false otherwise, ensuring that abilities
    are only used when appropriate within the context of the game rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Feral Druid can use the specified spell ability; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (druid->CanUseAbility(SPELL_RIP)) {\n    // Execute the Rip spell\n\
      \    druid->CastSpell(target, SPELL_RIP);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Activation
    code: "uint32 abilityId = SPELL_MOONFIRE;\nif (druid->CanUseAbility(abilityId))\
      \ {\n    druid->CastSpell(target, abilityId);\n} else {\n    // Handle inability\
      \ to cast (e.g., out of mana)\n    druid->Say(\"I cannot cast that right now.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with internal cooldown tracking, resource management
    (like energy or rage), and stance validation. It may also consider the character's
    current form (e.g., not allowing certain spells in non-feral forms). Developers
    should be aware that this check does not account for target validity or line-of-sight;
    those checks are typically performed separately.
  warnings: Do not assume that a spell can be cast just because CanUseAbility returns
    true. Additional validation such as target checks, range, and LOS should still
    be performed before casting. Also, some abilities might have dynamic requirements
    that change during combat, so calling this method multiple times in rapid succession
    could yield inconsistent results.
