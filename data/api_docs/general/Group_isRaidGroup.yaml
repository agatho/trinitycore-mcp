  signature: bool Group::isRaidGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group is a raid group.
  description: The isRaidGroup() method checks if the current Group object represents
    a raid group as opposed to a regular party. In World of Warcraft terminology,
    a raid group typically consists of 10 or more players and is used for instance
    content such as dungeons, raids, and other large-scale encounters. This method
    returns true if the group has been configured as a raid group, which affects various
    gameplay mechanics including loot distribution, role assignments, and instance
    management. The method does not modify any internal state of the group but simply
    evaluates its current configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group is a raid group (contains 10 or more members),
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a group is a raid group
    code: "if (group->isRaidGroup()) {\n    // Handle raid-specific logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      This is a raid group.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle party-specific logic\n  \
      \  sLog->outString(\"This is a regular party.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal group size and configuration flags to
    determine if it's a raid. It does not perform any external API calls or database
    lookups, making it efficient for frequent checks. The result may change dynamically
    if players join or leave the group.
