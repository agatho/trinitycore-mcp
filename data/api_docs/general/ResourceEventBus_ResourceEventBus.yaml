  class: ResourceEventBus
  method: ResourceEventBus
  signature: void ResourceEventBus::ResourceEventBus()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ResourceEventBus class for handling resource-related
    events in the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The ResourceEventBus constructor initializes the event bus system used
    for managing and dispatching resource-related events within the TrinityCore server.
    This class serves as a central hub for coordinating various resource management
    operations such as item acquisition, currency changes, and resource consumption.
    The initialization process sets up internal data structures and registers necessary
    callbacks to ensure proper event handling throughout the game session. This constructor
    is typically called during server startup or when a new resource event handler
    needs to be instantiated.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ResourceEventBus Initialization
    code: 'ResourceEventBus eventBus;

      // The eventBus is now ready to handle resource events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ResourceEventBus in a Custom Module
    code: "#include \"ResourceEventBus.h\"\n\nvoid InitializeCustomResourceManager()\n\
      {\n    static ResourceEventBus g_ResourceEventBus;\n    // Register event handlers\
      \ here\n}\n\n// Usage in game logic\nvoid OnPlayerItemGain(Player* player, ItemTemplate\
      \ const* itemTemplate)\n{\n    g_ResourceEventBus.DispatchResourceEvent(player,\
      \ itemTemplate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The ResourceEventBus constructor does not perform any heavy initialization
    work. It primarily sets up internal structures and is expected to be called in
    a thread-safe context during server initialization or module loading. Multiple
    instances of ResourceEventBus can exist simultaneously, though typically only
    one global instance is used for consistency.
  warnings: Do not instantiate ResourceEventBus objects in performance-critical code
    paths as the constructor may perform non-trivial setup operations. Avoid creating
    multiple instances unless specifically required for event isolation purposes.
