  method: CalculateGroupCenterPoint
  signature: int InstanceCoordination::CalculateGroupCenterPoint(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the central point of a group's members within an instance.
  description: The CalculateGroupCenterPoint method determines the geometric center
    point of all players currently in a specified group. This calculation is typically
    used for positioning purposes within instance scenarios, such as determining where
    to spawn NPCs or objects relative to the group's location. The method takes into
    account each member's current position and computes an average coordinate that
    represents the group's collective center. It returns an integer identifier representing
    the calculated center point, which may be used for further spatial calculations
    or instance management operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the calculated group center point identifier.
    This identifier can be used to reference or locate the computed central position
    within the instance's coordinate system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    int centerPoint\
      \ = instanceCoordination->CalculateGroupCenterPoint(myGroup);\n    // Use centerPoint\
      \ for further calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all group members are within the same instance and
    that their positions are valid. The returned integer may represent an internal
    identifier or index used by the instance coordination system, rather than a direct
    coordinate value.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter is not null and contains valid players
    before calling this method. Calling this method on an empty or invalid group may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
