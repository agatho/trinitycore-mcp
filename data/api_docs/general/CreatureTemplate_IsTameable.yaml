  signature: bool CreatureTemplate::IsTameable(bool canTameExotic, const CreatureDifficulty
    * creatureDifficulty) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature template can be tamed by players.
  description: The IsTameable method checks if a creature template is eligible to
    be tamed by players. This method evaluates various conditions including creature
    type, difficulty settings, and whether exotic pets are allowed. It returns true
    if the creature can be tamed, false otherwise. The method considers both standard
    tameable creatures and exotic pets based on the provided parameter. In World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this is used during pet creation and taming
    mechanics to validate if a creature can be domesticated by players.
  parameters:
  - name: canTameExotic
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether exotic pets can be tamed. When true,
      allows taming of exotic creatures; when false, only regular tameable creatures
      are considered.
  - name: creatureDifficulty
    description: Pointer to a CreatureDifficulty structure that contains difficulty-specific
      settings for the creature. This may affect tameability based on player level
      or other difficulty modifiers.
  returns: Returns true if the creature template is tameable (either regular or exotic
    depending on canTameExotic flag), false otherwise. The method will return false
    for creatures that are inherently not tameable, such as bosses, mechanical creatures,
    or those with specific flags preventing taming.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if creature is tameable
    code: "if (creatureTemplate->IsTameable(false, nullptr)) {\n    // Creature can\
      \ be tamed\n    printf(\"Creature is tameable\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Creature\
      \ cannot be tamed\n    printf(\"Creature is not tameable\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check tameability with exotic pets allowed
    code: "CreatureDifficulty difficulty;\n// Set difficulty settings...\nif (creatureTemplate->IsTameable(true,\
      \ &difficulty)) {\n    // Creature can be tamed including exotic variants\n\
      \    printf(\"Creature is tameable including exotics\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal creature flags and difficulty settings. The
    implementation may vary depending on the specific creature template's attributes
    in the database. It should be called during pet creation or taming validation
    processes. Performance is generally good as it only performs flag checks and simple
    comparisons.
  warnings: Ensure that the CreatureDifficulty pointer is valid before passing to
    avoid potential crashes. This method does not validate player level or other contextual
    requirements for taming - those are handled separately in the taming process.
