  class: BotScheduler
  method: RemovePattern
  signature: bool BotScheduler::RemovePattern(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified pattern from the bot scheduler's collection of patterns.
  description: The RemovePattern method removes a pattern identified by its name from
    the internal collection managed by the BotScheduler. This method is typically
    used to clean up or modify the behavior configurations of bots within the TrinityCore
    framework. It returns true if the pattern was successfully found and removed,
    or false if the pattern does not exist in the scheduler's registry. The operation
    ensures that any subsequent scheduling attempts for the removed pattern will fail
    unless a new pattern with the same name is added.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier string of the pattern to be removed from the
      scheduler. This must match exactly with an existing pattern's name in the system.
  returns: True if the pattern was successfully located and removed; false if no pattern
    with the given name exists in the scheduler.
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Pattern by Name
    code: "if (botScheduler.RemovePattern(\"default_combat_pattern\")) {\n    // Pattern\
      \ successfully removed\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Removed combat pattern successfully.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Pattern not found\n    LOG_WARNING(\"bot\", \"Attempted\
      \ to remove non-existent pattern.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the pattern name is case-sensitive and must exactly
    match the stored pattern identifier. It should be used carefully in multi-threaded
    environments where patterns may be added or removed concurrently.
  warnings: Calling this method with a non-existent pattern name will return false
    but will not throw an exception. Ensure proper validation of pattern existence
    before calling to avoid unintended behavior.
