api:
  class: CalendarEvent
  method: SetGuildId
  signature: void CalendarEvent::SetGuildId(int guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the guild identifier associated with the calendar event.
  description: The SetGuildId method assigns a specific guild ID to a calendar event,
    linking it to a particular guild within the World of Warcraft realm. This association
    is crucial for guild-specific events and determines which guild members can view
    or interact with the event. The method directly modifies an internal member variable
    of the CalendarEvent class without performing any validation checks on the provided
    guild ID. It's typically used during event creation or modification when a guild
    affiliation needs to be established or updated.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild to associate with this calendar
      event. A value of 0 indicates no guild association.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Guild ID for a Calendar Event
    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      // Assume we have a valid guild with ID 12345

      event.SetGuildId(12345);

      // The event is now associated with guild ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Guild Association from Calendar Event
    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      // Remove guild association by setting ID to 0

      event.SetGuildId(0);

      // The event is now unassociated with any guild'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the CalendarEvent object.
    It does not perform any database operations or send updates to clients; those
    actions must be handled separately by calling code. The method assumes that the
    provided guild ID is valid and exists in the game's data structures.
  warnings: Setting an invalid guild ID (e.g., one that doesn't exist) may lead to
    unexpected behavior when displaying or processing the calendar event. It's recommended
    to validate the guild ID before calling this method if the source is user-provided
    or uncertain.
