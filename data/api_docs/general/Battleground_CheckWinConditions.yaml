documentation:
  brief: Evaluates current battleground state to determine if win conditions have
    been met
  description: The CheckWinConditions method is responsible for assessing whether
    the current battleground has reached a state where one faction has won based on
    the specific rules of that battleground type. This method typically checks objectives
    such as capturing points, defeating players, or achieving other victory criteria
    defined by the battleground's game mechanics. It is called periodically during
    battleground operation and may trigger win/loss events, update player scores,
    and handle reward distribution. The method does not directly modify gameplay state
    but rather evaluates it to determine if a win condition has been satisfied.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground update loop
    code: "void Battleground::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\
      \ ...\n    CheckWinConditions();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the battleground's regular update
    cycle and should not be called manually unless implementing custom win condition
    logic. The implementation may vary significantly between different battleground
    types (e.g., Warsong Gulch vs. Arathi Basin).
