documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all quest relations associated with a game object entry.
  description: The GetGOQuestRelations method fetches all quest relationships for
    a specified game object entry from the database. This function is used to determine
    which quests are linked to a particular game object, such as quest givers or quest
    objectives. The returned result typically contains mappings between quest IDs
    and the associated game object entries, enabling the core to properly handle quest
    interactions when players interact with these objects. This method plays a crucial
    role in the quest system's ability to track which quests are active based on player
    interaction with world objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A QuestRelationResult object containing all quest relations for the specified
    game object entry. The result typically includes mappings of quest IDs to their
    relationship types (e.g., quest start, quest end) associated with the given game
    object entry.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Quest Relations for a Game Object
    code: "QuestRelationResult relations = sObjectMgr->GetGOQuestRelations(176345);\n\
      for (auto& relation : relations)\n{\n    uint32 questId = relation.first;\n\
      \    uint32 type = relation.second;\n    // Process the quest relation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the database to retrieve quest-object relationships.
    It is typically called during server startup or when loading quest data, and should
    not be invoked frequently in performance-critical code paths. The returned QuestRelationResult
    is usually cached internally by the ObjectMgr for performance reasons.
