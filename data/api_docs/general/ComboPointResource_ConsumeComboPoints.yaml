documentation:
  brief: Consumes all available combo points from the resource pool
  description: The ConsumeComboPoints method is responsible for depleting the current
    combo point resource, typically used in game mechanics where combo points are
    spent to execute abilities or spells. This method likely reduces the internal
    counter of combo points to zero and may trigger related events or updates in the
    player's state. The operation is generally irreversible without explicit replenishment
    through other game systems such as abilities that restore combo points or natural
    regeneration.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ComboPointResource resource;

      resource.ConsumeComboPoints();

      // All combo points are now consumed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during ability execution when combo points
    are required as a cost. It's important to ensure that the resource has sufficient
    combo points before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior or game state
    inconsistencies.
