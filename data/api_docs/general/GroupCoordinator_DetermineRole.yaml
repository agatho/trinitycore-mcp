  method: DetermineRole
  signature: GroupRole GroupCoordinator::DetermineRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the role of the player within the group coordinator's
    context.
  description: The DetermineRole method evaluates the current state and responsibilities
    of the player within a group coordination system, returning an appropriate GroupRole
    enumeration that defines their functional role. This method is typically used
    in group management systems such as raid leaders, tanks, healers, or damage dealers.
    The determination may consider factors like class specialization, gear, combat
    role, and group assignment. It serves as a core component for dynamic group balancing,
    role-based abilities, and player positioning within the game's group mechanics.
    This method does not modify any internal state but provides read-only access to
    the current role assignment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupRole enum value indicating the player's assigned role in the group.
    Possible values include GROUP_ROLE_TANK, GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE,
    and others depending on the implementation and game context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Determination
    code: "GroupRole role = groupCoordinator.DetermineRole();\nif (role == GROUP_ROLE_TANK)\n\
      {\n    // Handle tank-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role-Based Action Execution
    code: "GroupRole role = groupCoordinator.DetermineRole();\nswitch (role)\n{\n\
      \    case GROUP_ROLE_HEALER:\n        // Execute healing behavior\n        break;\n\
      \    case GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE:\n        // Execute damage-dealing behavior\n \
      \       break;\n    default:\n        // Default group behavior\n        break;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group updates or role reassignments.
    It may cache results for performance reasons, so frequent calls might not reflect
    real-time changes unless the underlying group state has been updated. The method
    assumes that the GroupCoordinator instance has valid group membership and player
    data.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned role remains static; roles can change
    dynamically during group activities such as switching specs or reassigning positions.
    Calling this method in high-frequency loops may impact performance if caching
    is not implemented properly.
