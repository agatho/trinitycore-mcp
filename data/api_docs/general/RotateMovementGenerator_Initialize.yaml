  class: RotateMovementGenerator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void RotateMovementGenerator::Initialize(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the rotation movement generator with specified parameters.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the RotateMovementGenerator for use,
    configuring its internal state based on provided parameters. This method is typically
    called during the initialization phase of a creature or unit's movement behavior.
    It prepares the generator to perform rotational movements, such as turning in
    place or rotating toward a target. The method does not directly control movement
    execution but rather configures the generator's parameters for subsequent movement
    operations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that defines rotation behavior. Valid
      values typically include rotation speed, direction flags, or duration settings
      depending on implementation context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'RotateMovementGenerator rotator;

      int rotationSpeed = 100;

      rotator.Initialize(&rotationSpeed);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any movement execution to ensure proper
    configuration. The parameter value pointed to by param0 is crucial for determining
    the generator's behavior and must be set appropriately for desired rotation effects.
