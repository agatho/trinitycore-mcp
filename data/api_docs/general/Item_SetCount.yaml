  method: SetCount
  signature: void Item::SetCount(uint32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the stack count of the item to the specified value.
  description: The SetCount method modifies the stack count of an Item object, determining
    how many items are in a single stack. This is commonly used for items that can
    stack, such as potions, food, or currency items. The method updates the internal
    data structure and triggers necessary game mechanics to reflect the new stack
    count. It should be used carefully as it affects item behavior and can influence
    player inventory management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Item Stack Count
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetCount(5);

      // Sets the item''s stack count to 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the item's internal stack count field. It should
    be used in conjunction with proper inventory management to ensure accurate game
    state representation. The method may trigger updates to the item's display and
    behavior depending on the context.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect item stacking behavior,
    potentially causing issues with inventory management or game mechanics. Ensure
    that the value passed is valid for the item type (e.g., not exceeding maximum
    stack size).
