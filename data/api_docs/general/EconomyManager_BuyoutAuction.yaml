  signature: bool EconomyManager::BuyoutAuction(uint32 auctionId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the buyout of an auction item, completing the transaction and transferring
    ownership.
  description: The BuyoutAuction method handles the purchase of an auction item using
    its buyout price. It validates that the auction exists and is active, checks if
    the player has sufficient funds, and processes the transaction by transferring
    the buyout amount from the buyer to the seller and handing over the item. This
    method ensures proper auction house mechanics are followed, including updating
    auction records, notifying players, and managing in-game currency. The method
    returns true upon successful completion of the buyout process, or false if any
    validation fails or the transaction cannot be completed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the auction was successfully bought out and the transaction
    completed, false otherwise. Possible failure reasons include invalid auction ID,
    insufficient funds, or auction already sold.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Buyout Usage
    code: "if (EconomyManager::BuyoutAuction(12345)) {\n    // Auction successfully\
      \ bought out\n    printf(\"Auction bought out successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to buy out auction\n    printf(\"Failed to buy out auction\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player selects an item in the auction
    house and chooses to buy it immediately using its buyout price rather than placing
    a bid. It assumes that all necessary preconditions (such as player authentication,
    valid auction ID, and sufficient funds) are already checked before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that the auction ID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    auction; otherwise, the method will return false without performing any transaction.
    Also, be aware that this method may have side effects such as sending mail notifications
    to the seller upon successful completion.
