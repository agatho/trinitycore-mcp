  class: LootStore
  method: Verify
  signature: void LootStore::Verify() const
documentation:
  brief: Validates the integrity of loot store data structures and entries.
  description: The Verify method performs a comprehensive check on the internal data
    structures of a LootStore instance to ensure all loot entries are properly formatted
    and consistent. It validates that item IDs reference existing items in the game
    database, checks for duplicate entries, verifies probability distributions, and
    ensures all required fields are present and within valid ranges. This method is
    typically used during server startup or maintenance to identify corrupted loot
    data before it can cause issues during gameplay. The verification process helps
    maintain data integrity and prevents potential crashes or unexpected behavior
    when loot is distributed to players.

  - title: Basic Verification Usage
    code: 'LootStore* store = sLootMgr->GetLootStore("creature_loot_template");

      store->Verify();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and maintenance purposes.
    It may be computationally expensive when dealing with large loot stores, so it's
    typically only called during server initialization or administrative commands
    rather than during active gameplay. The verification process does not modify any
    data but will log warnings or errors to the console if inconsistencies are found.
  warnings: Calling Verify() on a LootStore that is actively being modified by other
    threads may produce inconsistent results. It should only be called when the loot
    store is in a stable state, typically during server startup or maintenance windows.
