documentation:
  brief: Deletes the garrison associated with the current player
  description: The Delete method removes the garrison instance from the game world
    for the player who owns it. This operation typically involves cleaning up all
    garrison-related data including buildings, followers, and resources. The method
    is usually invoked when a player decides to abandon or destroy their garrison,
    which may occur during gameplay events such as faction changes, server resets,
    or administrative actions. The deletion process ensures that all related database
    entries are properly removed and memory is freed accordingly.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nif (garrison)\n{\n    garrison->Delete();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player has proper permissions
    and the garrison is in a state that allows deletion. It may trigger additional
    cleanup operations such as removing follower data, destroying buildings, and updating
    related database records.
  warnings: Calling this method on a garrison that is currently in use or being modified
    by other systems may cause undefined behavior or data corruption. Always verify
    the garrison's state before invoking Delete().
