documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the SupportMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the SupportMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the support manager exists throughout
    the application. This method is commonly used to access global support functionality
    such as handling player queries, managing support tickets, or providing in-game
    assistance systems. The returned pointer is guaranteed to be valid and should
    not be deleted by the caller. This method is thread-safe and can be called from
    any context within the TrinityCore server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single instance of SupportMgr. The return value is never
    null in normal operation, as the singleton pattern ensures its creation upon first
    access.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SupportMgr* support = SupportMgr::instance();

      // Use the support manager instance to handle player queries'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Support Functionality
    code: "SupportMgr* mgr = SupportMgr::instance();\nif (mgr)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ support-related operations\n    mgr->HandlePlayerQuery(playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The instance
    is created on first call and persists for the lifetime of the application. Developers
    should be aware that this is a global access point, so excessive use may impact
    testability or make code harder to mock in unit tests.
