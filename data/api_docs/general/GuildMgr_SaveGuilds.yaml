documentation:
  brief: Saves all guild data to the database
  description: The SaveGuilds method persists all currently loaded guild information
    to the TrinityCore database. This method iterates through all active guilds in
    memory and writes their state, including guild members, ranks, and other attributes,
    to the appropriate database tables. It is typically invoked during server shutdown
    or periodic save intervals to ensure data persistence. The operation is blocking
    and may impact performance during high-traffic periods due to database I/O operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Shutdown
    code: "void World::UpdateWorldState()\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n    sGuildMgr->SaveGuilds();\n\
      \    // ... continue shutdown process ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a stable state to
    avoid data corruption. It performs database writes synchronously, which can cause
    temporary blocking of the main thread. Consider calling this during low-traffic
    periods or during server maintenance windows.
  warnings: Calling this method while guilds are actively being modified may result
    in inconsistent data states. Ensure no guild operations are in progress before
    invoking SaveGuilds to prevent race conditions.
