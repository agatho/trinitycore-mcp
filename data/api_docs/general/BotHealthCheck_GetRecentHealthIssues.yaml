  signature: int BotHealthCheck::GetRecentHealthIssues() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of recent health-related issues detected for a bot.
  description: The GetRecentHealthIssues method returns an integer value representing
    the number of recent health problems or anomalies detected for a specific bot
    instance. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore AI framework to
    monitor and evaluate the condition of automated player characters (bots). The
    returned value may be used by other systems to trigger alerts, initiate healing
    routines, or adjust bot behavior based on its current health status. The method
    does not modify any internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the count of recent health issues detected for
    the bot. A value of 0 indicates no recent health problems, while higher values
    indicate increasing severity or frequency of health-related events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int issues = botHealthCheck.GetRecentHealthIssues();\nif (issues > 0) {\n\
      \    // Handle health issue\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot has %d recent health\
      \ issues.\", issues);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Bot Health
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void CheckBotHealth(BotHealthCheck& healthCheck)\
      \ {\n        int issues = healthCheck.GetRecentHealthIssues();\n        if (issues\
      \ >= 5) {\n            // Trigger emergency healing\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      Emergency healing required for bot.\");\n        } else if (issues > 0) {\n\
      \            // Log minor health concerns\n            sLog->outString(\"Minor\
      \ health issues detected: %d\", issues);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI health monitoring system and should be
    called regularly to maintain accurate health status tracking. The internal logic
    for determining what constitutes a 'health issue' may vary based on implementation
    details and configuration settings.
  warnings: The return value represents only recent issues and does not provide detailed
    information about specific problems. Developers should ensure proper handling
    of zero values to avoid unnecessary processing or false alarms.
