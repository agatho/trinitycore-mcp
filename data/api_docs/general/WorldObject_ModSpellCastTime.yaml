  signature: void WorldObject::ModSpellCastTime(const SpellInfo * spellInfo, int32
    & castTime, Spell * spell) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies spell cast time for a given spell.
  description: This method adjusts the casting time of a spell based on the provided
    SpellInfo structure and modifies the castTime parameter accordingly. It is used
    to apply various modifiers such as haste, slow, or other game mechanics that affect
    spell casting duration. The method operates on the WorldObject's current spell
    cast time and can be used to modify spell durations for different types of spells
    including instant, normal, or channeled spells.
  parameters:
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure that defines the spell being modified.
      This contains information about the spell's casting time and other properties.
  - name: castTime
    description: Reference to the cast time value that will be modified by this method.
      This represents the current casting time in milliseconds that is adjusted based
      on modifiers applied.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object that is being cast. This allows for additional
      context about the spell being modified, such as whether it's a channeled spell
      or not.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);

      int32 castTime = 1000;

      Spell* spell = new Spell(this, spellInfo);

      ModSpellCastTime(spellInfo, castTime, spell);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with haste
    code: 'SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);

      int32 castTime = 1000;

      Spell* spell = new Spell(this, spellInfo);

      ModSpellCastTime(spellInfo, castTime, spell);

      // castTime now represents modified time after applying haste effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to adjust spell casting times. It should be called before the spell is actually
    cast to ensure proper timing adjustments. Implementation details include handling
    of various modifiers and potential conflicts between different spell effects.
  warnings: Care must be taken when modifying castTime as incorrect modifications
    can lead to unexpected behavior in spell casting. This method should not be used
    for direct manipulation of spell duration without proper context and understanding
    of the spell's properties.
