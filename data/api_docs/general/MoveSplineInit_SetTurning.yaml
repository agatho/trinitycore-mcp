  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: SetTurning
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetTurning(float startFacing, float totalTurnRads,
    float radsPerSec)
documentation:
  brief: Configures the spline to perform a turning movement with specified starting
    facing, total turn angle, and rotation speed.
  description: The SetTurning method initializes a turning motion for an object's
    movement spline. It sets up the spline to rotate from a given starting facing
    direction through a specified total turn angle at a defined rotational speed.
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore for controlling NPC or
    player character rotations during movement animations, ensuring smooth and realistic
    turning behavior. The method prepares the spline data structure for execution
    of the turning motion, typically called before initiating movement with other
    spline methods. It does not execute the turn itself but configures the parameters
    needed for the actual rotation to occur during spline execution.
  parameters:
  - name: startFacing
    description: The initial facing direction in radians from which the turning motion
      begins. This represents the object's current orientation before the turn starts.
  - name: totalTurnRads
    description: The total angle of rotation in radians that the object will perform.
      Positive values indicate clockwise rotation, negative values indicate counter-clockwise
      rotation.
  - name: radsPerSec
    description: The rotational speed in radians per second at which the turn will
      be executed. This controls how quickly the object completes the turning motion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Turning Setup
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetTurning(M_PI_2, M_PI, 1.0f); // Turn 180 degrees clockwise at
      1 radian per second from facing 90 degrees'
    language: cpp
  - title: Counter-Clockwise Rotation
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetTurning(0.0f, -M_PI_4, 0.5f); // Turn 45 degrees counter-clockwise
      at 0.5 radians per second from facing 0 degrees'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal spline parameters that will be used during
    the actual movement execution. The turning motion is typically combined with other
    spline settings like movement speed and waypoints. The rotation is calculated
    using spherical linear interpolation (slerp) for smooth transitions. This method
    should generally be called before any movement-related methods to ensure proper
    initialization of the turning behavior.
  warnings: "Calling this method after movement has already begun may result in unexpected\
    \ behavior or incomplete turning animation. Ensure that startFacing is within\
    \ valid range (typically -2\u03C0 to 2\u03C0 radians). The totalTurnRads parameter\
    \ can be positive or negative, but large absolute values may cause performance\
    \ issues or appear unnatural in game context."
