  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadSpawnTrackingStates()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spawn tracking states for all game objects and creatures
    in the world.
  description: The LoadSpawnTrackingStates method is responsible for loading spawn
    tracking data from the database into memory. This data tracks the current spawn
    status of game objects and creatures, including their respawn timers, spawn coordinates,
    and other relevant state information. The method typically executes during server
    startup or when reloading spawn data to ensure that all entities are correctly
    initialized with their proper spawn states. It integrates with the core object
    management system to maintain accurate tracking of dynamic world elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadAllData()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadSpawnTrackingStates();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    operations. It may involve significant database queries and should be considered
    when optimizing server boot times. The method assumes that the database connection
    is already established and that spawn tracking tables exist with proper schema.
  warnings: Calling this method while the server is actively running may cause inconsistencies
    in spawn tracking data. It should only be invoked during controlled maintenance
    periods or server initialization phases.
