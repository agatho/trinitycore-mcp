  signature: void QuestStrategy::SearchForQuestGivers(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Searches for quest givers within the bot's current area and updates the AI's
    quest giver list.
  description: The SearchForQuestGivers method scans the bot's current zone or area
    to identify and collect all available quest givers. It iterates through the game
    world entities, filtering for NPCs that can provide quests, and updates an internal
    list within the BotAI context. This method is typically invoked during questing
    behavior to ensure the AI has up-to-date information about nearby quest providers.
    The method does not return any value but modifies the state of the provided BotAI
    instance by populating its quest giver cache.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Questing AI
    code: "void MyQuestStrategy::Update(BotAI* ai)\n{\n    SearchForQuestGivers(ai);\n\
      \    // Proceed with quest selection logic using updated quest givers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core questing AI system and should be called regularly
    to maintain an accurate list of available quest givers. It relies on the underlying
    WorldObject scanning mechanisms and may have performance implications in densely
    populated areas with many NPCs.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid BotAI instance can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the AI context is properly initialized before
    invoking this function.
