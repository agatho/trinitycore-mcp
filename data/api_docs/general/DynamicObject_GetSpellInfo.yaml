  class: DynamicObject
  method: GetSpellInfo
  signature: const SpellInfo * DynamicObject::GetSpellInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the SpellInfo structure associated with the dynamic object's spell.
  description: The GetSpellInfo method returns a pointer to the SpellInfo structure
    that defines the properties and behavior of the spell responsible for creating
    this dynamic object. This information includes spell effects, duration, range,
    targets, and other core spell mechanics. The returned pointer is const, ensuring
    that the spell data cannot be modified through this interface. Dynamic objects
    are typically created by spells such as area-of-effect abilities or summoning
    spells, and this method allows access to the defining characteristics of those
    spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the SpellInfo structure representing the spell that
    created this dynamic object. Returns nullptr if the dynamic object was not created
    by a valid spell or if the spell information is unavailable.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing spell info for damage calculation
    code: "const SpellInfo* spellInfo = dynamicObject->GetSpellInfo();\nif (spellInfo)\n\
      {\n    uint32 spellId = spellInfo->Id;\n    int32 baseDamage = spellInfo->Effects[0].BasePoints;\n\
      \    // Use spell info for further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if dynamic object was created by a specific spell
    code: "const SpellInfo* spellInfo = dynamicObject->GetSpellInfo();\nif (spellInfo\
      \ && spellInfo->Id == 12345)\n{\n    // Handle special logic for this spell\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in spell effect handlers and AI systems to
    determine how a dynamic object should behave based on its originating spell. The
    SpellInfo pointer returned is valid only as long as the dynamic object exists,
    and the spell data remains loaded in memory.
  warnings: Do not modify the SpellInfo structure through the returned pointer as
    it's const. Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths
    since accessing spell information may involve lookups in internal databases.
