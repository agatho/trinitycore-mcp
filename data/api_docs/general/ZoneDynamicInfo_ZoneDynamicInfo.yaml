documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ZoneDynamicInfo class with default values.
  description: The ZoneDynamicInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the ZoneDynamicInfo
    class, setting up internal data structures and default state values. This method
    is typically called when creating a new dynamic zone information object, which
    may be used to track real-time changes in zone-specific game data such as player
    counts, event states, or dynamic spawn information within a specific zone. The
    constructor ensures that all member variables are properly initialized to their
    default states before the object is used in gameplay logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ZoneDynamicInfo instance
    code: 'ZoneDynamicInfo zoneInfo;

      // zoneInfo is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked automatically when declaring a ZoneDynamicInfo
    variable on the stack. Developers should be aware that this constructor does not
    perform any network communication or external data loading - it only sets up internal
    state. The actual zone data population usually occurs through other methods or
    during server initialization.
