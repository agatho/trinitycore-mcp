  signature: uint32 GameObjectTemplate::GetConditionID1() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the first condition ID associated with the game object template.
  description: The GetConditionID1 method returns the condition identifier (ID) that
    is used to determine whether the game object template should be displayed or interacted
    with based on specific in-game conditions. This ID typically references entries
    in the Condition table within the database, allowing for dynamic visibility or
    usability of game objects depending on player state, quest progress, or other
    environmental factors. The method does not perform any validation or processing;
    it simply returns the stored condition ID value from the object's internal data
    structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the condition ID associated with this game
    object template. If no condition is set, this value will typically be 0, indicating
    that the object has no conditional requirements for display or interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Condition ID
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      uint32 conditionId = goTemplate->GetConditionID1();\nif (conditionId != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Object has a condition, check it\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"condition\",\
      \ \"GameObject %u has condition ID: %u\", goTemplate->entry, conditionId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Condition ID in Conditional Logic
    code: "uint32 conditionId = goTemplate->GetConditionID1();\nif (conditionId >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Check if the player meets the condition\n    if (sConditionMgr->IsPlayerMeetingCondition(player,\
      \ conditionId))\n    {\n        // Allow interaction or display\n        go->SetGoState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Hide or disable interaction\n        go->SetGoState(GO_STATE_READY);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not involve any database lookups
    or complex logic. It directly accesses the internal stored value of the condition
    ID, which is typically populated during server startup when loading game object
    templates from the database.
  warnings: Be aware that a returned value of 0 does not necessarily mean the object
    has no conditions; it could indicate that the condition was not properly set or
    loaded. Always validate the returned condition ID against known valid entries
    in the Condition table to avoid unexpected behavior.
