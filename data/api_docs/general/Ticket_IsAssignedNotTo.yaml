documentation:
  brief: Checks if the ticket is not assigned to a specific player GUID
  description: This method determines whether the current ticket is currently assigned
    to a different player than the one specified by the provided GUID. It is commonly
    used in the ticketing system to verify assignment status before performing operations
    such as transferring or resolving tickets. The method performs a comparison against
    the internal assigned GUID of the ticket and returns true if they do not match,
    indicating that the ticket is not assigned to the specified player.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check against.
      This represents the unique ID of a specific player in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the ticket is assigned to a different player than the one
    specified by the GUID, or if the ticket has no assignment. Returns false if the
    ticket is currently assigned to the specified player GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Check if ticket is not assigned to a specific player
    code: "if (ticket->IsAssignedNotTo(playerGuid)) {\n    // Ticket is not assigned\
      \ to this player\n    // Proceed with assignment logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in ticket management system
    code: "void HandleTicketAssignment(Ticket* ticket, uint32 newPlayerGuid) {\n \
      \   if (ticket->IsAssignedNotTo(newPlayerGuid)) {\n        // Transfer ticket\
      \ to the new player\n        ticket->SetAssignedTo(newPlayerGuid);\n       \
      \ sWorld->SendGMText(LANG_TICKET_ASSIGN, ticket->GetId(), newPlayerGuid);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Ticket already assigned to this player\n        sWorld->SendGMText(LANG_TICKET_ALREADY_ASSIGNED,\
      \ ticket->GetId(), newPlayerGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other ticket management
    functions to ensure proper assignment handling. It does not modify the ticket's
    state but only performs a read-only check. The implementation likely uses an internal
    member variable to store the assigned GUID.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID is valid and corresponds to an actual player
    in the game world, as invalid GUIDs may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect
    results.
