documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for beast mastery hunter abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown states of various hunter abilities that are part of the Beast Mastery
    specialization. This method is typically called during each update cycle to decrement
    active cooldown timers and handle the logic required when abilities become available
    again. It ensures proper timing and prevents players from using abilities before
    their cooldown periods have expired, which is a core game mechanic in World of
    Warcraft's combat system.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        if (BeastMasteryHunter*\
      \ hunter = dynamic_cast<BeastMasteryHunter*>(player->GetPlayerClass()))\n  \
      \      {\n            hunter->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n        }\n    }\n   \
      \ // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked from the main game loop or update cycle, typically
    with a time delta parameter (diff) that represents milliseconds since last update.
    The implementation likely uses internal tracking of cooldown timers and may interact
    with the player's ability system to manage state transitions.
