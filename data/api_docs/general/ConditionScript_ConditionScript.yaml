  method: ConditionScript
  signature: void ConditionScript::ConditionScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ConditionScript with the specified name for conditional evaluation
    in TrinityCore.
  description: The ConditionScript constructor initializes a condition script instance
    with a given name. This method is used to register and set up conditional logic
    within the TrinityCore framework, typically for use in game events, quests, or
    AI behaviors where certain conditions must be evaluated before executing actions.
    The name parameter serves as an identifier for the condition script, allowing
    it to be referenced later during runtime evaluation. This constructor is part
    of the broader condition system that enables dynamic gameplay behavior based on
    configurable criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated character string that serves as the unique identifier
      for this condition script instance. The name should be descriptive and unique
      within the context of the game's condition system to avoid conflicts or ambiguity
      during evaluation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ConditionScript Initialization
    code: "class MyConditionScript : public ConditionScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyConditionScript()\
      \ : ConditionScript(\"MyCustomCondition\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Quest Condition Context
    code: "class QuestConditionScript : public ConditionScript\n{\npublic:\n    QuestConditionScript()\
      \ : ConditionScript(\"PlayerHasRequiredItems\")\n    {\n        // Additional\
      \ initialization logic can go here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called as part of a class derivation from ConditionScript.
    Developers should ensure that the name parameter is unique and descriptive to
    prevent conflicts in condition evaluation. The actual condition evaluation logic
    must be implemented in derived classes by overriding virtual methods.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly with invalid or null names, as it
    may lead to undefined behavior during condition evaluation. Always derive from
    ConditionScript when implementing custom conditions.
