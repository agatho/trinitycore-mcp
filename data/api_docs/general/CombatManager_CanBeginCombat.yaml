  class: CombatManager
  method: CanBeginCombat
  signature: bool CombatManager::CanBeginCombat(const Unit * a, const Unit * b)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether two units can enter combat with each other based on game
    rules and conditions.
  description: The CanBeginCombat method evaluates whether two Unit objects are eligible
    to initiate combat. This check typically considers factors such as faction neutrality,
    PvP status, aggro rules, and game server settings. It is used internally by the
    combat system to prevent invalid or unintended combat scenarios. The method returns
    true if the units can begin combat, and false otherwise. This function plays a
    critical role in maintaining proper game mechanics and preventing exploits related
    to forced combat initiation.
  parameters:
  - name: a
    description: Pointer to the first Unit involved in potential combat. Must not
      be null.
  - name: b
    description: Pointer to the second Unit involved in potential combat. Must not
      be null.
  returns: True if both units can begin combat with each other according to game rules;
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Initiation Check
    code: "if (combatManager->CanBeginCombat(player, mob)) {\n    player->Attack(mob);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Preventing Invalid Combat Scenarios
    code: "if (!combatManager->CanBeginCombat(npc1, npc2)) {\n    // Prevent combat\
      \ between these NPCs\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with combat logic\nnpc1->Engage(npc2);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform checks against faction relationships, PvP flags,
    and server-side combat restrictions. It is typically called before initiating
    combat to avoid invalid states. The implementation might also consider stealth
    status, invisibility, and other game-specific conditions that affect combat eligibility.
  warnings: Ensure both Unit pointers are valid before calling this method to prevent
    crashes. This function does not directly initiate combat; it only determines if
    combat can begin. Calling this method inappropriately may lead to incorrect combat
    behavior or exploits.
