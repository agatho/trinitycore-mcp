  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: CoordinateInterrupts
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::CoordinateInterrupts(Group * group, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates interrupt handling for group members during dungeon encounters.
  description: The CoordinateInterrupts method manages and synchronizes interrupt
    behaviors among group members during dungeon encounters. It ensures that interrupts
    are properly handled across all players in the group, preventing conflicts or
    missed interrupts during combat scenarios. This method is typically invoked when
    a target unit is interrupted by an ability or spell, and it coordinates the necessary
    actions for all group members to respond appropriately. The method handles synchronization
    of interrupt states, cooldowns, and potential interrupt animations or effects
    across the entire group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the dungeon group. Must
      be a valid group with active members.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being interrupted. Must be a valid
      unit in the current dungeon encounter context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic interrupt coordination for group members
    code: "void HandleDungeonInterrupt(Group* group, Unit* target)\n{\n    if (group\
      \ && target)\n    {\n        DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;\n        dungeonBehavior.CoordinateInterrupts(group,\
      \ target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupt coordination with error checking
    code: "void ProcessInterrupt(Group* group, Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!group ||\
      \ !target)\n        return;\n\n    // Ensure group has valid members\n    if\
      \ (group->GetMembersCount() == 0)\n        return;\n\n    DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;\n\
      \    dungeonBehavior.CoordinateInterrupts(group, target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and target parameters are valid and properly
    initialized. The method may perform synchronization operations that could impact
    performance if called frequently during high-interrupt scenarios. It's designed
    to work within the context of dungeon encounters where group coordination is essential
    for proper gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Calling this method with null or invalid group/target pointers will likely
    result in undefined behavior. Ensure that all group members are properly initialized
    and that the target unit exists in the current encounter before calling this method.
