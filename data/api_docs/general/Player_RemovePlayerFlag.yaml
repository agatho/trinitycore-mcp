documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified player flag from the player's flags list
  description: The RemovePlayerFlag method removes a specific PlayerFlags enum value
    from the player's current flags list. This method is used to strip away certain
    player status flags that may affect gameplay mechanics, such as PvP flag status,
    ghost state, or other special conditions. The operation affects the player's internal
    state and can influence how the game handles player interactions, combat, and
    visibility. It is typically used in scenarios where a player needs to be stripped
    of specific status flags, such as when transitioning from PvP to PvE gameplay
    or when resetting player states after certain events.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The PlayerFlags enum value to remove from the player's flags list.
      This parameter specifies which flag to remove, and can include various status
      flags such as PVP_FLAG, GHOST_FLAG, or other player-related flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove PvP Flag
    code: player->RemovePlayerFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS_PVP_FLAG);
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Multiple Flags
    code: player->RemovePlayerFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS_GHOST_FLAG | PLAYER_FLAGS_PVP_FLAG);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AddPlayerFlag to manage
    player status flags. The implementation involves updating the internal player
    flags bitmask and may involve synchronization with the client's state. Performance
    considerations are minimal, but care should be taken when removing multiple flags
    at once to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect player state handling,
    especially in PvP scenarios where flag removal affects combat behavior. Be cautious
    when removing flags that may impact visibility or combat status, as these changes
    may not be immediately visible to other players.
