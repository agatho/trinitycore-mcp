documentation:
  brief: Applies power burn effect to target, reducing their mana and transferring
    it to the caster.
  description: The EffectPowerBurn method implements a spell effect that drains mana
    from the target and transfers it to the caster. This is commonly used in spells
    like Soul Leech or similar mana drain mechanics where the caster gains mana proportional
    to the amount drained from the target. The method operates within the context
    of spell mechanics and can be triggered by various spell effects that require
    mana transfer. It typically involves checking if the target has sufficient mana
    to drain, then performing the transfer operation.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell effect system and requires proper handling
    of mana calculations. It should be used in conjunction with other spell effects
    that require mana transfer or drain operations.
  warnings: This method may cause issues if not properly implemented, especially when
    dealing with target mana values. Improper handling can lead to incorrect mana
    calculations or even crashes if the target has no mana to drain.
