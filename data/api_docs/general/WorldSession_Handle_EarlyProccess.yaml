documentation:
  brief: Processes early session initialization tasks for a WorldSession object.
  description: The Handle_EarlyProccess method is responsible for performing initial
    setup and validation operations during the early stages of a WorldSession lifecycle.
    This method typically handles essential session state management, authentication
    checks, and prepares the session for further processing. It serves as a critical
    entry point in the session handling pipeline where fundamental session properties
    are verified and initialized before more complex operations begin. The method
    is usually invoked during the connection establishment phase to ensure that the
    session meets basic requirements before proceeding with player data loading or
    game state initialization.

  returns: null

    code: "void WorldSession::Handle_EarlyProccess(WorldPackets::Null& null)\n{\n\
      \    // Perform early session validation\n    if (!IsAuthenticated())\n    {\n\
      \        // Handle unauthenticated session\n        return;\n    }\n    \n \
      \   // Initialize basic session properties\n    SetPlayer(nullptr);\n    SetSecurity(SEC_PLAYER);\n\
      \    \n    // Log session start\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_NETWORKIO, \"\
      Early processing completed for session %u\", GetAccountId());\n}"

  notes: This method is typically called during the initial connection handshake and
    should be lightweight to avoid blocking network operations. It's important to
    note that this method may be invoked multiple times during a session's lifetime,
    particularly when handling reconnections or session resets. The method assumes
    that basic network connectivity has already been established.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method can lead to session initialization
    failures or security vulnerabilities. Developers should ensure that all authentication
    checks are performed before proceeding with any session-specific operations. Avoid
    performing heavy computations in this method as it may block the network thread
    and impact overall server performance.
