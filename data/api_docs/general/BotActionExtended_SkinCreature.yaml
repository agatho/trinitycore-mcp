  class: BotActionExtended
  method: SkinCreature
  signature: BotActionExtended BotActionExtended::SkinCreature(int bot, int creature,
    uint32 spellId, uint32 skillRequired, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the skinning process for a creature by a bot using a specified
    spell and skill requirement.
  description: The SkinCreature method is used to instruct a bot to skin a creature
    in World of Warcraft using the TrinityCore framework. This action requires the
    bot to have sufficient skill level and to possess the appropriate spell. The method
    creates and returns a BotActionExtended object that represents this skinning action,
    which can then be queued or executed by the bot's AI system. The timestamp parameter
    allows for tracking when the action was initiated, which may be used for cooldowns
    or logging purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The identifier of the bot that will perform the skinning action.
  - name: creature
    description: The identifier of the creature to be skinned.
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID required to perform the skinning action, typically a
      skinning spell such as 3908. Must correspond to a valid skinning spell in the
      game.
  - name: skillRequired
    description: The minimum skill level required for the bot to successfully skin
      the creature. This value is used to validate if the bot has sufficient skill.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A Unix timestamp indicating when the skinning action was initiated,
      useful for tracking and cooldown management.
  returns: Returns a BotActionExtended object representing the skinning action that
    can be added to the bot's action queue or executed immediately.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SkinCreature
    code: 'BotActionExtended action = SkinCreature(12345, 67890, 3908, 150, time(nullptr));

      // Adds the skinning action to the bot''s queue

      bot->AddAction(action);'
    language: cpp
  - title: SkinCreature with skill validation
    code: "uint32 requiredSkill = 200;\nuint32 spellId = 3908;\nint botId = 12345;\n\
      int creatureId = 67890;\nuint32 currentTime = time(nullptr);\n\nif (GetBotSkill(botId)\
      \ >= requiredSkill)\n{\n    BotActionExtended action = SkinCreature(botId, creatureId,\
      \ spellId, requiredSkill, currentTime);\n    bot->AddAction(action);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle insufficient skill case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has already been initialized and is capable
    of performing actions. The spell ID must be a valid skinning spell in the game's
    database, otherwise the action may fail silently or cause an error. Timestamps
    are important for managing cooldowns and ensuring that actions are not duplicated
    or performed too frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot has sufficient skill level before calling this method;
    otherwise, the skinning will likely fail. Also, be cautious with using hardcoded
    spell IDs unless you're certain of their validity in your specific game version
    or patch.
