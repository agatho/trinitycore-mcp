  class: KitingManager
  method: AdjustKitingForTerrain
  signature: int KitingManager::AdjustKitingForTerrain(const int & intended)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the kiting behavior based on terrain properties to optimize player
    movement.
  description: The AdjustKitingForTerrain method modifies the intended kiting direction
    or speed based on the current terrain characteristics such as elevation changes,
    slope angles, and obstacle proximity. This ensures that player movement remains
    natural and effective during kiting scenarios, particularly when navigating complex
    landscapes like hills, cliffs, or urban environments. The method evaluates the
    terrain data around the player's position and adjusts the kiting parameters accordingly
    to prevent unrealistic movement patterns or clipping issues.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an adjusted integer value representing the modified kiting parameter
    (such as direction angle or speed modifier) that accounts for terrain influences.
    A positive return indicates an increase in kiting effectiveness, while a negative
    value suggests a reduction or adjustment to avoid terrain conflicts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Kiting Logic
    code: "int adjustedKiting = kitingManager.AdjustKitingForTerrain(intendedDirection);\n\
      if (adjustedKiting > 0) {\n    player->SetFacing(adjustedKiting);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Update Loop
    code: "void Player::UpdateKitingMovement() {\n    int baseKiting = GetIntendedKitingDirection();\n\
      \    int adjusted = kitingManager.AdjustKitingForTerrain(baseKiting);\n    MovePlayer(adjusted);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during movement updates or kiting state transitions.
    It may perform terrain sampling operations which could introduce slight performance
    overhead depending on the complexity of the surrounding environment. The adjustment
    logic is designed to be non-blocking and should not significantly impact real-time
    gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the intended parameter passed to this method is within valid
    range before calling, as invalid values might lead to unexpected adjustments or
    movement artifacts. This method assumes terrain data is already available and
    properly initialized in the KitingManager context.
