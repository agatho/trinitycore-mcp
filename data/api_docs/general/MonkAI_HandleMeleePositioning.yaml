  class: MonkAI
  method: HandleMeleePositioning
  signature: void MonkAI::HandleMeleePositioning(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the monk's melee positioning based on target distance and combat
    requirements.
  description: The HandleMeleePositioning method manages the AI behavior for a monk
    character in close combat, determining optimal positioning relative to the target.
    It evaluates the distance between the monk and its target, adjusting movement
    patterns to maintain effective melee range while considering factors such as attack
    cooldowns, stance requirements, and environmental constraints. This method is
    typically invoked during the AI update cycle to ensure proper tactical positioning
    during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position
      index. Used to determine relative positioning and movement adjustments.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        HandleMeleePositioning(&targetId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the monk is in a combat state and has an active
    target. The positioning logic may vary depending on the monk's current stance
    (e.g., Tiger Stance, Bear Stance) and available abilities. Performance is optimized
    for frequent calls during AI update cycles.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid unit before calling
    this method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    This method should not be called outside of combat situations where positioning
    is relevant.
