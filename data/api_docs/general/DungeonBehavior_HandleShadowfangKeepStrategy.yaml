  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: HandleShadowfangKeepStrategy
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleShadowfangKeepStrategy(Group * group, uint32
    encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the Shadowfang Keep dungeon strategy for a given group and encounter
    ID.
  description: The HandleShadowfangKeepStrategy method manages the AI behavior and
    encounter handling logic specific to the Shadowfang Keep dungeon instance. This
    method is responsible for coordinating group activities, managing encounter states,
    and executing strategic decisions based on the current encounter ID and group
    composition. It integrates with TrinityCore's dungeon AI system to ensure proper
    execution of dungeon mechanics, loot distribution, and player progression through
    the various encounters within Shadowfang Keep.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group participating
      in the Shadowfang Keep dungeon. This parameter contains information about group
      members, their roles, and current status.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the current dungeon encounter being processed.
      This value determines which specific encounter logic should be executed within
      the Shadowfang Keep instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter handling
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, uint32 encounterId)\n\
      {\n    HandleShadowfangKeepStrategy(group, encounterId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom dungeon AI system
    code: "class ShadowfangDungeonAI : public DungeonBehavior\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ ProcessEncounter(Group* group, uint32 encounterId) override\n    {\n     \
      \   if (encounterId == ENCOUNTER_WOLF_MASTER_NANDOS)\n        {\n          \
      \  // Custom logic for Wolf Master Nandos encounter\n            HandleShadowfangKeepStrategy(group,\
      \ encounterId);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            HandleShadowfangKeepStrategy(group,\
      \ encounterId);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's dungeon AI framework and should be called
    from within the appropriate encounter handling context. The method assumes that
    the group has been properly initialized with valid player data and that the encounterId
    corresponds to a known Shadowfang Keep encounter. Implementation details may vary
    based on the specific version of TrinityCore being used.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior. The encounterId
    parameter must correspond to a valid encounter within Shadowfang Keep; otherwise,
    the method may not behave as expected or could cause errors during dungeon progression.
