  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::EndPerformanceTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Ends a performance timer previously started by StartPerformanceTimer.
  description: The EndPerformanceTimer method is used to stop and record the duration
    of a performance measurement that was initiated with the StartPerformanceTimer
    method. This functionality is typically employed within AI behavior systems to
    monitor execution times of specific actions or sequences, aiding in debugging
    and optimization of NPC behaviors. The method does not take any parameters and
    does not return a value. It relies on an internal timer mechanism that must have
    been initialized by a prior call to StartPerformanceTimer.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Behavior AI
    code: "class MyAI : public AdvancedBehaviorManager {\npublic:\n    void ExecuteAction()\
      \ {\n        StartPerformanceTimer();\n        // Some behavior logic here\n\
      \        EndPerformanceTimer();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a performance timer has been started using StartPerformanceTimer.
    Calling EndPerformanceTimer without a corresponding StartPerformanceTimer may
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect timing measurements.
