documentation:
  brief: Updates the specified unit modifier value based on current state and modifiers.
  description: The UpdateUnitMod method recalculates and applies any active modifiers
    to a specific unit modifier type. This method is typically called internally by
    the game engine when unit stats, such as health, mana, or damage, are modified
    through buffs, debuffs, equipment changes, or other gameplay events. It ensures
    that all calculated values reflect the most up-to-date state of the unit's modifiers.
    The method operates on a predefined set of unit modifier types defined in the
    UnitMods enumeration, and it updates internal cached values for performance reasons.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating a unit's attack power modifier
    code: 'Unit* player = ...;

      player->UpdateUnitMod(UNIT_MOD_ATTACK_POWER);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the core when modifiers change,
    but may also be called manually in special circumstances. It's important to understand
    that this function does not directly modify the base value of a unit modifier;
    instead, it recalculates the final effective value based on all active modifiers.
