  class: BotActionProcessor
  method: ExecuteFollowTarget
  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteFollowTarget(Player * bot,
    const BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the bot's follow target action, causing the bot to move and follow
    a specified target unit.
  description: The ExecuteFollowTarget method is responsible for processing a bot's
    command to follow a designated target unit. It handles the logic required to make
    the bot move toward and maintain proximity to the target. This includes calculating
    movement paths, managing combat states, and ensuring the bot remains engaged with
    the target in a manner consistent with bot behavior rules. The method typically
    operates within the context of a bot's action queue and is invoked when a 'follow'
    command is issued to the bot. It ensures that the bot's movement aligns with game
    mechanics such as line of sight, pathfinding, and avoidance of obstacles.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the follow action.
  - name: action
    description: Reference to a BotAction object containing the parameters and configuration
      for the follow command, including target unit information.
  returns: Returns a BotActionResult indicating whether the follow action was successfully
    initiated or if an error occurred. The result may include success status, failure
    reason, or additional metadata about the execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Follow Target Usage
    code: "BotAction action;\naction.type = BOT_ACTION_FOLLOW;\naction.targetGuid\
      \ = targetUnit->GetGUID();\nBotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteFollowTarget(bot,\
      \ action);\nif (result.success) {\n    // Bot is now following the target\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Follow Result
    code: "BotAction action;\naction.type = BOT_ACTION_FOLLOW;\naction.targetGuid\
      \ = targetUnit->GetGUID();\nBotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteFollowTarget(bot,\
      \ action);\nif (!result.success) {\n    // Log error or handle failure\n   \
      \ sLog->outError(\"Failed to execute follow target for bot %s: %s\", bot->GetName().c_str(),\
      \ result.error.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target unit is valid and accessible. It relies
    on the bot's AI subsystem to manage movement and positioning. The implementation
    may involve pathfinding, collision detection, and state management for the bot.
    Performance considerations include avoiding frequent re-calculation of paths if
    the target is stationary.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is not null or invalid before calling this
    method. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be
    cautious when using this action in environments with high player density or complex
    terrain where pathfinding might fail.
