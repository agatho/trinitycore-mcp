  class: RestorationHoTTracker
  method: ApplyWildGrowth
  signature: void RestorationHoTTracker::ApplyWildGrowth(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a Wild Growth heal-over-time effect to the specified target with
    the given duration.
  description: The ApplyWildGrowth method is used in the RestorationHoTTracker class
    to initiate or refresh a Wild Growth heal-over-time effect on a target unit. This
    method takes a GUID identifying the target and a duration value, which determines
    how long the HoT will persist. The implementation likely manages internal tracking
    of active HoTs, updates the target's aura state, and schedules periodic healing
    events. It is typically invoked during spell casting or aura application logic
    within the TrinityCore framework for Druid Restoration spec gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to apply the Wild
      Growth HoT effect to. This should be a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player
      GUID.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Wild Growth HoT will remain
      active on the target. This value determines how long the periodic healing will
      occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 targetGuid = player->GetGUID().GetRawValue();

      restorationHOTTracker->ApplyWildGrowth(targetGuid, 15000); // Apply for 15 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Duration
    code: 'uint32 duration = 10000 + (spellLevel * 2000); // Base 10s + 2s per spell
      level

      restorationHOTTracker->ApplyWildGrowth(targetGuid, duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the core aura system to manage HoT effects.
    It may also update internal tracking structures such as a map or list of active
    HoTs per target. The actual healing ticks are probably handled separately by the
    aura tick handler mechanism in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed is valid and refers to an existing unit before
    calling this method, otherwise behavior is undefined. Duration values should be
    within reasonable bounds to prevent excessive memory or performance impact from
    long-running HoTs.
