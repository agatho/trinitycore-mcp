  method: GameObjectCellRelocation
  signature: bool Map::GameObjectCellRelocation(GameObject * go, int new_cell)
documentation:
  brief: Relocates a game object to a new cell within the map.
  description: The GameObjectCellRelocation method handles the process of moving a
    GameObject from its current cell to a new cell on the map. This is typically invoked
    when a game object's position changes significantly enough to cross cell boundaries.
    The method updates internal tracking structures and ensures that the object is
    properly registered in the new cell's data structures. It plays a crucial role
    in maintaining the integrity of the spatial partitioning system used by the TrinityCore
    server for efficient object management and visibility calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the GameObject instance that needs to be relocated. Must
      not be null.
  - name: new_cell
    description: The identifier of the new cell where the game object should be moved.
      This represents a grid cell coordinate within the map's spatial partitioning
      system.
  returns: Returns true if the relocation was successful and the object was properly
    moved to the new cell; returns false if the operation failed, which may occur
    due to invalid parameters or internal errors during the relocation process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic GameObject Relocation
    code: "GameObject* go = ...; // Get a valid GameObject\nint newCellId = 12345;\
      \ // New cell identifier\nbool success = map->GameObjectCellRelocation(go, newCellId);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Object successfully relocated\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ relocation failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Relocation with Error Handling
    code: "GameObject* go = player->GetGameObject();\nif (!go) return;\n\nint newCellId\
      \ = CalculateNewCell(go->GetPosition());\nif (newCellId < 0) {\n    // Invalid\
      \ cell ID\n    return;\n}\n\nbool result = map->GameObjectCellRelocation(go,\
      \ newCellId);\nif (!result) {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to relocate GameObject\
      \ %u\", go->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal map management system and should typically
    be called automatically by the core engine when object positions change. Developers
    should not generally need to call this directly unless implementing custom movement
    or positioning logic. The method assumes that the GameObject's new position has
    already been updated in its internal data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GameObject pointer or an invalid cell
    ID can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the GameObject is valid
    and the new cell ID corresponds to a legitimate cell within the map's grid system
    before invoking this method.
