documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's local chat channels based on their current zone
  description: The UpdateLocalChannels method manages the player's chat channel subscriptions
    and visibility based on their current zone. It ensures that players automatically
    join or leave zone-specific channels when they move between different areas of
    Azeroth. This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a
    player changes zones, but can also be invoked manually to synchronize channel
    states. The method handles both joining new zone channels and leaving old ones
    based on the player's location.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Manual Zone Channel Update
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      // Manually update channel subscriptions for a specific zone

      player->UpdateLocalChannels(1234); // Update for zone ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Zone Change Handler Integration
    code: "void Player::OnZoneChange(uint32 newZoneId)\n{\n    // Perform standard\
      \ zone change logic\n    UpdateLastZone(newZoneId);\n    \n    // Update local\
      \ channels for the new zone\n    UpdateLocalChannels(newZoneId);\n    \n   \
      \ // Notify other systems of zone change\n    SendZoneChangeMessage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    zone transitions. It modifies the player's internal channel subscription state
    and may trigger network messages to update client-side channel visibility. The
    method does not directly handle global or guild channels, focusing only on local
    zone-specific channels.
  warnings: Calling this method manually without proper zone context may result in
    incorrect channel subscriptions. The method assumes that the player's current
    zone has been properly updated before execution. Avoid calling this during critical
    gameplay operations where channel state consistency is important.
