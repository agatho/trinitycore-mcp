  brief: Finalizes and processes all queued bot packet messages in the simulation
    queue
  description: The SimulateQueuedMessagesEnd method is responsible for completing
    the processing of all pending bot packet messages that have been added to the
    simulation queue. This method typically flushes the queue, executes any deferred
    operations, and ensures that all queued packets are properly handled within the
    game's networking simulation framework. It serves as a synchronization point for
    bot packet handling, ensuring that no messages are left unprocessed when transitioning
    between different simulation states or when ending a batch of packet operations.
    The method is commonly called at the end of a bot communication sequence to guarantee
    all simulated messages are delivered and processed correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Simulation
    code: 'BotPacketSimulator simulator;

      // ... queue some bot packets ...

      simulator.SimulateQueuedMessagesEnd(); // Finalize all queued messages'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after all desired bot packets have been
    queued. It is typically used in conjunction with SimulateQueuedMessagesBegin()
    to create a complete simulation cycle. The method may internally trigger packet
    delivery events and update internal state tracking for the bot's network activity.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior calls to SimulateQueuedMessagesBegin()
    or without queuing messages may result in undefined behavior or empty queue processing.
    Ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
