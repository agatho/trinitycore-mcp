  class: LootCoordination
  method: HandleCrossInstanceLootSharing
  signature: void LootCoordination::HandleCrossInstanceLootSharing(Group * sourceGroup,
    Group * targetGroup, const LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the coordination of loot sharing between groups across different
    instances in World of Warcraft.
  description: The HandleCrossInstanceLootSharing method manages the distribution
    and coordination of loot items between two groups that may be in different instance
    zones. This functionality is crucial for maintaining fair loot distribution when
    players from different instances are part of the same raid or group. The method
    ensures proper loot assignment, handles cross-instance loot sharing rules, and
    coordinates with the loot coordination system to prevent conflicts or duplicate
    loot assignments. It typically operates within the context of group loot systems
    where items are awarded to specific group members based on loot rules such as
    need/greed or round-robin distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: sourceGroup
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that originally
      generated or owns the loot item. This group may be in a different instance than
      the target group.
  - name: targetGroup
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that will receive
      or coordinate the loot item. This group may be in the same or different instance
      as the source group.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to a LootItem structure containing information about the
      specific loot item being coordinated, including item ID, stack size, and other
      loot properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cross-Instance Loot Coordination
    code: 'Group* source = player1->GetGroup();

      Group* target = player2->GetGroup();

      LootItem lootItem;

      lootItem.itemID = 12345;

      lootItem.count = 1;


      // Coordinate loot sharing between groups in different instances

      LootCoordination::HandleCrossInstanceLootSharing(source, target, lootItem);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Loot Sharing with Instance Group Validation
    code: "if (sourceGroup && targetGroup && sourceGroup != targetGroup)\n{\n    //\
      \ Ensure groups are valid and different\n    if (sourceGroup->IsInInstance()\
      \ != targetGroup->IsInInstance())\n    {\n        LootCoordination::HandleCrossInstanceLootSharing(sourceGroup,\
      \ targetGroup, item);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during loot distribution when cross-instance
    groups need to coordinate loot sharing. The implementation may involve checking
    group membership, instance status, and loot rules to ensure proper coordination.
    It's important to note that this method assumes both groups are valid and properly
    initialized before calling.
  warnings: Improper handling of group pointers or instance states can lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect loot distribution. Always verify that sourceGroup and targetGroup
    are not null and represent valid groups before calling this method.
