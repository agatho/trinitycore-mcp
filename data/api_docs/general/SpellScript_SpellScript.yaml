  brief: Initializes a new SpellScript instance with default values and prepares internal
    state for spell script execution.
  description: The SpellScript constructor initializes a new instance of the SpellScript
    class, setting up default member variables and preparing the object for use in
    spell script execution. This constructor is typically called when creating custom
    spell scripts that inherit from the base SpellScript class. It ensures that all
    internal state variables are properly initialized before the spell script is executed
    by the TrinityCore server. The constructor does not accept any parameters, as
    it's designed to be a default constructor for initializing the spell script framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SpellScript Initialization
    code: "class MyCustomSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyCustomSpellScript()\
      \ : SpellScript() {}\n    // Custom spell script implementation\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Inheriting from SpellScript
    code: "class FireballSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    FireballSpellScript()\
      \ : SpellScript()\n    {\n        // Additional initialization if needed\n \
      \   }\n    \n    void HandleHit() override\n    {\n        // Custom hit handling\
      \ logic\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The SpellScript constructor is automatically called when a spell script object
    is instantiated. Developers should not manually call this constructor in their
    code, as it's part of the internal framework. The constructor sets up necessary
    internal state but does not perform any spell-specific initialization that would
    require parameters.
