  class: RoleAssignment
  method: OptimizeForRaid
  signature: void RoleAssignment::OptimizeForRaid(Group * group, uint32 raidId)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes role assignments for a raid group based on player roles and class
    distributions.
  description: 'The OptimizeForRaid method adjusts role assignments within a specified
    raid group to ensure optimal distribution of tank, healer, and damage dealer roles.
    It analyzes the composition of players in the group, considering their classes
    and existing role assignments, and redistributes roles to maximize raid efficiency.
    This method is typically invoked when a raid is formed or when significant changes
    occur in group composition. The optimization process considers class-specific
    role requirements (e.g., certain classes are better suited for tanks or healers)
    and attempts to balance the group''s overall capabilities. Precondition: The provided
    group must be a valid raid group with at least one member. Postcondition: Role
    assignments within the group are updated to reflect an optimized configuration.'
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the raid group to optimize.
      Must not be null and should represent a valid raid group with members.
  - name: raidId
    description: Unique identifier for the raid instance. Used to track which specific
      raid this optimization applies to. Should be a positive integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeForRaid
    code: "Group* raidGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(raidId);\nif (raidGroup && raidGroup->isRaidGroup())\n\
      {\n    RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.OptimizeForRaid(raidGroup,\
      \ raidId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of role assignments within the group.
    It is recommended to call this method after significant changes in group composition
    or when forming new raids. The optimization algorithm prioritizes class-based
    role matching and attempts to maintain balanced roles across the raid.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-raid group may result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the group is properly initialized as a raid before invoking this function.
    Additionally, frequent calls to this method during active raid encounters might
    cause performance issues due to recalculating role assignments.
