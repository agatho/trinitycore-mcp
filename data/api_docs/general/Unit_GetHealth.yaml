  signature: uint64 Unit::GetHealth() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current health value of the unit.
  description: The GetHealth method retrieves the current health points of a Unit
    object, which represents any entity in the game world such as players, NPCs, or
    pets. This value is typically used for determining whether an entity is alive
    or dead, and can be compared against maximum health to calculate health percentages.
    The method returns a uint64 value representing the health points, which may be
    zero for dead entities or a positive number for living ones. This method is commonly
    used in game logic calculations and combat systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the current health points of the unit.
    A value of 0 indicates that the unit is dead, while any positive value represents
    the current health status of the entity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Health Check
    code: "if (unit->GetHealth() > 0)\n{\n    // Unit is alive\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Unit is dead\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Health Percentage Calculation
    code: "uint64 currentHealth = unit->GetHealth();\nuint64 maxHealth = unit->GetMaxHealth();\n\
      float healthPercentage = (float)currentHealth / (float)maxHealth * 100.0f;\n\
      if (healthPercentage > 0)\n{\n    // Calculate health percentage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it simply returns a stored value without complex
    calculations or memory allocations.
  warnings: The method should not be used for checking if an entity is alive in combat
    situations, as it does not account for the presence of temporary effects that
    may alter health status. Always ensure to check against maximum health values
    when calculating percentages.
