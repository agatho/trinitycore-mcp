  class: TransportBase
  method: AddPassenger
  signature: void TransportBase::AddPassenger(WorldObject * passenger, const int &
    offset)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a passenger to the transport at the specified offset position.
  description: The AddPassenger method is used to register a WorldObject (typically
    a player or creature) as a passenger on a TransportBase object. This method assigns
    the passenger to a specific offset position on the transport, which determines
    their relative location and movement behavior. The offset parameter controls where
    on the transport the passenger will be placed. This functionality is essential
    for implementing transports such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving objects
    in World of Warcraft. The method ensures proper positioning and synchronization
    of passengers with the transport's movement.
  parameters:
  - name: passenger
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that will be added as a passenger. This
      can be a Player, Creature, or other object that supports being on a transport.
  - name: offset
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the offset position on
      the transport where the passenger will be placed. The exact meaning and valid
      range of this value depends on the specific transport implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic passenger addition
    code: 'TransportBase* transport = ...;

      Player* player = ...;

      int offset = 0;

      transport->AddPassenger(player, offset);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding multiple passengers to different offsets
    code: 'TransportBase* transport = ...;

      Player* player1 = ...;

      Player* player2 = ...;

      transport->AddPassenger(player1, 0);

      transport->AddPassenger(player2, 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the transport system when passengers
    board or are assigned to a transport. Developers should ensure that the offset
    value is valid for the specific transport type and that the passenger object is
    properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid passenger pointer or an out-of-bounds
    offset may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate parameters
    before invoking this method, especially when dealing with dynamic passenger assignments.
