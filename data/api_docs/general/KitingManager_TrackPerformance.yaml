  class: KitingManager
  method: TrackPerformance
  signature: void KitingManager::TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds duration,
    const std::string & operation)
documentation:
  brief: Records performance metrics for kiting-related operations including duration
    and operation type.
  description: The TrackPerformance method is used to log timing data for various
    kiting-related activities within the TrinityCore framework. It accepts a time
    duration and an operation identifier, storing this information for later analysis
    or reporting. This functionality supports performance monitoring and optimization
    of player movement behaviors in-game, particularly those related to kiting mechanics
    such as evasion, pursuit, or strategic positioning. The method is typically invoked
    during critical gameplay events to capture timing data that can be used for balancing,
    debugging, or enhancing AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The time duration of the operation in microseconds, measured using
      std::chrono::microseconds
  - name: operation
    description: A string identifier describing the specific kiting-related operation
      being tracked (e.g., 'Evade', 'Pursue', 'Position')
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'KitingManager manager;

      std::chrono::microseconds duration(1500);

      manager.TrackPerformance(duration, "Evade");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Multiple Operations
    code: 'KitingManager manager;

      manager.TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds(2300), "Pursue");

      manager.TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds(1800), "Position");

      manager.TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds(950), "Evade");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring system and
    may store data in internal buffers or logs. The operation string should be consistent
    across similar operations to enable meaningful aggregation and analysis. Consider
    thread safety implications if called from multiple threads concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the duration parameter accurately reflects actual execution
    time, as incorrect timing data can skew performance analysis. Avoid calling this
    method excessively in tight loops without batching or throttling to prevent performance
    overhead.
