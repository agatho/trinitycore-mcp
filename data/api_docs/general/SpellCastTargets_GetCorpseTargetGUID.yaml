  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: GetCorpseTargetGUID
  signature: int SpellCastTargets::GetCorpseTargetGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUID of the corpse target associated with the spell cast.
  description: The GetCorpseTargetGUID method returns the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the corpse target that was specified during the spell casting process. This
    method is typically used in spell systems where targeting a corpse is required,
    such as for resurrection spells or other abilities that act upon dead bodies.
    The returned value represents the database ID of the corpse object and can be
    used to retrieve or manipulate the corpse entity within the game world. If no
    corpse target was set, this method will return zero or an invalid GUID value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the corpse target. A value of zero
    indicates that no valid corpse target exists for the current spell cast.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "void MySpell::Cast()\n{\n    if (SpellCastTargets* targets = GetSpellTargets())\n\
      \    {\n        int corpseGUID = targets->GetCorpseTargetGUID();\n        if\
      \ (corpseGUID != 0)\n        {\n            // Proceed with resurrection logic\
      \ using the corpse GUID\n            Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(corpseGUID));\n\
      \            // ... rest of the spell logic\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the SpellCastTargets object has been properly initialized
    with a valid corpse target. The GUID returned is typically used in conjunction
    with ObjectAccessor to retrieve the actual corpse object from memory.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell cast targets have been set before calling this method,
    otherwise it may return an invalid or zero GUID. This can lead to unexpected behavior
    if not properly checked.
