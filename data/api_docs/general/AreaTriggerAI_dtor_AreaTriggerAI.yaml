documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AreaTriggerAI instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AreaTriggerAI class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the lifetime
    of the area trigger AI object. This method ensures proper resource deallocation
    when an area trigger AI instance is removed from memory, such as when the area
    trigger itself expires or is destroyed. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this destructor plays a key role in maintaining memory
    integrity and preventing memory leaks for area trigger-based game mechanics like
    spell effects, quest triggers, or environmental interactions.

  - title: Default Destructor Usage
    code: 'AreaTriggerAI* ai = new AreaTriggerAI();

      // ... use the AI object ...

      delete ai; // Triggers ~AreaTriggerAI()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an AreaTriggerAI object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that derived classes
    may have their own destructors which should properly call the base class destructor
    to ensure complete cleanup.
