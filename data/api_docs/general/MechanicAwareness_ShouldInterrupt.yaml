  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: ShouldInterrupt
  signature: bool MechanicAwareness::ShouldInterrupt(Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell should be interrupted based on mechanic awareness
    rules.
  description: The ShouldInterrupt method evaluates if a specific spell cast by a
    target unit should be interrupted according to mechanic-awareness logic. This
    method is typically used in AI behavior systems to determine when spells should
    be disrupted, such as during combat or when certain conditions are met. It checks
    various spell mechanics and unit states to make this determination. The method
    considers factors like spell type, target state, and current combat situation
    to decide if interruption is warranted.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell casting
      is being evaluated for potential interruption
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast by the target that
      may be interrupted
  returns: Returns true if the spell should be interrupted based on mechanic awareness
    rules, false otherwise. The decision is made according to internal AI logic and
    game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (mechanicAwareness->ShouldInterrupt(targetUnit, spellId)) {\n    targetUnit->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with spell cast interruption logic
    code: "void AIUpdate(Unit* unit) {\n    if (unit->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\
      \ {\n        SpellInfo const* spellInfo = unit->GetCurrentSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL)->m_spellInfo;\n\
      \        if (spellInfo && mechanicAwareness->ShouldInterrupt(unit, spellInfo->Id))\
      \ {\n            unit->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\n        }\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI decision-making processes and may involve
    complex internal logic for evaluating spell mechanics. It's important to note
    that the actual interruption behavior depends on other systems within TrinityCore,
    such as spell casting state management and combat logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid null pointer dereferences. The spellId parameter must correspond to a
    valid spell in the game database for meaningful results.
