  class: GuildMgr
  method: GetGuildStore
  signature: const int & GuildMgr::GetGuildStore() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the guild's store identifier.
  description: The GetGuildStore method retrieves the unique identifier associated
    with a guild's in-game store or inventory system. This identifier is typically
    used to link guild members to their respective store data, enabling features such
    as guild-specific item purchases, storage management, and resource tracking within
    the TrinityCore framework. The returned reference points to an internal integer
    value that represents the store's index or ID within the game's data structures.
    This method is commonly invoked when performing operations related to guild commerce,
    item distribution, or administrative tasks involving guild resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the guild's store identifier.
    The value typically corresponds to a unique index or database ID used internally
    by TrinityCore to manage guild-specific storage systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Guild* guild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (guild)\n{\n    const\
      \ int& storeId = guild->GetGuildStore();\n    // Use storeId for further operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, meaning the value should not be
    modified directly. The returned integer is likely cached or derived from internal
    data structures and may change if guild data is reloaded or updated during runtime.
