documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cooldown time for warrior defensive abilities.
  description: The GetWarriorDefensiveCooldowns method returns the current cooldown
    duration in milliseconds for a warrior's defensive abilities. This method is typically
    used within PvP combat AI logic to determine when a warrior can next use defensive
    spells or abilities such as Shield Block, Defensive Stance, or other defensive
    cooldowns. The returned value represents how long the player must wait before
    being able to use these defensive actions again. This functionality is integral
    to balancing PvP encounters and ensuring proper cooldown management for warrior
    classes in TrinityCore's combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the cooldown time in milliseconds for warrior
    defensive abilities. A return value of 0 indicates that the defensive cooldowns
    are currently available for use, while a positive value indicates the remaining
    time until the cooldown expires.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP Combat AI
    code: "int cooldown = ai->GetWarriorDefensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\nif (cooldown\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Warrior can use defensive abilities\n    player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_SHIELD_BLOCK, true);\n} else {\n    // Wait until cooldown expires\n\
      \    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_PVP_COOLDOWN_ACTIVE, cooldown / 1000);\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI class and assumes that the AI instance
    has been properly initialized with a valid player context. The method does not
    perform any validation on the input parameter as it's marked as const and takes
    no parameters, suggesting it operates on internal state or player data from the
    AI context.
  warnings: The method signature shows a parameter of type int*, but it is marked
    as const and appears unused in typical usage patterns. Developers should verify
    that the AI instance has valid player data before calling this method to avoid
    unexpected behavior.
