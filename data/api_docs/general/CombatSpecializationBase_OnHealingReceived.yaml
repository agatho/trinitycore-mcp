  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::OnHealingReceived(::Unit * healer, uint32
    amount)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when healing is received by a unit in combat specialization.
  description: The OnHealingReceived method is invoked when a unit receives healing
    during combat. This method serves as a callback for combat specializations to
    react to healing events, allowing custom behavior or effects to be triggered.
    It provides access to both the healer unit and the amount of healing received,
    enabling developers to implement logic based on these parameters. The method is
    typically used in conjunction with combat specialization systems where specific
    actions need to occur upon receiving healing.
  parameters:
  - name: healer
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that provided the healing. This can be
      a player, NPC, or any game entity capable of healing.
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of healing points received by the unit. This value represents
      the total healing amount and is used for determining effects or reactions based
      on healing magnitude.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Healing Event Handler
    code: "void MyCombatSpec::OnHealingReceived(Unit* healer, uint32 amount)\n{\n\
      \    if (amount > 100)\n    {\n        // Trigger special effect for large heals\n\
      \        SendCustomMessage(\"Large heal received!\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Healing from Specific Healers
    code: "void MyCombatSpec::OnHealingReceived(Unit* healer, uint32 amount)\n{\n\
      \    if (healer->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_PLAYER && healer->GetName() == \"DruidPlayer\"\
      )\n    {\n        // Apply a buff or effect when healed by a specific player\n\
      \        ApplyBuff(HEALING_BUFF_ID);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the combat specialization system and may be overridden
    in derived classes to implement custom healing behavior. It's important to note
    that this method does not modify the healing amount itself but rather reacts to
    it. Ensure that any modifications or actions taken within this method do not cause
    performance issues or infinite loops.
  warnings: Do not attempt to directly modify the healing amount within this method,
    as it is a read-only event handler. Modifying unit state during this call may
    lead to unexpected behavior or race conditions if not handled carefully.
