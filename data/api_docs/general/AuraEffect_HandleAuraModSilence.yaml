  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModSilence(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes the silence effect aura on a target.
  description: The HandleAuraModSilence method manages the application and removal
    of the silence aura effect, which prevents the target from casting spells. This
    method is invoked during aura application or removal events and modifies the target's
    ability to cast spells based on the 'apply' parameter. The silence effect typically
    disables spellcasting for the affected unit, including both beneficial and harmful
    spells, and may also prevent certain abilities that require casting. This method
    interacts with the aura system's application context to ensure proper state management
    of the silence effect.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. Contains information about the aura's target, caster, and
      application state.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of aura application, typically indicating whether this is
      a normal application or a specific type of effect application (e.g., passive,
      active).
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the silence effect. When true, the target becomes silenced; when false, the
      silence is removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Silence Aura
    code: 'AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication(target, caster, auraInfo);

      auraEffect->HandleAuraModSilence(app, AURA_MODE_NORMAL, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Silence Aura
    code: "AuraApplication* app = GetAuraApplication();\nif (app)\n{\n    auraEffect->HandleAuraModSilence(app,\
      \ AURA_MODE_NORMAL, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's aura handling system and integrates
    with the spell casting system to disable or enable spellcasting capabilities.
    The silence effect may also prevent other abilities that require channeling or
    casting time. Ensure proper cleanup of aura applications to avoid memory leaks.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent game state where
    a unit remains silenced even after the silence aura has expired. Always ensure
    that the 'apply' parameter matches the intended effect and that corresponding
    removal events are handled properly.
