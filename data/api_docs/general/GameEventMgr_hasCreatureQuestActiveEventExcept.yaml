  method: hasCreatureQuestActiveEventExcept
  signature: bool GameEventMgr::hasCreatureQuestActiveEventExcept(uint32 quest_id,
    uint16 event_id)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a creature quest is active in any event except the specified event.
  description: The hasCreatureQuestActiveEventExcept method determines whether a specific
    quest associated with a creature is currently active within any active game event,
    excluding a particular event ID. This functionality is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage quest availability during seasonal or holiday
    events, ensuring that quests do not appear in conflicting or unintended event
    contexts. The method evaluates the current state of active events and their associated
    quest mappings to return a boolean result indicating whether the specified quest
    is active outside of the excluded event.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the creature quest to check for activity.
      This value corresponds to the quest entry in the database.
  - name: event_id
    description: The event ID to exclude from the check. If the quest is active in
      any event except this one, the method returns true.
  returns: Returns true if the specified creature quest is active in any currently
    active game event except the excluded event ID; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a quest is active outside of a specific event
    code: "if (sGameEventMgr->hasCreatureQuestActiveEventExcept(12345, 67890)) {\n\
      \    // Quest 12345 is active in some event but not event 67890\n    // Perform\
      \ relevant logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal tracking of active game events and their
    associated quest mappings. It should be called only when the game event system
    is properly initialized and active events are loaded.
  warnings: Ensure that both quest_id and event_id are valid identifiers to avoid
    unexpected behavior or incorrect results. This method does not validate parameter
    values internally.
