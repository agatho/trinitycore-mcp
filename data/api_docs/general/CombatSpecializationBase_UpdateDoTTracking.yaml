  method: UpdateDoTTracking
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::UpdateDoTTracking(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the tracking of DoT (Damage over Time) effects on the specified target
    unit.
  description: The UpdateDoTTracking method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the internal tracking state of Damage over Time (DoT) effects applied to a given
    target unit. This method ensures that the combat specialization system accurately
    monitors active DoT spells, their durations, damage values, and other relevant
    properties. It typically gets invoked during combat updates or when new DoT effects
    are applied or removed from the target. The method may also handle cleanup of
    expired DoT entries and synchronization of DoT-related statistics within the specialization's
    tracking mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose DoT effects
      are being tracked. Must not be null. The unit should be in combat or have active
      DoT effects for meaningful operation.
  returns: No return value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat update
    code: "void MyCombatSpecialization::OnCombatUpdate(Unit* target)\n{\n    UpdateDoTTracking(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with DoT effect management
    code: "void MyCombatSpecialization::HandleDotApplication(Unit* target, SpellInfo\
      \ const* spellInfo)\n{\n    // Apply DoT effect logic here\n    UpdateDoTTracking(target);\n\
      \    // Additional tracking or stat updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the combat system during regular
    update cycles. It's important to ensure that the target unit pointer passed is
    valid and not destroyed before this method completes. The implementation may involve
    iterating through active aura applications on the target, checking for DoT spell
    effects, and updating internal tracking structures accordingly.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid Unit pointer to this method will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target unit is valid and in
    a state where DoT tracking makes sense (e.g., in combat).
