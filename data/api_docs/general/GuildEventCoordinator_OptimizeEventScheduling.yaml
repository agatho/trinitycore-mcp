  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: OptimizeEventScheduling
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::OptimizeEventScheduling(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the scheduling of guild events by reorganizing event timing to
    minimize conflicts and maximize player participation.
  description: The OptimizeEventScheduling method is responsible for adjusting the
    timing of scheduled guild events to reduce overlapping occurrences and improve
    overall event coordination. This method analyzes existing event schedules, identifies
    potential conflicts between events, and modifies event times where necessary to
    ensure that guild members can participate in as many events as possible without
    overlap. It considers player availability, event types, and guild resource constraints
    during the optimization process. The method is typically invoked when new events
    are added or when significant changes occur in guild activity patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier whose participation
      may be considered during scheduling optimization. This parameter allows the
      method to prioritize or adjust event times based on specific player availability
      or preferences.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.OptimizeEventScheduling(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Players
    code: "std::vector<int> playerIds = {12345, 67890, 54321};\nGuildEventCoordinator\
      \ coordinator;\nfor (int playerId : playerIds)\n{\n    coordinator.OptimizeEventScheduling(&playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may modify internal event scheduling data structures and should
    be called after significant changes to guild events or player availability. It
    is recommended to call this method periodically, especially when adding new events
    or when there are major shifts in guild activity.
  warnings: The method modifies event schedules which could affect player expectations.
    Ensure proper communication with guild members about any schedule changes resulting
    from this optimization. Avoid calling this method during active events as it may
    cause unexpected disruptions.
