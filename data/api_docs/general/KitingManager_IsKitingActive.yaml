documentation:
  brief: Determines whether kiting behavior is currently active for the player
  description: The IsKitingActive method checks if the player is currently engaged
    in kiting, a combat technique where the player maintains distance from enemies
    while dealing damage. This method evaluates various internal states and conditions
    to determine if kiting mechanics are active, including movement patterns, target
    engagement, and AI decision-making processes. The result indicates whether the
    kiting behavior should be applied or suspended based on current game context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if kiting behavior is currently active for the player; returns
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the system believes the player should
    be following kiting mechanics such as maintaining distance from targets, using
    ranged attacks, or employing specific movement patterns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (kitingManager.IsKitingActive()) {\n    // Player is currently kiting\n\
      \    // Apply kiting-specific logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Kiting Logic
    code: "void UpdatePlayerBehavior() {\n    if (kitingManager.IsKitingActive())\
      \ {\n        // Adjust movement to maintain distance\n        // Prioritize\
      \ ranged attacks\n        // Avoid close combat\n    } else {\n        // Normal\
      \ combat behavior\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state tracking of player movement,
    target proximity, and combat engagement. It may consider factors such as player
    speed, target distance, attack type, and AI decision trees to determine kiting
    status. The implementation might be optimized for performance since it's likely
    called frequently during gameplay.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole indicator of player intent or
    behavior. Kiting status can change rapidly based on environmental factors and
    combat situations. Relying solely on this flag without considering other game
    states may lead to incorrect AI behavior or player experience issues.
