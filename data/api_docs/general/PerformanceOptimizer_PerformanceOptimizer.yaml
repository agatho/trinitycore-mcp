  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: PerformanceOptimizer
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::PerformanceOptimizer()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the performance optimization subsystem for the TrinityCore server.
  description: The PerformanceOptimizer constructor initializes internal data structures
    and sets up monitoring mechanisms for tracking server performance metrics. This
    method is typically called during server startup or when performance monitoring
    needs to be enabled. It configures various thresholds, registers performance callbacks,
    and prepares the system to track resource usage including CPU, memory, and database
    query times. The initialization process ensures that subsequent performance-related
    operations can be accurately measured and optimized without impacting server stability.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      // Constructor automatically initializes performance monitoring'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once during server initialization.
    Multiple instantiations may cause resource conflicts or duplicate monitoring.
    The method performs no heavy operations and is designed to complete quickly.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly in performance-critical code paths
    as it may introduce unexpected overhead. The PerformanceOptimizer class should
    typically be instantiated as a singleton or global object.
