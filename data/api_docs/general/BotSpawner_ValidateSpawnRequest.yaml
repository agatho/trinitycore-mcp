  class: BotSpawner
  method: ValidateSpawnRequest
  signature: bool BotSpawner::ValidateSpawnRequest(const int & request) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates a bot spawn request to ensure it meets all necessary conditions
    for spawning.
  description: The ValidateSpawnRequest method checks whether a given spawn request
    is valid and can be processed by the BotSpawner system. It evaluates various criteria
    such as resource availability, player permissions, map restrictions, and configuration
    limits. This method ensures that only legitimate spawn requests are allowed to
    proceed, preventing invalid or malicious attempts to spawn bots. The validation
    process typically occurs before any actual spawning logic is executed, making
    it a critical part of the bot spawning pipeline.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier representing the spawn request to validate.
      This value usually corresponds to a unique request ID or type code used internally
      by the BotSpawner system.
  returns: Returns true if the spawn request is valid and can proceed, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that one or more validation checks failed, preventing
    the bot from being spawned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "int spawnRequest = 12345;\nif (botSpawner->ValidateSpawnRequest(spawnRequest))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with spawning logic\n    botSpawner->SpawnBot(spawnRequest);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid request\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid spawn\
      \ request: %d\", spawnRequest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spawn Handler
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    bool HandleSpawnRequest(int requestId)\
      \ {\n        if (!botSpawner->ValidateSpawnRequest(requestId)) {\n         \
      \   return false;\n        }\n        // Proceed with actual spawning\n    \
      \    return botSpawner->ExecuteSpawn(requestId);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization phase of a spawn
    request. It may perform database lookups or configuration checks, so performance
    should be considered in high-frequency scenarios. The method is marked as const,
    indicating it does not modify internal state.
  warnings: Ensure that all possible validation paths are properly tested, especially
    edge cases involving invalid request IDs or out-of-bounds values. Improper handling
    of validation failures could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
