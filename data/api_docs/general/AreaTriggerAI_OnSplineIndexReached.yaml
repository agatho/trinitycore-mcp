  class: AreaTriggerAI
  method: OnSplineIndexReached
  signature: void AreaTriggerAI::OnSplineIndexReached(int32 splineIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when an area trigger reaches a specific spline index during movement.
  description: The OnSplineIndexReached method is a virtual callback function in the
    AreaTriggerAI class that gets triggered whenever an area trigger finishes moving
    along a spline path and reaches a particular spline index. This method allows
    developers to implement custom behavior at specific points during the area trigger's
    movement animation, such as triggering effects, changing states, or executing
    actions based on the current position in the spline path. It is commonly used
    in conjunction with spline-based movement for area triggers that need to perform
    actions at defined waypoints or milestones along their trajectory.
  parameters:
  - name: splineIndex
    description: The index of the spline point that was reached during movement. This
      value indicates the current position within the spline path, starting from zero
      and incrementing as the area trigger progresses through the defined waypoints.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnSplineIndexReached(int32\
      \ splineIndex) override\n    {\n        if (splineIndex == 5)\n        {\n \
      \           // Trigger special effect at spline index 5\n            GetAreaTrigger()->SetSpellVisualKit(12345);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "class CustomAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnSplineIndexReached(int32 splineIndex) override\n    {\n        switch (splineIndex)\n\
      \        {\n            case 0:\n                // Start animation\n      \
      \          break;\n            case 10:\n                // Play sound effect\n\
      \                GetAreaTrigger()->PlaySound(45678);\n                break;\n\
      \            case 20:\n                // Activate spell\n                GetAreaTrigger()->CastSpell(GetAreaTrigger(),\
      \ 98765, true);\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called from within the area trigger's movement update loop.
    It should be used carefully to avoid performance bottlenecks, especially if complex
    logic or database queries are involved. The spline index corresponds directly
    to the waypoints defined in the area trigger's movement path configuration.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations inside this method as it is called frequently
    during movement. Ensure that any modifications to the area trigger's state or
    behavior do not interfere with ongoing movement or other AI systems.
