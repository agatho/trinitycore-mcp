  class: TerrainInfo
  method: LoadMMap
  signature: void TerrainInfo::LoadMMap(int32 gx, int32 gy)
documentation:
  brief: Loads the mmap for the specified grid coordinates.
  description: The LoadMMap method is responsible for loading the navigation mesh
    data (mmap) for a specific grid location in the game world. This method is typically
    invoked when pathfinding is required for AI or player movement within a particular
    zone. It ensures that the necessary terrain and obstacle data is available for
    efficient path calculation. The method operates on grid coordinates (gx, gy) which
    represent the chunk of the world map to load. This functionality is crucial for
    maintaining performance in large-scale game environments where loading all mmap
    data at once would be inefficient.
  parameters:
  - name: gx
    description: The x-coordinate of the grid to load mmap data for. Represents the
      horizontal position in the world grid system.
  - name: gy
    description: The y-coordinate of the grid to load mmap data for. Represents the
      vertical position in the world grid system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LoadMMap
    code: 'TerrainInfo* terrain = ...;

      int32 gridX = 10;

      int32 gridY = 15;

      terrain->LoadMMap(gridX, gridY);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the navigation mesh system used by TrinityCore for
    pathfinding. It's usually called automatically when needed by the AI or movement
    systems, but can also be invoked manually for specific use cases. The method may
    block until the mmap data is fully loaded if it's not already cached.
  warnings: Calling LoadMMap with invalid grid coordinates may result in undefined
    behavior or errors. Ensure that grid coordinates are within valid bounds before
    calling this method. Frequent calls to LoadMMap without proper caching can negatively
    impact performance.
