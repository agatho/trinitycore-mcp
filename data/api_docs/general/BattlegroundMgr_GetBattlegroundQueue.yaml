  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: GetBattlegroundQueue
  signature: BattlegroundQueue & BattlegroundMgr::GetBattlegroundQueue(int bgQueueTypeId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a reference to the battleground queue associated with the specified
    queue type ID.
  description: The GetBattlegroundQueue method retrieves a reference to a specific
    battleground queue within the BattlegroundMgr. This queue is used to manage players
    waiting to join battlegrounds of a particular type. The method takes an integer
    representing the battleground queue type ID and returns a reference to the corresponding
    BattlegroundQueue object. This allows for direct manipulation of the queue, such
    as adding or removing players, checking queue status, or accessing queue-specific
    configurations. The method is essential for handling player matchmaking and queue
    management in World of Warcraft's battleground system.
  parameters:
  - name: bgQueueTypeId
    description: An integer identifier representing the type of battleground queue
      to retrieve. This ID corresponds to specific battleground types such as Alterac
      Valley, Warsong Gulch, or Eye of the Storm.
  returns: A reference to the BattlegroundQueue object associated with the specified
    queue type ID. The reference is guaranteed to be valid if the queue type exists;
    otherwise, accessing an invalid queue may result in undefined behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing a specific battleground queue
    code: 'BattlegroundQueue& bgQueue = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundQueue(BATTLEGROUND_AV);

      // Now you can use bgQueue to manage players in Alterac Valley queue'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if a queue has players before adding new ones
    code: "BattlegroundQueue& queue = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundQueue(BATTLEGROUND_WS);\n\
      if (queue.GetPlayerCount() > 0)\n{\n    // Process queue logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal queue object managed by the
    BattlegroundMgr. It is important to ensure that the bgQueueTypeId parameter corresponds
    to a valid battleground queue type, otherwise accessing the returned reference
    may lead to undefined behavior. The returned reference should not be stored for
    extended periods as it might become invalid if the queue is destroyed or recreated.
  warnings: Do not use this method with invalid queue type IDs as it may cause crashes
    or memory corruption. Always verify that the queue exists before attempting to
    access it. Be cautious when modifying queue contents directly through the returned
    reference, as improper handling can disrupt matchmaking and player experience.
