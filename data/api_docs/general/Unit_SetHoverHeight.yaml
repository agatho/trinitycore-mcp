  class: Unit
  method: SetHoverHeight
  signature: void Unit::SetHoverHeight(float hoverHeight)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the hover height for the unit, enabling it to hover above ground level.
  description: This method allows a unit to set its hover height, which determines
    how high above the ground the unit can hover. It is commonly used in game mechanics
    where units need to be elevated above normal ground level, such as during certain
    spell effects or movement behaviors. The hover height value affects how the unit
    interacts with terrain and can influence collision detection and movement calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: hoverHeight
    description: The height in meters that the unit should hover above the ground
      level. This value is typically positive and determines the vertical offset from
      the ground.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      unit->SetHoverHeight(1.5f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      float hoverHeight = 2.0f;

      unit->SetHoverHeight(hoverHeight);

      // This will make the unit hover 2 meters above ground level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can affect the unit's collision
    behavior and movement calculations. Setting a hover height of zero or negative
    values may cause unexpected behavior in movement mechanics.
  warnings: Setting hover height to values that are too high may result in the unit
    being unable to properly interact with ground terrain, potentially causing issues
    with movement and collision detection.
