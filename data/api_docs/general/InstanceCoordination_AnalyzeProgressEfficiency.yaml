  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: AnalyzeProgressEfficiency
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::AnalyzeProgressEfficiency(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and evaluates the efficiency of group progress within an instance
    coordination context.
  description: The AnalyzeProgressEfficiency method evaluates how effectively a group
    is progressing through an instance, considering factors such as player performance,
    resource usage, and completion rates. This method is typically invoked during
    instance management operations to determine whether the group's current strategy
    or behavior aligns with optimal performance metrics. It may be used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to provide insights for instance balancing, player
    feedback, or dynamic difficulty adjustment. The method operates on a provided
    Group object and performs calculations or checks based on the group's current
    state within an instance environment.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: A pointer to the Group object representing the group whose progress
      efficiency is being analyzed. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid group currently engaged in an instance.
  returns: None. The method performs internal analysis and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->AnalyzeProgressEfficiency(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for managing group-based instances
    in TrinityCore. It may influence game mechanics such as loot distribution, instance
    timers, or player rewards based on efficiency metrics.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null;
    otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method should only be called when
    a group is actively participating in an instance.
