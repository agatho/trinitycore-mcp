  class: MotionMaster
  method: Remove
  signature: void MotionMaster::Remove(MovementGeneratorType type, MovementSlot slot)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific movement generator of the given type from the specified
    slot in the motion master.
  description: The Remove method is used to remove a movement generator of a specified
    type from a designated slot within the MotionMaster. This operation is typically
    invoked when a creature or player needs to stop following a particular movement
    behavior, such as stopping a waypoint path or interrupting a chase movement. The
    method ensures that only the movement generator matching both the provided type
    and slot is removed, allowing for precise control over active movement behaviors.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with other motion management methods to dynamically
    alter an object's movement state during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The MovementGeneratorType enum value indicating the type of movement
      generator to remove. This specifies what kind of movement behavior should be
      eliminated, such as idle, waypoint, chase, or flee movements.
  - name: slot
    description: The MovementSlot enum value specifying which slot in the motion master's
      movement stack should have its matching movement generator removed. Slots are
      typically used to manage multiple concurrent movement behaviors with priority
      ordering.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a waypoint movement from slot 0
    code: motionMaster.Remove(MOVEMENTTYPE_WAYPOINT, MOVEMENT_SLOT_ACTIVE);
    language: cpp
  - title: Stop chase movement in the default slot
    code: motionMaster.Remove(MOVEMENTTYPE_CHASE, MOVEMENT_SLOT_DEFAULT);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly delete the movement generator object; it only
    removes it from the motion master's internal tracking. The actual destruction
    of the movement generator may occur later depending on reference counting or garbage
    collection mechanisms in the system.
  warnings: Calling Remove with an invalid type or slot value may result in undefined
    behavior or no-op execution. Ensure that the specified movement generator actually
    exists in the given slot before attempting removal to avoid potential issues.
