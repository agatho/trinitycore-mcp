documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the GameEventMgr class
  description: The instance() method is a static accessor function that provides global
    access to the single GameEventMgr object in the TrinityCore server. This method
    implements the singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of the GameEventMgr
    exists throughout the application lifecycle. The returned pointer can be used
    to access all game event management functionality including event activation,
    deactivation, scheduling, and state tracking. This is essential for managing seasonal
    events, holidays, and other time-based game mechanics within World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton GameEventMgr instance. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access game events
    code: "GameEventMgr* eventMgr = GameEventMgr::instance();\nbool isEventActive\
      \ = eventMgr->IsActiveEvent(1234);\nif (isEventActive)\n{\n    // Handle event-specific\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using instance to manage event states
    code: "GameEventMgr* mgr = GameEventMgr::instance();\n// Check if a specific event\
      \ is running\nif (mgr->IsActiveEvent(5678))\n{\n    // Apply event bonuses or\
      \ modifications\n    sWorld->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_STRING, \"Special\
      \ event active!\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Normal gameplay logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's implemented as a singleton with proper
    initialization. The GameEventMgr instance is created during server startup and
    destroyed at shutdown, making this method safe to call throughout the server's
    lifetime.
