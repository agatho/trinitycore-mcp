documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CollectionMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CollectionMgr class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This method ensures
    proper cleanup of internal data structures, collections, and any cached information
    related to player collections. It is automatically invoked when a CollectionMgr
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor does not take
    any parameters and performs no return operations. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this method plays a critical role in maintaining
    memory efficiency and preventing resource leaks during server runtime.

  - title: Automatic destruction of CollectionMgr instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    CollectionMgr* mgr = new CollectionMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go out of scope or are
    deleted. Developers should ensure that no references to CollectionMgr instances
    remain after deletion to prevent dangling pointers.
