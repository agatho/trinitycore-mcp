  method: GetDefaultSpecId
  signature: uint32 Player::GetDefaultSpecId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the default specialization ID for the player.
  description: This method retrieves the default specialization ID assigned to a player,
    which is used as the primary spec identifier when no specific specialization is
    active. The returned value represents the unique identifier of the player's default
    talent specialization, typically corresponding to the first available spec in
    the game. This value is crucial for determining the player's baseline talent build
    and is often used in conjunction with other spec-related methods to manage character
    progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the default specialization ID. This value
    corresponds to the unique identifier of the player's default spec, typically matching
    the first available spec in the game system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 defaultSpecId = player->GetDefaultSpecId();\nif (defaultSpecId !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Player has a valid default spec\n    std::cout << \"Default\
      \ Spec ID: \" << defaultSpecId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with GetSpecId() to determine
    the current active spec. Implementation details may vary depending on how the
    player's default spec is defined internally, and it should be noted that this
    value may differ from the actual spec ID when a player has changed their specialization.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with GetSpecId(), which returns the
    currently active spec ID. The default spec ID returned by this method is often
    used for baseline comparisons and may not reflect the current spec if the player
    has changed their specialization.
