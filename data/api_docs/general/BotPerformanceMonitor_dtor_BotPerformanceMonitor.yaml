documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotPerformanceMonitor instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotPerformanceMonitor class is responsible for
    releasing any memory or system resources that were allocated during the object's
    lifetime. This method ensures proper cleanup of performance monitoring data structures
    and prevents memory leaks when the monitor object goes out of scope. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI bot system, this destructor likely handles cleanup of timing
    measurements, statistics tracking, and any internal buffers used for performance
    analysis.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotPerformanceMonitor
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;\n    // ...\
      \ perform bot operations ...\n    // monitor is automatically destroyed here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is implicitly called when a BotPerformanceMonitor object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no other
    threads are accessing the monitor during destruction, as cleanup operations may
    involve releasing shared resources.
