documentation:
  brief: Updates the timers for active combat specialization buffs.
  description: The UpdateBuffTimers method is responsible for managing and updating
    the duration timers of active combat specialization buffs within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method is typically invoked during each game tick to decrement
    buff durations and handle expiration logic. It ensures that player specializations
    maintain accurate timing for their active abilities, which is crucial for gameplay
    balance and mechanics such as cooldowns, proc rates, and resource management.
    The method processes all currently applied buffs and removes those that have reached
    zero duration.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateCombatSpecializations(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto&\
      \ player : m_players)\n    {\n        if (player->GetCombatSpecialization())\n\
      \        {\n            player->GetCombatSpecialization()->UpdateBuffTimers(diff);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to maintain accurate
    buff state. It's typically invoked with a time delta (diff) parameter that represents
    milliseconds since last update. The implementation may involve internal tracking
    of active buffs and their remaining durations.
