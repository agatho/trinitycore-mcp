  signature: bool QuestTrigger::HasAvailableQuest(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the quest trigger has any available quests for the specified bot
    AI.
  description: The HasAvailableQuest method determines whether there are any quests
    currently available for the bot AI associated with this quest trigger. This check
    typically evaluates the player's quest log, quest availability conditions, and
    other relevant game state factors to determine if the bot can accept or interact
    with a quest from this trigger. The method is commonly used in AI decision-making
    logic to decide whether to engage with a quest giver or quest object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are available quests for the bot AI, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the quest trigger can provide actionable quests to the
    AI-controlled character.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (questTrigger->HasAvailableQuest(ai)) {\n    // Proceed with quest interaction\n\
      \    ai->GetBot()->GetQuestInterface()->AcceptQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the bot's current quest state,
    including quest completion status, level requirements, and faction restrictions.
    It may also consider quest timers or other dynamic conditions that affect quest
    availability.
