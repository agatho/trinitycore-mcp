  class: Quest
  method: GetContentTuningId
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetContentTuningId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the content tuning ID associated with the quest.
  description: The GetContentTuningId method retrieves the content tuning identifier
    that corresponds to a specific quest in the TrinityCore database. This identifier
    is used to determine the appropriate difficulty level and content scaling for
    the quest based on the player's level and the game's content tuning system. The
    method is typically used during quest processing and reward calculations to ensure
    proper quest progression and rewards. It returns zero if no content tuning ID
    is assigned to the quest.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the content tuning ID associated with the
    quest. This value is typically zero if no content tuning has been assigned, or
    a positive integer indicating the specific content tuning level for the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 contentTuningId = quest->GetContentTuningId();\nif (contentTuningId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Quest has content tuning assigned\n    // Perform actions\
      \ based on the tuning ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest system's internal mechanics and should be
    used carefully during quest processing. The content tuning ID may vary depending
    on the quest's level range and the player's current level, making it important
    for proper quest progression.
