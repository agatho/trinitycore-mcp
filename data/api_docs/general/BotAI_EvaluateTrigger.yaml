  class: BotAI
  method: EvaluateTrigger
  signature: void BotAI::EvaluateTrigger(Trigger * trigger)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates a trigger within the bot's AI system to determine if it should
    be activated based on current conditions.
  description: The EvaluateTrigger method processes a given Trigger object within
    the BotAI system, assessing whether the trigger's conditions are currently met.
    This method is part of the core decision-making logic for bots in TrinityCore,
    allowing them to respond dynamically to in-game events or states. It typically
    integrates with the bot's state machine and action selection system to determine
    appropriate behaviors. The evaluation considers various factors such as player
    health, distance to targets, available resources, and other contextual game data.
    This method is called internally by the AI framework during each update cycle
    or when specific events occur that may affect trigger validity.
  parameters:
  - name: trigger
    description: A pointer to the Trigger object that needs to be evaluated. The trigger
      contains conditions and actions that define when and how the bot should respond
      to certain game states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Evaluation
    code: "void MyBot::OnUpdate(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Evaluate a specific trigger\n\
      \    Trigger* myTrigger = GetTriggerById(12345);\n    if (myTrigger)\n     \
      \   EvaluateTrigger(myTrigger);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Evaluating All Triggers in BotAI
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // Iterate through all registered triggers\n\
      \    for (auto& trigger : m_triggers)\n    {\n        if (trigger)\n       \
      \     EvaluateTrigger(trigger);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the AI update cycle and should not
    be called directly from outside the AI framework unless you have a specific reason.
    The evaluation process may involve complex condition checking that could impact
    performance if done excessively. Consider caching trigger results when possible
    to avoid redundant evaluations.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer for 'trigger' will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate that the trigger exists before
    calling EvaluateTrigger. Additionally, modifying trigger conditions during evaluation
    can lead to inconsistent AI behavior.
