documentation:
  brief: Sends a spell visual kit to the unit's client for display.
  description: This method sends a spell visual kit to the specified unit's client,
    allowing the client to display the visual effects associated with a specific spell.
    The method is used primarily for sending visual effects that are part of a spell's
    animation, such as those used in combat or other gameplay situations. It allows
    for precise control over when and how visual effects are displayed to players,
    particularly in relation to spell casting or other game mechanics involving visual
    effects.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The ID of the spell visual kit to be sent. This corresponds to a
      specific visual effect defined in the spell visual kit table.
  - name: type
    description: The type of the spell visual kit, typically indicating how the visual
      should be applied (e.g., whether it's a continuous effect or a one-time display).
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the visual effect should be
      displayed. This controls how long the visual will remain active on the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player;

      unit->SendPlaySpellVisualKit(12345, 1, 5000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player;

      unit->SendPlaySpellVisualKit(54321, 2, 3000);

      // This would send a visual effect for 3 seconds

      // and is typically used in conjunction with spell effects or other gameplay
      mechanics.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the client's
    visual experience. It is generally used in conjunction with spell casting or similar
    gameplay mechanics where visual effects are required. The method may be called
    from any thread, but care must be taken to ensure that the unit being targeted
    is a valid player or NPC.
  warnings: The method should not be used on non-player units without careful consideration,
    as it will only work for players. Also, incorrect use of duration can lead to
    visual artifacts or incorrect behavior in gameplay mechanics. Ensure that the
    ID and type values are valid and match the expected spell visual kit data.
