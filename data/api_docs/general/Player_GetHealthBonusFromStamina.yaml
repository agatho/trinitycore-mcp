documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the health bonus derived from stamina for the player.
  description: This method computes the health bonus that a player gains from their
    stamina attribute, which is a crucial component in determining overall health
    points. The calculation involves applying the stamina-to-health conversion factor
    based on game mechanics and player class-specific formulas. It typically returns
    a float value representing the additional health points gained through stamina.
    This method is essential for understanding player character stats and health calculations
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the health bonus derived from stamina.
    The value may be zero or positive, depending on the player's current stamina and
    class-specific calculations. It represents additional health points gained through
    stamina attribute.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'float healthBonus = player->GetHealthBonusFromStamina();

      // This value can be used to calculate total health

      float totalHealth = player->GetMaxHealth() + healthBonus;'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include the method being part of the Player class
    and relying on internal stamina calculations. Performance considerations are minimal
    as this is a simple calculation, but it's important to note that the value may
    vary based on player level, class, and equipment. Thread safety is not an issue
    as this method is typically called from within a single thread context.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when calculating total health points,
    as incorrect application can lead to inaccurate health values. The calculation
    might not reflect actual game mechanics if the player's stamina is not properly
    accounted for in calculations.
