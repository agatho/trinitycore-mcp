  class: RoleAssignment
  method: OptimizeForDungeon
  signature: void RoleAssignment::OptimizeForDungeon(Group * group, uint32 dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes role assignments within a group for dungeon content based on player
    roles and class distributions.
  description: The OptimizeForDungeon method adjusts role assignments within a specified
    group to ensure optimal distribution of tank, healer, and damage dealer roles
    for dungeon encounters. This method analyzes the composition of players in the
    group, considering their classes, specializations, and existing role assignments,
    and redistributes roles to maximize efficiency and success rate in dungeon scenarios.
    It is typically invoked when a group enters a dungeon or when role changes occur
    during gameplay. The optimization process ensures that each role type (tank, healer,
    DPS) has appropriate representation based on the group's makeup and the specific
    requirements of the dungeon content.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players whose roles will be
      optimized. Must not be null.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: Unique identifier for the dungeon type being entered. Used to determine
      optimal role distribution based on dungeon requirements and player capabilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon entry
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterDungeon(Player* player, uint32 dungeonId)\n{\n    Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n    {\n        RoleAssignment::OptimizeForDungeon(group,\
      \ dungeonId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role optimization after group composition change
    code: "void OnPlayerAddedToGroup(Player* player, Group* group)\n{\n    if (group\
      \ && group->GetMembersCount() >= 2)\n    {\n        RoleAssignment::OptimizeForDungeon(group,\
      \ GetCurrentDungeonId());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies player role assignments in-place and does not return
    any value. It assumes that the group is valid and contains players with appropriate
    role information. The optimization algorithm considers class-specific roles, specialization
    levels, and existing role assignments to achieve balanced distribution across
    the group.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null group pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the group has at least one member before calling this function. This
    method modifies internal role state of players within the group, so it should
    be used carefully during gameplay transitions or when roles are being reassigned.
