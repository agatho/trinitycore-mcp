  class: MawPower
  method: operator!=
  signature: bool MawPower::operator!=(const MawPower & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two MawPower objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this MawPower object
    and another MawPower object to determine if they are not equal. It is used to
    check whether the data or state of two MawPower instances differs. This comparison
    typically involves checking internal fields such as power type, value, or other
    identifying characteristics. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    MawPower represents a specific type of power associated with the Maw of Souls
    dungeon mechanic, where players may accumulate different types of power during
    their quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The MawPower object to compare against this instance. This parameter
      must be a valid MawPower object; passing an invalid or uninitialized object
      may result in undefined behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the two MawPower objects are not equal, and false if they
    are equal. The comparison is based on internal member variables of the MawPower
    class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check
    code: 'MawPower power1;

      MawPower power2;

      bool result = (power1 != power2); // Returns true if power1 and power2 differ
      in any field'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using inequality in conditional logic
    code: "if (playerMawPower != targetMawPower) {\n    // Perform actions when powers\
      \ are different\n    SendCustomMessage(\"Powers do not match\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using a member-wise comparison of
    all relevant fields within the MawPower class. It should be efficient and avoid
    unnecessary overhead, especially in performance-critical code paths such as game
    state updates or AI decision-making loops.
  warnings: Ensure that both operands are properly initialized before calling this
    operator to prevent undefined behavior. If either operand is a null pointer (though
    unlikely for value types), the behavior is undefined.
