  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: TeleportToZone
  signature: bool BotWorldPositioner::TeleportToZone(Player * bot, const ZonePlacement
    * placement)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports a bot player to a specified zone using provided placement data.
  description: The TeleportToZone method is responsible for moving a bot player to
    a designated zone within the game world. It utilizes the provided ZonePlacement
    structure to determine the correct location and orientation for the teleportation.
    This method ensures that the bot is placed in the intended zone while respecting
    game mechanics such as instance handling, map boundaries, and player state validation.
    The method performs necessary checks to ensure the teleportation is valid before
    executing it.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be teleported.
      Must not be null.
  - name: placement
    description: Pointer to a ZonePlacement structure containing the destination zone
      information including coordinates, map ID, and other placement parameters. Must
      not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the teleportation was successful and the bot has been moved
    to the specified zone; otherwise returns false if the operation failed due to
    invalid parameters, invalid zone data, or other teleportation constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Teleport Usage
    code: "Player* myBot = ...;\nZonePlacement placement;\nplacement.mapId = 0;\n\
      placement.x = 1234.5f;\nplacement.y = 6789.0f;\nplacement.z = 100.0f;\nbool\
      \ success = botWorldPositioner->TeleportToZone(myBot, &placement);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Bot successfully teleported\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Teleport with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = GetBot();\nif (!bot) return false;\n\nZonePlacement zonePlacement;\n\
      zonePlacement.mapId = 1417; // Outland\nzonePlacement.x = 1000.0f;\nzonePlacement.y\
      \ = 2000.0f;\nzonePlacement.z = 50.0f;\n\nif (botWorldPositioner->TeleportToZone(bot,\
      \ &zonePlacement)) {\n    // Teleport successful\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot\
      \ teleported to zone successfully\");\n} else {\n    // Handle teleport failure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to teleport bot to zone\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI systems for bots that need to navigate
    between different zones or areas of the game world. The ZonePlacement structure
    may contain additional metadata such as instance IDs or orientation data that
    affects how the teleportation is handled. The method internally validates the
    destination coordinates and map ID before attempting the actual teleport.
  warnings: Ensure that the ZonePlacement data provided is valid and within the bounds
    of the game world to prevent undefined behavior. Passing null pointers for either
    parameter will likely result in a crash or undefined behavior. Be aware that teleporting
    bots may cause issues with quest tracking or other player state management if
    not handled properly.
