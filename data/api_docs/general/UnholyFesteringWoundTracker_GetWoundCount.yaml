  class: UnholyFesteringWoundTracker
  method: GetWoundCount
  signature: uint32 UnholyFesteringWoundTracker::GetWoundCount(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current count of festering wounds associated with a specified
    GUID.
  description: The GetWoundCount method returns the number of active festering wounds
    tracked for a given unit identifier (GUID). This functionality is typically used
    in the context of the Unholy Death Knight talent Festering Wound, which causes
    periodic damage over time. The method allows the system to query how many instances
    of this debuff are currently applied to a specific target. It is designed to be
    a read-only operation that does not modify any internal state. The GUID parameter
    refers to the unique identifier of the unit (player or creature) for which the
    wound count is being retrieved.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit for which the festering
      wound count is requested. This should be a valid object GUID from the TrinityCore
      database.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of active festering wounds on the
    specified unit. Returns zero if no festering wounds are currently applied to the
    target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check wound count
    code: "uint32 woundCount = unholyFesteringWoundTracker->GetWoundCount(playerGuid);\n\
      if (woundCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process logic based on active wounds\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      wound_tracker\", \"Player has {} active festering wounds.\", woundCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using wound count for damage calculation
    code: "Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*m_caster, targetGuid);\nif (target)\n\
      {\n    uint32 woundCount = unholyFesteringWoundTracker->GetWoundCount(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    if (woundCount > 0)\n    {\n        // Apply damage based on wound count\n\
      \        uint32 damage = baseDamage * woundCount;\n        target->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FESTERING_WOUND_DAMAGE, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the tracker maintains an internal mapping of GUIDs
    to wound counts. It is expected to be called from within the context of spell
    or aura handling logic where unit GUIDs are available. The implementation may
    rely on internal data structures such as maps or arrays indexed by GUID.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid and existing unit
    in the world. Passing an invalid or non-existent GUID might lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results depending on how the internal tracking is implemented.
