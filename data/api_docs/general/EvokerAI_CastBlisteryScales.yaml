  method: CastBlisteryScales
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastBlisteryScales(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Blistery Scales spell on the specified target.
  description: The CastBlisteryScales method is responsible for executing the Blistery
    Scales ability within the Evoker AI framework. This method takes a target parameter
    and attempts to cast the spell on that target, likely following specific conditions
    or cooldowns defined by the Evoker's behavior. The spell is typically used as
    part of the Evoker's combat strategy, dealing damage or applying debuffs to enemies.
    It may involve checking for valid targets, ensuring the spell is not on cooldown,
    and managing resource requirements such as mana or soul fragments.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier. This
      value should correspond to a valid unit in the game world that can be targeted
      by the spell.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastBlisteryScales
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      this->CastBlisteryScales(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that manages spell casting
    decisions for Evoker NPCs. It may be called from within the Evoker's main AI loop
    or in response to specific combat triggers. The target parameter must point to
    a valid game object ID; otherwise, the spell will not be cast.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the integer pointed to by 'target' refers to an existing
    unit before calling this method.
