documentation:
  brief: Updates performance profiles for bot analytics tracking
  description: The UpdatePerformanceProfiles method collects and processes current
    performance metrics from active bots within the TrinityCore environment. This
    method is responsible for gathering data such as CPU usage, memory consumption,
    and response times for each bot instance. It updates internal profiling structures
    that are used for monitoring system health, identifying performance bottlenecks,
    and optimizing bot behavior. The method typically runs periodically as part of
    the game's performance monitoring system to ensure that bot operations remain
    within acceptable resource utilization limits.

  - title: Basic Usage in Performance Monitoring Loop
    code: "void PerformanceMonitor::UpdateAllProfiles()\n{\n    sBotPerformanceAnalytics->UpdatePerformanceProfiles();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to maintain accurate performance data.
    It may have performance implications during high bot count scenarios, so it's
    recommended to schedule calls during low-traffic periods or use asynchronous execution
    patterns.
