  signature: void Player::SetArenaTeamInfoField(uint8 slot, ArenaTeamInfoType type,
    uint32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the specified arena team information field for the player at the given
    slot.
  description: This method allows setting specific arena team information fields for
    a player, including the arena team ID, rating, and other related data. It is used
    primarily in the context of arena team management within World of Warcraft's battleground
    system. The method operates on a per-slot basis, where each slot represents a
    different arena team type (2v2, 3v3, 5v5). This function is typically used during
    arena team creation or modification operations and requires proper handling of
    the arena team data structure to maintain game balance and integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The slot index representing the specific arena team type (2v2, 3v3,
      5v5). Valid values are 0-2 for the three different arena team types.
  - name: type
    description: The arena team information type to set. This specifies what field
      is being updated, such as team ID, rating, or other data fields.
  - name: value
    description: The value to set for the specified arena team information field.
      This could be an integer representing team ID, rating, or other numeric data
      depending on the type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Arena Team Rating
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetArenaTeamInfoField(0, ARENA_TEAM_RATING, 1500);

      // Sets the 2v2 arena team rating to 1500'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Arena Team ID
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetArenaTeamInfoField(1, ARENA_TEAM_ID, 12345);

      // Sets the 3v3 arena team ID to 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal arena team management system and should
    only be used when properly handling arena team data structures. It requires careful
    handling of slot indices and type values to avoid game balance issues or incorrect
    data updates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect arena team data, potentially
    causing game imbalance or player data corruption. Ensure that the slot index and
    type values are valid before calling this method.
