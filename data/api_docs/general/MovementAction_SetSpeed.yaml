  class: MovementAction
  method: SetSpeed
  signature: void MovementAction::SetSpeed(float speed)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the movement speed of the associated unit to the specified value.
  description: The SetSpeed method configures the movement speed of a unit within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method directly affects how fast the unit moves
    in the game world, whether it's a player, NPC, or creature. The speed value is
    typically expressed as a multiplier relative to the unit's base movement speed.
    Setting this value influences various aspects of gameplay including pathfinding,
    combat timing, and player experience. The method does not validate the input speed
    value, so developers should ensure that the provided speed is within reasonable
    bounds for the intended use case.
  parameters:
  - name: speed
    description: The desired movement speed as a floating-point multiplier. A value
      of 1.0 represents normal speed, values less than 1.0 slow movement, and values
      greater than 1.0 increase movement speed.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Set Normal Movement Speed
    code: 'MovementAction action;

      action.SetSpeed(1.0f); // Sets to normal speed'
    language: cpp
  - title: Increase Movement Speed
    code: 'MovementAction action;

      action.SetSpeed(1.5f); // Increases speed by 50%'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the unit's movement properties and may affect
    pathfinding calculations. It is recommended to call this method during appropriate
    AI update cycles rather than in high-frequency loops to avoid performance issues.
  warnings: Setting extremely high speed values may cause visual glitches or unexpected
    behavior in client-side rendering. Avoid setting negative speed values as they
    are not supported and may lead to undefined behavior.
