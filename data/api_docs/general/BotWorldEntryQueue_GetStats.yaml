  class: BotWorldEntryQueue
  method: GetStats
  signature: QueueStats BotWorldEntryQueue::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves current queue statistics for the bot world entry.
  description: The GetStats method returns a QueueStats object containing detailed
    information about the current state of the bot world entry queue. This includes
    metrics such as the number of bots currently in the queue, the total number of
    queued requests, average wait times, and other relevant performance indicators.
    The returned statistics are useful for monitoring and managing bot activity within
    the game environment. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe
    to call from multiple threads concurrently.
  parameters: []
  returns: A QueueStats object containing current queue metrics including bot counts,
    wait times, and processing statistics. The object provides read-only access to
    queue information without modifying the underlying data structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotWorldEntryQueue queue;

      QueueStats stats = queue.GetStats();

      std::cout << "Bots in queue: " << stats.botCount << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Queue Performance
    code: "void MonitorQueue(BotWorldEntryQueue& queue) {\n    QueueStats stats =\
      \ queue.GetStats();\n    if (stats.waitTime > 30000) { // More than 30 seconds\n\
      \        LOG_WARN(\"Bot queue is congested: %d bots waiting for %.2f seconds\"\
      , \n                 stats.botCount, stats.waitTime / 1000.0);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a thread-safe read operation on internal queue statistics.
    The returned QueueStats object is a snapshot of the current state at the time
    of the call and may not reflect real-time changes. For high-frequency monitoring,
    consider caching results or using polling intervals to avoid excessive overhead.
  warnings: The QueueStats object returned by this method should be treated as immutable.
    Modifying its contents directly will not affect the actual queue statistics. Always
    use the return value for read-only access to current queue metrics.
