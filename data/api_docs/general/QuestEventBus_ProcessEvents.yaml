  class: QuestEventBus
  method: ProcessEvents
  signature: uint32 QuestEventBus::ProcessEvents(uint32 diff, uint32 maxEvents)
documentation:
  brief: Processes queued quest events up to a specified maximum count within a given
    time delta.
  description: The ProcessEvents method is responsible for executing pending quest-related
    events that have been scheduled for execution. It iterates through the event queue,
    processing events based on their scheduled time and type. The method accepts a
    time delta (diff) to determine how much time has passed since last processing
    and a maximum number of events (maxEvents) to prevent excessive processing in
    a single call. This ensures that quest events are handled efficiently without
    blocking the main game loop for extended periods. Events may include quest start,
    completion, objective updates, or other triggers that occur during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since last event processing. Used to determine
      which events should be executed based on their scheduled timing.
  - name: maxEvents
    description: Maximum number of events to process in this call. Prevents excessive
      CPU usage by limiting batch size of event execution.
  returns: Returns the actual number of events processed during this invocation. This
    value will be less than or equal to the maxEvents parameter, depending on how
    many events were available to process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: 'uint32 processed = sQuestEventBus->ProcessEvents(diff, 100);

      // Process up to 100 quest events in this frame'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with World update cycle
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n    sQuestEventBus->ProcessEvents(diff,\
      \ 50);\n    // ... other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game update loop. The diff
    parameter should reflect the actual time elapsed since last call to maintain proper
    event timing. Events are processed in order of their scheduled execution time,
    and processing stops once maxEvents is reached or queue is empty.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very large maxEvents value can cause performance
    hiccups if many events are queued. Ensure diff parameter accurately reflects real
    elapsed time to maintain proper quest event timing.
