  signature: FormationType FormationUtils::GetOptimalFormationForCombat(const int
    & members, const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal combat formation based on group size and enemy count
  description: The GetOptimalFormationForCombat method evaluates the number of group
    members and enemies to determine the most effective combat formation for a given
    scenario. This utility function considers tactical balance, resource allocation,
    and engagement efficiency to recommend an appropriate formation type. The method
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes for player characters or NPCs
    during combat encounters. It takes into account both the defensive and offensive
    capabilities required for different combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: members
    description: The number of group members participating in combat, must be a non-negative
      integer representing active participants
  - name: enemies
    description: The number of enemy opponents in the combat scenario, must be a non-negative
      integer representing active enemies
  returns: 'Returns a FormationType enum value indicating the recommended combat formation.
    Possible values include: FORMATION_SINGLE_LINE, FORMATION_DOUBLE_LINE, FORMATION_CIRCLE,
    FORMATION_WEDGE, or FORMATION_NONE if no optimal formation can be determined.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FormationType formation = FormationUtils::GetOptimalFormationForCombat(5,
      3);

      // Returns FORMATION_WEDGE for a group of 5 vs 3 enemies'
    language: cpp
  - title: Large Group Engagement
    code: 'int members = 10;

      int enemies = 15;

      FormationType formation = FormationUtils::GetOptimalFormationForCombat(members,
      enemies);

      // Returns FORMATION_DOUBLE_LINE for larger groups facing more enemies'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and fast, making it suitable for
    real-time tactical decisions during combat. The implementation likely uses heuristics
    based on historical combat data and game balance considerations. It does not account
    for individual member abilities or specific enemy types, focusing instead on general
    group dynamics.
  warnings: The method assumes that both parameters are non-negative integers. Passing
    negative values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect formation recommendations.
    The returned formation type should be validated before use in actual combat scenarios.
