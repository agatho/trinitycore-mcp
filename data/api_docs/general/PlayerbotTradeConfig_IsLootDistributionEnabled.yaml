documentation:
  brief: Determines whether loot distribution is enabled for the player bot's trading
    behavior.
  description: The IsLootDistributionEnabled method checks if the player bot is configured
    to participate in or enable loot distribution mechanics during trade interactions.
    This setting typically controls whether the bot will automatically distribute
    loot among group members when trading items, based on configured rules such as
    need-before-greed or round-robin distribution. The method returns a boolean value
    indicating the current state of this configuration flag within the PlayerbotTradeConfig
    class.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether loot distribution is enabled (true)
    or disabled (false).
  examples:
  - title: Check if Loot Distribution is Enabled
    code: "if (playerBot->GetTradeConfig()->IsLootDistributionEnabled()) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with loot distribution logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Loot distribution\
      \ is enabled for this bot.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle case where loot distribution\
      \ is disabled\n    sLog->outString(\"Loot distribution is disabled for this\
      \ bot.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from internal configuration flags or settings stored
    in the PlayerbotTradeConfig class. It may be influenced by global server settings
    or player-specific configurations related to group loot rules.
