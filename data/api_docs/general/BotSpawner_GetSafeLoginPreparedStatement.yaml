  class: BotSpawner

  signature: int * BotSpawner::GetSafeLoginPreparedStatement(int statementId, const
    char * statementName) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a prepared statement ID for safe login operations within the BotSpawner
    class.
  description: The GetSafeLoginPreparedStatement method is responsible for returning
    a prepared statement identifier that corresponds to a specific database operation
    required during the bot login process. This method ensures that database queries
    used for authenticating and initializing bot characters are properly prepared
    and optimized for performance. It typically maps a given statement ID to an internal
    prepared statement handle, which can then be used in subsequent database operations.
    The method is part of the BotSpawner's infrastructure for managing bot character
    lifecycle and authentication within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer representing the prepared statement ID.
    The returned value should be used directly in database query execution functions
    that require a prepared statement identifier. A null return may indicate an error
    or invalid statement ID mapping, though this depends on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int* stmtId = botSpawner->GetSafeLoginPreparedStatement(1, \"BOT_LOGIN_CHECK\"\
      );\nif (stmtId != nullptr) {\n    // Use the prepared statement ID for database\
      \ query\n    // Example: CharacterDatabase.PExecute(\"SELECT * FROM bots WHERE\
      \ id = %u\", *stmtId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger prepared statement management system
    within BotSpawner. The statement IDs are probably pre-defined constants or enums
    that map to specific SQL queries in the database. Developers should ensure thread
    safety when accessing these prepared statements, especially if multiple threads
    might be handling bot logins simultaneously.
  warnings: The method signature indicates it takes two parameters (statementId and
    statementName) but the description says 'None'. This discrepancy suggests either
    an error in documentation or a misrepresentation of the actual API. The return
    type is int* which may lead to confusion if developers expect an integer directly
    rather than a pointer to one.
