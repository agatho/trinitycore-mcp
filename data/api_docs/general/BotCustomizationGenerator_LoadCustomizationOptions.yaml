  method: LoadCustomizationOptions
  signature: void BotCustomizationGenerator::LoadCustomizationOptions(uint8 race,
    uint8 gender)
documentation:
  brief: Loads customization options for bot characters based on race and gender.
  description: The LoadCustomizationOptions method initializes and prepares available
    customization data for bot characters within the TrinityCore framework. It retrieves
    and stores valid appearance options such as facial features, hair styles, and
    skin tones that are appropriate for the specified race and gender. This method
    is typically invoked during bot creation or when updating a bot's visual representation
    to ensure consistency with game rules and player expectations. The loaded options
    are used by the bot AI system to generate visually plausible character appearances.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The racial type of the bot character (e.g., Human = 1, Orc = 2, Dwarf
      = 3, etc.). Must be a valid race ID defined in the game's database.
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the bot character (0 = Male, 1 = Female). Must be either
      0 or 1.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Load customization options for a human female bot
    code: 'BotCustomizationGenerator generator;

      generator.LoadCustomizationOptions(RACE_HUMAN, GENDER_FEMALE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Load customization options dynamically based on bot configuration
    code: 'uint8 race = bot->getRace();

      uint8 gender = bot->getGender();

      generator.LoadCustomizationOptions(race, gender);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal databases or lookup tables containing
    valid customization data for each race-gender combination. It may cache results
    to improve performance during repeated calls. The method assumes that the provided
    race and gender values are valid and within expected ranges.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid race or gender parameters may result
    in undefined behavior or incomplete customization data. Ensure that race and gender
    values correspond to valid entries in the game's character creation system.
