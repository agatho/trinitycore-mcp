  brief: Handles player name query requests from clients, responding with player information.
  description: The HandleQueryPlayerNames method processes incoming player name query
    packets sent by clients. It retrieves and responds with detailed player information
    including GUIDs, names, and status flags for requested players. This method is
    part of the WorldSession's packet handling system and typically invoked when a
    client requests information about specific players in the game world. The method
    ensures proper validation of the incoming query data and handles both single and
    multiple player name requests. It integrates with the core TrinityCore database
    and authentication systems to provide accurate player data responses.

  notes: This method operates within the WorldSession context and is typically invoked
    as part of the packet processing pipeline. It requires proper authentication and
    authorization checks before processing queries. The method may involve database
    lookups which could impact performance under high load conditions.
  warnings: Improper handling of player name queries can lead to information disclosure
    vulnerabilities. Ensure that query results respect privacy settings and access
    controls. This method should not be called directly without proper session validation.
