  method: ScheduleBot
  signature: void BotScheduler::ScheduleBot(int guid, const std::string & patternName)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules a bot for execution based on a given GUID and pattern name.
  description: The ScheduleBot method is responsible for adding a bot to the execution
    queue within the BotScheduler system. It takes a unique identifier (GUID) representing
    the bot and a pattern name that defines how the bot should be scheduled or executed.
    This method is typically used in automated bot management systems where bots need
    to be triggered according to specific patterns or schedules. The method does not
    return any value, indicating it performs an action rather than computing a result.
    It's expected that the GUID corresponds to a valid bot instance and the pattern
    name refers to a pre-defined execution pattern within the system.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be scheduled. This value
      must correspond to an existing bot instance in the system.
  - name: patternName
    description: A string representing the name of the pattern that defines how the
      bot should be scheduled or executed. This pattern must exist within the scheduler's
      configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Scheduling
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.ScheduleBot(12345, "daily_quest_pattern");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Scheduling Multiple Bots with Different Patterns
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.ScheduleBot(1001, "morning_routine");

      scheduler.ScheduleBot(1002, "evening_cleanup");

      scheduler.ScheduleBot(1003, "weekly_maintenance");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures such as queues
    or maps to manage bot scheduling. It may perform validation checks on the GUID
    and pattern name before adding the bot to the schedule. The actual execution of
    scheduled bots is handled by a separate dispatcher or worker thread.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an active bot instance, otherwise
    the method might fail silently or cause undefined behavior. Similarly, make sure
    the patternName exists in the system's configuration to avoid runtime errors.
