  brief: Finalizes a spell script call by cleaning up resources and completing execution
    flow.
  description: The _FinishScriptCall method is an internal utility function within
    the SpellScript class that handles the finalization of a spell script execution.
    It ensures proper cleanup of temporary data, resets internal state variables,
    and prepares the script context for potential reuse or destruction. This method
    is typically invoked at the end of a spell script's execution cycle to maintain
    memory integrity and prevent resource leaks. The function does not accept any
    parameters and performs no direct return operations, as its primary purpose is
    to manage the lifecycle of the script execution rather than produce results.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Script Context
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleEffect(SpellEffIndex\
      \ effIndex) override\n    {\n        // Perform some spell effect logic\n  \
      \      if (effIndex == EFFECT_0)\n        {\n            // ... effect implementation\
      \ ...\n        }\n        _FinishScriptCall(); // Finalize the script call\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use within the TrinityCore framework
    and should not be called directly by custom spell scripts. It's typically invoked
    automatically by the core spell execution engine after a spell script has completed
    its processing. Developers should understand that this function manages critical
    cleanup operations, including potential memory deallocation and state reset.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke _FinishScriptCall() in custom spell implementations
    unless you fully understand the internal mechanics of the SpellScript lifecycle.
    Improper usage can lead to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or incomplete
    script execution.
