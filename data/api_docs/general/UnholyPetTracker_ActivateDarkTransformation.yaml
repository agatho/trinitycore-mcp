documentation:
  brief: Activates the dark transformation ability for an unholy pet.
  description: The ActivateDarkTransformation method enables the dark transformation
    effect on an unholy pet, typically used in the context of Death Knight specialization.
    This method likely triggers visual effects, applies status changes, and may modify
    the pet's behavior or stats. The activation usually consumes resources such as
    runes or energy and can only be performed when the pet is in a valid state for
    transformation. It is generally part of a larger combat or ability system within
    the TrinityCore framework.

    code: "UnholyPetTracker* tracker = player->GetUnholyPetTracker();\nif (tracker)\n\
      {\n    tracker->ActivateDarkTransformation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the pet is active and in a valid state
    for transformation. It may require specific conditions such as sufficient resource
    availability or pet state validation before execution.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying the pet's readiness can lead to
    undefined behavior or client/server desynchronization in multiplayer environments.
