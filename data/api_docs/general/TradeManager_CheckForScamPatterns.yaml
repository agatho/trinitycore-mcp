documentation:
  brief: Checks for known scam patterns in the current trade transaction
  description: The CheckForScamPatterns method analyzes the current trade state to
    detect potential fraudulent activities or suspicious trading behaviors. It examines
    both parties' inventory, item values, and trade conditions against a database
    of known scam indicators. This method is typically called during trade validation
    to prevent exploitation of the trading system by players attempting to scam others
    through invalid trades.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if scam patterns are detected, false otherwise. A positive
    result indicates that the trade should be flagged or rejected based on predefined
    scam detection rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Validation
    code: "if (!tradeManager.CheckForScamPatterns()) {\n    // Proceed with trade\n\
      \    tradeManager.AcceptTrade();\n} else {\n    // Cancel trade and notify players\n\
      \    tradeManager.CancelTrade();\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Trade cancelled due\
      \ to suspicious activity.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses a combination of item value ratios, rare item distribution
    patterns, and historical trade data to identify potentially fraudulent trades.
    It may be called multiple times during a trade process for different validation
    stages.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the proper trade validation context
    as it may access uninitialized or invalid trade state information. The method
    assumes that both parties' inventories are properly loaded and accessible.
