  signature: Creature * NPCInteractionManager::FindNearestInnkeeper() const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a pointer to the nearest innkeeper creature within the
    player's current map.
  description: The FindNearestInnkeeper method searches for the closest creature that
    is classified as an innkeeper within the same map as the calling NPCInteractionManager
    instance. This method is typically used in quest or interaction logic where a
    player needs to find a nearby inn to rest, store items, or access other inn-related
    services. The search considers only creatures that are flagged as innkeepers in
    the game database and are within the current map's boundaries. If no innkeeper
    is found in the vicinity, the method returns nullptr. This function does not perform
    any distance checks beyond what is defined by the game's internal creature positioning
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a Creature object representing the nearest innkeeper on the
    current map, or nullptr if no innkeeper is found within the valid search area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in NPC interaction
    code: "Creature* innkeeper = interactionManager->FindNearestInnkeeper();\nif (innkeeper)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with innkeeper interaction\n    player->GetSession()->SendNPCDialogCreate(innkeeper->GetGUID(),\
      \ 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal creature positioning and flags system
    of TrinityCore. It may not return creatures that are technically within range
    but are marked as non-interactable or are in a different phase. Performance is
    generally low as it iterates through creatures in the current map, so avoid calling
    this frequently in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: The method returns a raw pointer to a Creature object which may become
    invalid if the creature is despawned or removed from the world. Always verify
    that the returned pointer is not null before using it and ensure proper lifetime
    management of the creature reference.
