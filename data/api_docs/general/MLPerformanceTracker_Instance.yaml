documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the MLPerformanceTracker class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the MLPerformanceTracker
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the performance tracking utility exists
    throughout the application lifecycle. This method is typically used to access
    global performance monitoring capabilities within the TrinityCore framework. The
    returned reference provides access to all performance tracking functionality including
    metric collection, reporting, and analysis tools. This implementation is thread-safe
    and designed for high-frequency access during game loop execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single MLPerformanceTracker instance. The reference
    is guaranteed to be valid and should not be null under normal operating conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Performance Tracker
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker& tracker = MLPerformanceTracker::Instance();

      tracker.LogPerformanceMetric("UpdateLoop", 15.3f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Instance for Performance Monitoring
    code: 'auto& perfTracker = MLPerformanceTracker::Instance();

      perfTracker.StartTiming("PlayerMovement");

      // ... movement logic ...

      perfTracker.EndTiming("PlayerMovement");

      perfTracker.ReportMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses a static local variable approach for singleton implementation
    which is thread-safe in C++11 and later. The instance is created on first access
    and persists for the lifetime of the application. Performance tracking data is
    typically aggregated and can be queried through other methods of the class.
  warnings: While this is a singleton pattern, avoid storing references to the instance
    across different scopes or lifetimes as it may lead to undefined behavior if the
    application shuts down before the reference is used. The performance tracking
    features should not be used in performance-critical code paths without considering
    potential overhead.
