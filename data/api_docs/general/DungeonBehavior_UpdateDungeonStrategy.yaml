  method: UpdateDungeonStrategy
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::UpdateDungeonStrategy(Group * group, EncounterStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the dungeon strategy for a given group based on encounter strategy.
  description: The UpdateDungeonStrategy method modifies or initializes the strategic
    behavior of a dungeon group according to the specified encounter strategy. This
    method is typically invoked during dungeon encounters to adjust group tactics,
    positioning, or AI decision-making processes. It allows the dungeon system to
    dynamically respond to different combat scenarios and enemy behaviors. The method
    operates on the provided Group object and applies changes based on the EncounterStrategy
    parameter which defines how the group should behave during the encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose dungeon strategy will be updated.
      Must not be null.
  - name: strategy
    description: EncounterStrategy enum value that defines the strategic behavior
      to apply to the group during dungeon encounters.
  returns: No return value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UpdateDungeonStrategy
    code: 'Group* dungeonGroup = player->GetGroup();

      EncounterStrategy strategy = ENCOUNTER_STRATEGY_NORMAL;

      DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.UpdateDungeonStrategy(dungeonGroup, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating strategy for a specific encounter type
    code: "if (encounterType == BOSS_ENCOUNTER)\n{\n    EncounterStrategy strategy\
      \ = ENCOUNTER_STRATEGY_BOSS;\n    dungeonBehavior.UpdateDungeonStrategy(player->GetGroup(),\
      \ strategy);\n}\nelse\n{\n    EncounterStrategy strategy = ENCOUNTER_STRATEGY_NORMAL;\n\
      \    dungeonBehavior.UpdateDungeonStrategy(player->GetGroup(), strategy);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the dungeon AI system and should only be called when
    a group enters or transitions into a new encounter state. The method may modify
    internal group AI states and should not be called during critical sections where
    group integrity is important.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior. This method modifies
    the group's strategic behavior directly, so it should only be used when appropriate
    encounter conditions are met.
