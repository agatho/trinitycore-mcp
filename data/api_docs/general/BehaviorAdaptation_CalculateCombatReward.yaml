documentation:
  brief: Calculates combat reward based on damage dealt and taken by a player bot
  description: The CalculateCombatReward method computes a reward value for a player
    bot based on the amount of damage it has dealt and received during combat. This
    method is typically used in AI behavior systems to determine rewards for bot actions,
    which can be utilized for reinforcement learning or behavior adaptation mechanisms.
    The calculation considers both offensive and defensive contributions to determine
    an overall combat performance score that influences future decision-making.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot performing combat
      actions
  - name: damageDealt
    description: Float value representing total damage dealt by the bot during combat
  - name: damageTaken
    description: Float value representing total damage taken by the bot during combat
  returns: A float value representing the calculated combat reward, typically used
    for AI behavior adjustment or learning algorithms
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float reward = behaviorAdaptation->CalculateCombatReward(playerBot, 150.0f,\
      \ 75.0f);\n// Use reward for reinforcement learning\nif (reward > 0) {\n   \
      \ // Positive reward indicates good combat performance\n    playerBot->GetAI()->OnSuccessfulCombat();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using reward to adjust bot behavior
    code: "float damageDealt = playerBot->GetTotalDamageDealt();\nfloat damageTaken\
      \ = playerBot->GetTotalDamageTaken();\nfloat combatReward = behaviorAdaptation->CalculateCombatReward(playerBot,\
      \ damageDealt, damageTaken);\n\nif (combatReward > 10.0f) {\n    // Increase\
      \ aggression for next combat round\n    playerBot->SetAggressionLevel(playerBot->GetAggressionLevel()\
      \ + 0.1f);\n} else if (combatReward < -5.0f) {\n    // Reduce aggression due\
      \ to poor performance\n    playerBot->SetAggressionLevel(playerBot->GetAggressionLevel()\
      \ - 0.1f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a reinforcement learning system where combat
    rewards influence bot behavior adaptation. The exact reward calculation algorithm
    is not specified in the signature, but it probably weights damage dealt more heavily
    than damage taken to encourage offensive behavior while still considering survivability.
  warnings: Ensure that the player bot pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method. The damage values should be positive floats representing actual combat
    statistics from the current combat session.
