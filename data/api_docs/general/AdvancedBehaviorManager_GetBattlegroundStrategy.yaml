  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: GetBattlegroundStrategy
  signature: BattlegroundStrategy * AdvancedBehaviorManager::GetBattlegroundStrategy(BattlegroundType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battleground strategy associated with the specified battleground
    type.
  description: The GetBattlegroundStrategy method is used to fetch a specific BattlegroundStrategy
    object that defines the behavior and logic for a given battleground type. This
    method is typically invoked during battleground initialization or when determining
    how AI units should behave in different battleground scenarios. The returned strategy
    object contains rules, objectives, and tactical guidelines that govern gameplay
    mechanics such as capture point handling, team coordination, and objective prioritization.
    It's important to note that this method assumes a valid battleground type has
    been passed and will return a null pointer if the specified type does not have
    an associated strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The BattlegroundType enum value identifying which battleground strategy
      to retrieve. Valid values include all defined battleground types such as BG_TYPE_AV,
      BG_TYPE_WS, BG_TYPE_AB, etc.
  returns: A pointer to the BattlegroundStrategy object for the specified battleground
    type. Returns nullptr if no strategy exists for the given type or if the input
    parameter is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BattlegroundStrategy* strategy = sAdvancedBehaviorManager->GetBattlegroundStrategy(BG_TYPE_AV);\n\
      if (strategy)\n{\n    // Use the strategy for AI decision making\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy Validation
    code: "BattlegroundType bgType = BG_TYPE_WS;\nBattlegroundStrategy* strategy =\
      \ sAdvancedBehaviorManager->GetBattlegroundStrategy(bgType);\nif (strategy !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Proceed with using the strategy\n    strategy->Initialize();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle missing strategy case\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"bg\", \"\
      No strategy found for battleground type %u\", bgType);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AdvancedBehaviorManager class which handles complex
    AI behaviors in battlegrounds. The returned BattlegroundStrategy objects are usually
    pre-configured and managed internally by the system. Developers should not modify
    these strategies directly as they are designed to be immutable once loaded.
  warnings: Always check for null return values when calling this method, as invalid
    battleground types may result in a nullptr being returned. Additionally, do not
    assume that all battleground types have associated strategies; some custom or
    unsupported types might not be handled.
