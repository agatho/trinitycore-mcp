documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new AuctionsBucketKey instance configured for commodity
    auctions.
  description: The ForCommodity method is a static factory function that constructs
    and initializes an AuctionsBucketKey object specifically designed for handling
    commodity-based auction entries. This method is typically used within the auction
    house system to categorize and manage auctions for items that are classified as
    commodities, which often include resources, crafting materials, and other tradeable
    goods. The returned AuctionsBucketKey instance encapsulates the necessary metadata
    and identifiers required to properly bucket and retrieve these commodity auctions
    from the auction database or cache. This method ensures proper initialization
    of internal state variables specific to commodity auctions, such as item type
    flags, category mappings, and sorting criteria.
  parameters: []
  returns: An initialized AuctionsBucketKey object configured for commodity auctions.
    The returned object can be used directly in auction bucketing operations or passed
    to other methods that require commodity-specific auction key structures.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Commodity Auction Bucket Key
    code: 'const int* itemTemplate = GetItemTemplate(12345);

      AuctionsBucketKey bucketKey = AuctionsBucketKey::ForCommodity(itemTemplate);

      // Use bucketKey for auction operations

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the auction house subsystem and assumes that the input
    item template represents a valid commodity type. The implementation likely caches
    or pre-computes certain values for performance optimization when dealing with
    frequent commodity auction queries.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided itemTemplate parameter points to a valid item
    entry that is actually classified as a commodity, otherwise the resulting AuctionsBucketKey
    may not behave correctly in auction operations. This method should only be called
    from contexts where the auction system is properly initialized.
