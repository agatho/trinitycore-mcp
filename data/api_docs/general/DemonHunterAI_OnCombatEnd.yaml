documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and state reset operations when Demon Hunter combat ends
  description: The OnCombatEnd method is called when a Demon Hunter AI character exits
    combat mode. This method handles necessary cleanup tasks such as resetting combat-related
    flags, clearing target information, and ensuring the AI returns to its default
    non-combat state. The method is typically invoked by the core game engine when
    the demon hunter's combat timer expires or when all enemies are defeated. It ensures
    proper state management for the AI behavior system and prepares the demon hunter
    for subsequent encounters or idle states.

  - title: Basic usage in custom AI implementation
    code: "class MyDemonHunterAI : public DemonHunterAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatEnd()\
      \ override {\n        // Call parent implementation\n        DemonHunterAI::OnCombatEnd();\n\
      \        \n        // Custom cleanup logic\n        ResetSpecialAbilities();\n\
      \        SetIsInCombat(false);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the TrinityCore framework during combat
    state transitions. Developers should ensure that any custom implementations call
    the base class implementation to maintain proper AI behavior. The method does
    not accept any parameters and should be implemented as a virtual override in derived
    classes.
