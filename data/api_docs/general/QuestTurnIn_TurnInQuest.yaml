  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: TurnInQuest
  signature: bool QuestTurnIn::TurnInQuest(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to turn in a specified quest for a player character, returning true
    on success.
  description: The TurnInQuest method is responsible for processing the completion
    of a quest for a given player character. It validates whether the player has met
    all requirements to complete the quest, including necessary items, kills, or objectives.
    If all conditions are satisfied, the method will reward the player with experience,
    gold, and any associated quest items or choices. The method returns true if the
    quest was successfully turned in and rewards were distributed; otherwise, it returns
    false. This function is typically used by AI systems or automated quest completion
    mechanisms within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be turned in. Must correspond
      to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character attempting
      to turn in the quest. Must not be null and must be a valid player instance.
  returns: Returns true if the quest was successfully turned in and all rewards were
    processed. Returns false if the quest could not be completed due to missing requirements,
    invalid player state, or other errors during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In
    code: "if (questTurnIn->TurnInQuest(12345, player)) {\n    // Quest turned in\
      \ successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Quest 12345 completed.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to turn in quest\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to complete quest\
      \ 12345.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Quest Completion Before Turn-In
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Valid player instance\n\
      if (player->GetQuestStatus(questId) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE) {\n    if (questTurnIn->TurnInQuest(questId,\
      \ player)) {\n        sLog->outString(\"Quest %u turned in successfully.\",\
      \ questId);\n    } else {\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed to turn in quest\
      \ %u.\", questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calls various core TrinityCore systems including quest
    validation, reward distribution, and player state updates. It assumes that all
    preconditions for quest completion have already been checked by the calling code.
    The method does not perform any additional checks beyond basic quest validity
    and reward processing.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null player pointer or an invalid quest
    ID. Calling TurnInQuest on a quest that has not been completed or is not in the
    correct state may lead to inconsistent game state or unexpected behavior. This
    function should only be used when you are certain that the player can legitimately
    complete the quest.
