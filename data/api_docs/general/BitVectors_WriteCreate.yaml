documentation:
  brief: Writes bit vector data to a ByteBuffer for player creation packet
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes bit vector data into a ByteBuffer,
    typically used when constructing player creation packets sent to clients. This
    method is responsible for encoding the necessary bit flags and data structures
    that define a player's initial state in the game world. The method takes ownership
    of the data serialization process and writes it to the provided ByteBuffer, which
    is then sent over the network to the specified receiver player. It uses both the
    owner (the player whose data is being serialized) and receiver (the player who
    will receive the packet) parameters to determine proper serialization behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized bit vector data will
      be written
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose bit vector data is being serialized
      (can be null)
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this packet (can be
      null)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player creation
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // some player

      Player* receiver = ...; // receiving player

      BitVectors bitVecs;

      bitVecs.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during packet construction for player-related
    network messages. The implementation may vary based on the specific bit vector
    configuration and player state being serialized. It's important to ensure that
    both owner and receiver parameters are valid pointers before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers for owner or receiver may lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure proper initialization of all player objects before
    serialization.
