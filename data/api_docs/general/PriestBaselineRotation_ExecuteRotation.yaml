  class: PriestBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool PriestBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target,
    BaselineRotationManager & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the baseline priest rotation logic for a bot targeting a specified
    enemy.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method implements the core decision-making logic
    for a baseline priest AI behavior. It evaluates the current combat state, available
    spells, and target conditions to determine the appropriate action to take. The
    method utilizes the provided bot and target pointers along with a rotation manager
    to make intelligent casting decisions. This function is typically called during
    the AI update cycle and returns true if a valid action was executed, or false
    if no suitable action could be determined. The rotation logic considers factors
    such as mana levels, spell cooldowns, and combat priorities to ensure optimal
    gameplay performance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot's player data structure containing current state
      information including health, mana, and available spells.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target enemy's player data structure containing health,
      position, and status effects information.
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager that handles rotation state
      tracking, spell priority queues, and cooldown management.
  returns: Returns true if a valid spell or action was successfully executed during
    this rotation cycle. Returns false if no suitable action could be determined or
    if the bot is in an invalid state for casting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botData[10];\nint targetData[10];\nBaselineRotationManager manager;\n\
      \n// Initialize bot and target data\n// ... (data setup) ...\n\nbool result\
      \ = rotation.ExecuteRotation(botData, targetData, manager);\nif (result)\n{\n\
      \    // Action was executed successfully\n    printf(\"Priest performed an action\\\
      n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No action taken\n    printf(\"No valid action available\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Loop
    code: "void UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (IsInCombat())\n    {\n        int* bot = GetBotData();\n\
      \        int* target = GetTargetData();\n        BaselineRotationManager& manager\
      \ = GetRotationManager();\n        \n        if (!rotation.ExecuteRotation(bot,\
      \ target, manager))\n        {\n            // Fallback behavior when no rotation\
      \ action is available\n            MoveToTarget();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot and target data structures are properly
    initialized before calling. The BaselineRotationManager must be correctly configured
    with spell priorities and cooldown information for optimal performance. Performance
    considerations include minimizing memory allocations during execution and avoiding
    expensive operations within the rotation loop.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without ensuring that both bot and target
    pointers are valid. The method may cause undefined behavior if either pointer
    is null or points to invalid memory. Avoid calling this in high-frequency loops
    without proper rate limiting to prevent excessive CPU usage.
