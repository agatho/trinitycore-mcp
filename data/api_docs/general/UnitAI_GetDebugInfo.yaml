documentation:
  brief: Retrieves debug information integer value from the UnitAI instance.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method is a const member function of the UnitAI class
    that returns an integer representing internal debug state or configuration flags
    for the AI system. This method is typically used for debugging purposes to inspect
    the current AI behavior or internal state without modifying it. The returned value
    may represent various debug levels, AI mode indicators, or bitmask flags depending
    on the implementation within TrinityCore's AI framework. It does not perform any
    side effects and can be safely called during gameplay or in debug contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing debug information for the UnitAI instance.
    The specific meaning of this integer depends on the internal implementation and
    may vary based on AI mode, debug level, or state flags.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Info Retrieval
    code: "UnitAI* ai = creature->GetAI();\nint debugInfo = ai->GetDebugInfo();\n\
      if (debugInfo != 0)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Creature AI debug info: %d\",\
      \ debugInfo);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is marked as const, meaning it does not modify the object's state.
    It should be used primarily in debugging scenarios or when inspecting AI behavior
    without affecting gameplay. The exact interpretation of the returned integer value
    may vary between different AI implementations within TrinityCore.
