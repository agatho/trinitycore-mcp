  brief: Initializes the set of spells available to the pet at a specific level.
  description: The InitLevelupSpellsForLevel method sets up the spell list for a pet
    based on its current level. This method is typically invoked during pet creation
    or level-up events to ensure that the pet has access to appropriate spells for
    its development stage. It handles the assignment of level-specific spells and
    ensures proper synchronization with the pet's spellbook. The method operates within
    the context of World of Warcraft's pet system, where different pets have unique
    spell progression patterns based on their type and level.
