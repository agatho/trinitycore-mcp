  method: GetSpawnTrackingStateByObjective
  signature: SpawnTrackingState Player::GetSpawnTrackingStateByObjective(uint32 spawnTrackingId,
    uint32 questObjectiveId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spawn tracking state for a specific objective within a quest.
  description: This method retrieves the current spawn tracking state associated with
    a given spawn tracking ID and quest objective ID. It is used to determine whether
    a player has completed or is in progress of completing a tracked spawn objective,
    such as killing a specific mob or interacting with an object during a quest. The
    returned SpawnTrackingState indicates the status of this tracking, which may be
    used for quest progression, UI updates, or other game logic that depends on spawn-based
    objectives. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters:
  - name: spawnTrackingId
    description: Unique identifier for the spawn tracking entry. This ID typically
      corresponds to a specific tracked object or NPC in the world, such as a quest-giver
      or a mob that must be killed.
  - name: questObjectiveId
    description: Identifier of the specific quest objective within the quest that
      uses this spawn tracking. This allows distinguishing between multiple objectives
      in the same quest that might use the same spawn tracking ID.
  returns: 'Returns a SpawnTrackingState enum value indicating the current state of
    the spawn tracking for the given objective. Possible values may include: TRACKING_INCOMPLETE,
    TRACKING_COMPLETE, or TRACKING_INVALID depending on how the tracking system is
    implemented and what has occurred in the player''s quest progress.'
  examples:
  - title: Check Spawn Tracking State for a Quest Objective
    code: "uint32 trackingId = 12345;\nuint32 objectiveId = 67890;\nSpawnTrackingState\
      \ state = player->GetSpawnTrackingStateByObjective(trackingId, objectiveId);\n\
      if (state == TRACKING_COMPLETE)\n{\n    // Quest objective is complete\n   \
      \ player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the spawn tracking and quest objective IDs are valid
    and have been properly initialized in the database or quest system. The behavior
    may vary depending on how the SpawnTrackingState enum is defined internally, so
    developers should refer to the core codebase for exact values.
  warnings: Ensure that both spawnTrackingId and questObjectiveId are valid before
    calling this method; otherwise, unexpected results or crashes might occur. This
    method does not perform any validation of these IDs internally.
