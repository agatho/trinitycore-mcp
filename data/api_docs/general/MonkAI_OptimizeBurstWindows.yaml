documentation:
  brief: Optimizes burst windows for Monk AI by evaluating and adjusting combat timing
    strategies.
  description: The OptimizeBurstWindows method in the MonkAI class is responsible
    for dynamically analyzing current combat conditions and adjusting the timing of
    burst damage abilities to maximize effectiveness. This method evaluates factors
    such as enemy health percentages, available resources like energy or chi, and
    optimal window conditions for high-damage spells. It ensures that the monk's offensive
    capabilities are utilized efficiently during peak damage windows while maintaining
    proper resource management. The method is typically called during combat updates
    to adapt the AI's strategy based on evolving battlefield conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void MyMonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n \
      \   OptimizeBurstWindows();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core combat decision-making system for Monk AI
    and should be called regularly during combat updates. It does not directly execute
    actions but rather prepares internal state for optimal burst timing decisions.
