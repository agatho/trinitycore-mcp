  signature: int AuctionHouse::FindFlipOpportunities(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes auction house listings to identify potential profit opportunities
    by comparing buyout prices with item values.
  description: The FindFlipOpportunities method scans the auction house database for
    items that could potentially be flipped for a profit. It evaluates current auction
    listings, compares their buyout prices against estimated item values or market
    rates, and identifies opportunities where an item can be purchased at a lower
    price and sold at a higher price. This method is typically used by players or
    automated systems to find profitable trading opportunities within the game's economy.
    The method may consider factors such as item rarity, demand, and current market
    trends when determining flip potential.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID or GUID who is performing
      the analysis. This parameter allows the method to track which player initiated
      the search for flip opportunities.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the number of profitable flip opportunities
    found. A return value of 0 indicates no opportunities were identified, while a
    positive integer represents the count of potential flips. Negative values may
    indicate errors or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nint flipCount = auctionHouse->FindFlipOpportunities(&playerId);\n\
      if (flipCount > 0) {\n    printf(\"Found %d profitable flip opportunities\\\
      n\", flipCount);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No profitable flips found\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerId = 0;\nint result = auctionHouse->FindFlipOpportunities(&playerId);\n\
      if (result < 0) {\n    printf(\"Error occurred during flip analysis\\n\");\n\
      } else if (result == 0) {\n    printf(\"No profitable opportunities available\
      \ at this time\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Found %d potential profit opportunities\\\
      n\", result);\n    // Process the identified flips\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries against auction house records
    and may have performance implications when processing large numbers of items.
    The accuracy of flip opportunities depends on the quality of item valuation algorithms
    and current market data. Implementation details may vary based on how the auction
    house system tracks item values and calculates profit margins.
  warnings: The method may return inaccurate results if item valuations are outdated
    or if market conditions change rapidly. Using this method in high-frequency trading
    scenarios could potentially lead to performance issues or be flagged by anti-cheat
    systems. Always validate that player IDs are valid before passing them to this
    method.
