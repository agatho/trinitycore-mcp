  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: TeleportPlayerToDungeon
  signature: bool LFGGroupCoordinator::TeleportPlayerToDungeon(Player * player, uint32
    dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports a player to a specified dungeon location.
  description: The TeleportPlayerToDungeon method is responsible for moving a Player
    object to a designated dungeon instance within the World of Warcraft environment.
    This function is typically invoked as part of the LFG (Looking For Group) system's
    coordination process, ensuring that players are properly transported to their
    assigned dungeon areas. The method handles the necessary game state transitions
    and teleportation mechanics required for group dungeon entry. It verifies the
    validity of the dungeon ID and player state before initiating the teleportation
    sequence.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that will be teleported to the dungeon.
      Must not be null and must represent a valid player in the game world.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: The unique identifier for the dungeon instance to which the player
      will be teleported. This ID corresponds to entries in the game's dungeon database
      and determines the specific dungeon location and instance data.
  returns: Returns true if the teleportation was successfully initiated and the player
    is being moved to the dungeon; returns false if the operation failed due to invalid
    parameters, player state issues, or other teleportation errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dungeon Teleport
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 dungeonId = 1234;\nLFGGroupCoordinator coordinator;\n\
      bool success = coordinator.TeleportPlayerToDungeon(player, dungeonId);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Player has been teleported\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Teleportation failed\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system's internal coordination logic and should
    only be called when a player is properly registered in an LFG group. The actual
    teleportation process may involve multiple steps including instance creation,
    position validation, and potential group synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper LFG group registration or with invalid
    dungeon IDs can result in unexpected behavior or client-side errors. Ensure that
    the player is in a valid state before invoking this function.
