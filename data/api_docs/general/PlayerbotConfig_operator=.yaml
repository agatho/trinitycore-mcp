  class: PlayerbotConfig
  method: operator=
  signature: PlayerbotConfig & PlayerbotConfig::operator=(const PlayerbotConfig &
    param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns all configuration values from another PlayerbotConfig instance to
    this instance.
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy of all configuration parameters
    from the source PlayerbotConfig object to the current object. This assignment
    operator ensures that all internal settings, including bot behavior flags, strategy
    configurations, and miscellaneous options, are fully transferred. It is commonly
    used when updating a player's bot configuration with new settings or when cloning
    an existing configuration for modification. The method returns a reference to
    the current object to allow for chaining assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source PlayerbotConfig object whose values will be copied to
      this instance.
  returns: A reference to the current PlayerbotConfig object after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'PlayerbotConfig config1;

      PlayerbotConfig config2 = config1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      config2 = config1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Assignments
    code: 'PlayerbotConfig configA, configB, configC;

      configA = configB = configC; // Chained assignment

      // Equivalent to:

      configB = configC;

      configA = configB;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy to ensure that internal data
    structures are properly duplicated. In the context of TrinityCore's playerbot
    system, this method is essential for managing bot configurations across different
    players or sessions without cross-contamination of settings.
