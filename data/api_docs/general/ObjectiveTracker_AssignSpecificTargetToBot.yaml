  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: AssignSpecificTargetToBot
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::AssignSpecificTargetToBot(Player * bot, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex, uint32 targetIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a specific target to a bot for a given quest objective.
  description: The AssignSpecificTargetToBot method configures a bot player to focus
    on a particular target associated with a specified quest objective. This function
    is typically used in automated quest completion systems or AI-driven gameplay
    mechanics where bots need to track and interact with specific game objects or
    NPCs related to ongoing quests. The assignment ensures that the bot's behavior
    aligns with the quest requirements by directing it toward the correct target based
    on the provided index.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be assigned
      the target.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the target is being assigned.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index of the specific objective within the quest that requires a
      target assignment.
  - name: targetIndex
    description: Index of the target within the specified quest objective to assign
      to the bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Target Assignment
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      ObjectiveTracker::AssignSpecificTargetToBot(myBot, 12345, 0, 2);

      // Assigns the third target (index 2) of the first objective (index 0) for quest
      ID 12345 to myBot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest tracking systems and may
    require that the bot has an active quest session. It is intended for use in AI
    or automation scripts within TrinityCore's framework.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided indices are valid for the specified quest; invalid
    indices could lead to undefined behavior or failed assignments.
