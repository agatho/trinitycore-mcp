documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the quest manager for the specified bot AI instance.
  description: The ShutdownQuestManager method is responsible for gracefully terminating
    and cleaning up the quest management system associated with a specific BotAI instance.
    This function ensures that any active quest states, quest-related data structures,
    and associated resources are properly released to prevent memory leaks or undefined
    behavior. It typically gets called during bot AI shutdown or cleanup processes
    to ensure proper resource deallocation and system stability.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance whose quest manager needs to be shut
      down. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: "BotAI* botAI = sBotAI->GetBotAI(playerGuid);\nif (botAI)\n{\n    sBotAI->ShutdownQuestManager(botAI);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the BotAI instance is no longer needed
    or during system shutdown. Calling this method on an already shut down quest manager
    may lead to undefined behavior.
