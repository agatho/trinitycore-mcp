  brief: Handles summoning of creatures or object types during spell effects
  description: The EffectSummonType method in TrinityCore's Spell class is responsible
    for managing the summoning behavior when a spell effect requires the creation
    of summoned creatures or objects. This method typically handles various summoning
    types including summoning of pets, companions, vehicles, or other game objects
    based on the spell's parameters and context. It plays a crucial role in determining
    how summoned entities are created and positioned within the game world.

  - title: Basic Summon Type Handling
    code: "void Spell::EffectSummonType()\n{\n    // Implementation for summoning\
      \ types\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell effect handling system and typically involves
    complex logic related to summoning mechanics, including positioning, faction relationships,
    and object creation. It may be called multiple times during a single spell execution
    depending on the spell's design.
  warnings: Improper implementation can lead to incorrect summoning behavior or game
    objects not being created properly, potentially causing client-side issues or
    server-side inconsistencies.
