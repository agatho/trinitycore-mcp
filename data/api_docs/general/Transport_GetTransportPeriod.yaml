  method: GetTransportPeriod
  signature: int Transport::GetTransportPeriod() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the transport period of the transport in milliseconds.
  description: The GetTransportPeriod method retrieves the periodic movement duration
    of a transport object, which defines how long it takes for the transport to complete
    one full cycle of its movement path. This value is crucial for calculating the
    transport's position at any given time and is used internally by the game engine
    to manage passenger positioning and synchronization. The returned value represents
    the total time in milliseconds for one complete transport cycle, including all
    stops and transitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the transport period in milliseconds. This
    indicates the duration of one full movement cycle for the transport object.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve transport period for debugging
    code: "Transport* transport = player->GetTransport();\nif (transport)\n{\n   \
      \ int period = transport->GetTransportPeriod();\n    sLog->outString(\"Transport\
      \ period: %d ms\", period);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with GetTransportOffset() to
    calculate the exact position of a transport at any given time. The transport period
    is set during transport creation and generally remains constant throughout the
    transport's lifetime.
