  signature: uint32 ManaSoulShardResource::GetAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current number of available mana soul shards for the player
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the count of mana soul shards that
    are currently available for use by the player. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, mana soul shards are a resource type used primarily by warlocks
    and other classes that can generate or consume these magical energy units. This
    method provides access to the current resource pool size without modifying it,
    making it useful for checking resource availability before performing actions
    that require shard consumption. The returned value represents the actual number
    of usable shards in the player's possession at the time of the call.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of available mana soul shards. This
    value will be zero if no shards are available or if the resource is not applicable
    to the current player class.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Shards Before Casting
    code: "uint32 shards = player->GetManaSoulShardResource()->GetAvailable();\nif\
      \ (shards >= 1)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell that consumes one shard\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_CONSUME_SHARD, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Display Resource Status to Player
    code: 'uint32 available = player->GetManaSoulShardResource()->GetAvailable();

      player->SendNotification("Mana Soul Shards: %u", available);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resource management
    functions to ensure proper resource handling. The returned value may change between
    calls if the player's shard count is modified by game events, spells, or other
    actions. This function is thread-safe as it only reads from the current resource
    state.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns a snapshot of the current resource state
    at the time of call. If multiple operations are performed in sequence, the resource
    count may have changed between calls. Always validate resource availability before
    consuming resources to prevent invalid operations.
