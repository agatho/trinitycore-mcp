  class: MongooseBiteTracker
  method: GetStacks
  signature: uint32 MongooseBiteTracker::GetStacks() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of the Mongoose Bite debuff applied to
    the target.
  description: The GetStacks method returns the number of times the Mongoose Bite
    debuff has been applied to a target. This debuff is typically associated with
    the Hunter ability Mongoose Bite, which applies a stacking damage-over-time effect.
    The returned value represents how many times this debuff has been layered on the
    target, influencing the overall damage dealt by subsequent applications of the
    ability. This method is commonly used in combat calculations and damage tracking
    within the TrinityCore framework for accurate simulation of hunter abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current stack count of the Mongoose Bite
    debuff. Returns 0 if no stacks are present on the target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 stacks = tracker->GetStacks();\nif (stacks > 0)\n{\n    // Apply\
      \ additional damage based on stack count\n    uint32 totalDamage = baseDamage\
      \ * (1 + (stacks * 0.1f));\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Stack Count for Ability Application
    code: "if (tracker->GetStacks() < MAX_MONGOOSE_BITE_STACKS)\n{\n    // Apply Mongoose\
      \ Bite\n    target->AddAura(MONGOOSE_BITE_AURA_ID, caster);\n}\nelse\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle maximum stack reached case\n    SendChatMessage(\"Mongoose Bite\
      \ is already at maximum stacks!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the MongooseBiteTracker instance has been properly
    initialized with a valid target. The stack count returned may be affected by various
    game mechanics such as debuff refresh rates, duration extensions, or removal effects
    from other abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the tracker object is not null before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The stack count might change dynamically during combat,
    so caching results for extended periods may lead to stale data.
