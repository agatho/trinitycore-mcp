documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target reference type associated with this spell implicit target
    info.
  description: The GetReferenceType method returns the SpellTargetReferenceTypes enumeration
    value that defines how the spell's target is referenced within the game system.
    This is used internally by TrinityCore to determine whether a spell targets the
    caster, an enemy, a friendly unit, or another specific reference type. The returned
    value influences how the spell system resolves and validates targets during spell
    execution. This method does not perform any validation or modification of internal
    state; it simply retrieves the pre-configured reference type for the implicit
    target information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellTargetReferenceTypes enumeration value indicating the reference
    type used for targeting this spell. Possible values include TARGET_REF_SELF, TARGET_REF_CASTER,
    TARGET_REF_ENEMY, TARGET_REF_FRIENDLY, and others depending on the spell's configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellImplicitTargetInfo targetInfo;\n// Assume targetInfo has been properly\
      \ initialized with a reference type\nSpellTargetReferenceTypes refType = targetInfo.GetReferenceType();\n\
      if (refType == TARGET_REF_SELF)\n{\n    // Handle self-targeting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell processing to determine how targets
    should be resolved. It's important to note that the returned value is set during
    initialization of the SpellImplicitTargetInfo object and does not change during
    runtime.
