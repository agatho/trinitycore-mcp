  class: SocialManager
  method: GetIgnoreList
  signature: int SocialManager::GetIgnoreList() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of players currently ignored by the social manager.
  description: The GetIgnoreList method returns an integer representing the count
    of players that are being ignored within the social manager's context. This method
    is typically used to determine how many users have been added to the ignore list
    for a specific player character, which affects communication and interaction behavior
    in World of Warcraft. The returned value corresponds to the size of the internal
    ignore list maintained by the SocialManager class. This count does not include
    any temporary or system-generated ignores, only those explicitly added by the
    user through the game interface or API.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of players currently ignored by
    this social manager instance. Returns zero if no players are being ignored.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int ignoredCount = player->GetSocial()->GetIgnoreList();\nif (ignoredCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    printf(\"You are currently ignoring %d players.\\n\", ignoredCount);\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"You are not ignoring anyone.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not provide access to the actual list of ignored player
    names or GUIDs; it only returns a count. The implementation likely involves iterating
    through an internal data structure that stores ignore entries, which may have
    performance implications for players with very large ignore lists.
