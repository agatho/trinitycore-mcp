  class: Battlefield
  method: SetData64
  signature: void Battlefield::SetData64(int dataId, int value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a 64-bit data value associated with a specific data identifier for the
    battlefield.
  description: The SetData64 method is used to store or update a 64-bit integer value
    linked to a particular data identifier within the Battlefield system. This functionality
    allows the battlefield to maintain and manage various state information, such
    as player counts, objectives, or other dynamic values that may change during the
    course of a battle. The method is typically invoked by game logic to reflect changes
    in battlefield conditions or player actions. It's important to note that this
    method operates on a data ID which must be valid within the context of the specific
    battlefield implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: dataId
    description: An integer identifier that specifies which data field to set. This
      ID should correspond to predefined constants or indices used within the battlefield's
      data management system.
  - name: value
    description: The 64-bit integer value to be stored for the specified data identifier.
      This can represent any numeric state information relevant to the battlefield,
      such as scores, counts, or flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Player Count
    code: battlefield->SetData64(BATTLEFIELD_DATA_PLAYER_COUNT, playerCount);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Objective Status
    code: 'battlefield->SetData64(BATTLEFIELD_DATA_OBJECTIVE_STATUS, objectiveStatus);

      // Example where objectiveStatus might be a bitmask representing multiple objectives'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battlefield's data management system and should
    only be called with valid data IDs that are defined within the specific battlefield
    implementation. The underlying storage mechanism for these values may vary depending
    on how the battlefield class is implemented, but it typically involves a map or
    array structure to associate data IDs with their respective 64-bit values.
  warnings: Ensure that the dataId parameter corresponds to valid identifiers defined
    in the battlefield's data schema. Using an invalid or undefined data ID could
    lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption. Additionally, since this method
    modifies internal state, it should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments
    where synchronization might be required.
