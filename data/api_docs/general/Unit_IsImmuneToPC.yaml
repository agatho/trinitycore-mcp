  signature: bool Unit::IsImmuneToPC() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is immune to player-controlled attacks.
  description: This method checks if a unit is immune to attacks originating from
    player-controlled sources, such as player characters or their pets. It returns
    true when the unit has immunity against player-controlled attacks, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is commonly used in game mechanics to prevent certain creatures
    from being attacked by players, or to determine if a unit can be targeted by player-controlled
    spells. The method is typically used in conjunction with other immunity-related
    functions to implement complex game logic involving player versus player combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is immune to player-controlled attacks, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the unit cannot be attacked or targeted by player
    characters or their pets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsImmuneToPC())\n{\n    // Handle immunity logic\n    // Unit\
      \ cannot be attacked by players\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the broader immunity system in TrinityCore. The implementation
    relies on internal flags and state management within the unit object. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this is a simple boolean check, but it should be
    used carefully in loops where multiple checks occur.
  warnings: This method does not distinguish between different types of player-controlled
    attacks; it simply checks for immunity against any player-controlled source. Care
    should be taken when using this in conjunction with other immunity methods to
    avoid incorrect logic in complex combat scenarios.
