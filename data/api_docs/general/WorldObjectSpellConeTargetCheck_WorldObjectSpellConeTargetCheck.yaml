    condList, SpellTargetObjectTypes objectType)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spell cone target check for determining valid targets within
    a specified cone area.
  description: The WorldObjectSpellConeTargetCheck constructor initializes a target
    selection mechanism used in spell casting to identify eligible targets within
    a defined cone-shaped area. This class is typically employed by the TrinityCore
    server's spell system to validate and filter targets based on spatial positioning,
    angle, range, and other criteria relevant to cone-based spells such as fireballs
    or lightning bolts. The initialization process sets up internal parameters including
    source location, cone angle, line width, maximum range, caster reference, spell
    information, selection type, conditional list, and object type constraints for
    target evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: coneSrc
    description: Reference to an integer representing the index or identifier of the
      cone's source point in the spell's context.
  - name: coneAngle
    description: Float value specifying the angular extent (in degrees) of the cone
      from the caster's facing direction.
  - name: lineWidth
    description: Float value indicating the width of the cone's base, used to determine
      how far outward the cone extends.
  - name: range
    description: Float value defining the maximum distance from the caster within
      which targets can be considered valid.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to a WorldObject instance representing the entity casting
      the spell, used for positioning and targeting logic.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to a SpellInfo structure containing metadata about the spell
      being cast, including effects and targeting rules.
  - name: selectionType
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of target selection logic to
      apply (e.g., nearest, furthest, random).
  - name: condList
    description: Pointer to an array of integers representing conditional checks or
      filters that must be satisfied for a target to qualify.
  - name: objectType
    description: Enumeration value specifying the type of WorldObject that should
      be considered as valid targets (e.g., players, creatures, game objects).
  returns: null

    language: cpp
  notes: This class is part of the core spell targeting system and is usually instantiated
    internally by the spell casting logic rather than directly by external code. It
    relies heavily on the WorldObject's position and orientation to compute valid
    targets within the cone area.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting cone parameters such as angle or range may result
    in invalid target selections or no targets being found, potentially causing spells
    to fail silently or behave unexpectedly.
