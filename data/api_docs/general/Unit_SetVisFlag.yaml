documentation:
  brief: Sets the visibility flag for a unit, determining how the unit appears to
    other players in the game world.
  description: The SetVisFlag method allows developers to control the visibility state
    of a Unit object within the World of Warcraft environment. This method is used
    to manage how units appear to other players, particularly in terms of visibility
    flags such as stealth, invisibility, or visibility in general. It typically affects
    the unit's appearance and behavior in relation to other players' perception, and
    can be used to implement game mechanics like hiding or revealing units based on
    player state or game context. The method is part of the core Unit class functionality
    and is essential for managing unit visibility in TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      Unit::SetVisFlag(UnitVisFlags::VIS_FLAG_STEALTH);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other visibility-related
    methods such as SetDisplayId or SetInvisibility. It may require careful handling
    of visibility flags to ensure proper game behavior and player experience. Performance
    considerations are minimal, but thread safety should be ensured when modifying
    visibility flags in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect visibility states for
    units, potentially causing gameplay issues or visual inconsistencies. Care must
    be taken when setting visibility flags to ensure they align with game mechanics
    and player expectations.
