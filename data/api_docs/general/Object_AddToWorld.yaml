  brief: Adds the object to the world grid, making it visible to other players and
    entities in the game.
  description: The AddToWorld method is responsible for integrating an Object into
    the World's grid system, ensuring that the object becomes accessible to other
    players and entities within the game world. This method typically involves adding
    the object to the appropriate grid cells and updating the object's state to reflect
    its presence in the world. It is commonly used during object initialization or
    when objects are moved between different zones or grids. The method ensures that
    the object's visibility and interaction capabilities are properly established
    within the game environment.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      obj->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after an object has been properly initialized
    and before it is used in gameplay interactions. It is essential for ensuring that
    objects are correctly placed within the World's grid system to maintain proper
    visibility and interaction.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to objects not being visible or accessible
    to other players, potentially causing game mechanics issues or errors. Care must
    be taken to ensure that objects are added to the world only after they have been
    properly initialized.
