  class: ArenaAI
  method: SetArenaProfile
  signature: void ArenaAI::SetArenaProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const ArenaProfile &
    profile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the arena profile for a player with the specified GUID.
  description: The SetArenaProfile method assigns or updates an arena profile for
    a specific player identified by their GUID. This method is typically used in the
    context of World of Warcraft's arena system within TrinityCore, where player arena
    statistics and rankings are maintained. The profile data includes various metrics
    such as match history, rating, and performance indicators relevant to arena gameplay.
    This method likely updates internal data structures or database entries associated
    with the player's arena activity. It is expected that the player GUID corresponds
    to an existing player in the game world, and the provided profile must be valid
    for proper assignment.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose arena profile is
      being set. This should correspond to a valid player entity within the game world.
  - name: profile
    description: An ArenaProfile object containing the arena statistics and data to
      be associated with the specified player. The profile must contain valid and
      consistent data for arena-related metrics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ArenaProfile myProfile;

      myProfile.rating = 1500;

      myProfile.wins = 42;

      myProfile.losses = 18;

      arenaAI->SetArenaProfile(123456, myProfile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the AI system for managing player behavior
    in arena environments. It may trigger updates to the database or internal caches.
    The ArenaProfile object should be properly initialized before being passed to
    this method.
  warnings: Passing an invalid player GUID or an improperly structured ArenaProfile
    object may lead to undefined behavior or data corruption. Ensure that the profile
    data is consistent with expected arena metrics and formats.
