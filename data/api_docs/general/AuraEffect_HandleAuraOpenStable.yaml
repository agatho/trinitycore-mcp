  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleAuraOpenStable
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraOpenStable(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Handles the application or removal of the Open Stable aura effect, which
    grants access to a player's stable master.
  description: The HandleAuraOpenStable method is responsible for managing the behavior
    of the Open Stable aura effect in World of Warcraft. This aura typically allows
    players to interact with their stable master to manage their pets. When applied,
    it enables the stable interface; when removed, it disables access. The method
    operates based on the AuraApplication context and the mode parameter indicating
    whether the effect is being applied or removed. It is part of the TrinityCore's
    aura handling system and integrates with the game's pet management mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      the aura being applied or removed. This includes details about which unit the
      aura affects, the aura's properties, and its current state.
  - name: mode
    description: An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the mode of operation. Typically
      used to distinguish between application (1) and removal (0) of the aura effect,
      though specific values may vary based on implementation details.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura is being applied (true)
      or removed (false). This parameter works in conjunction with the mode to determine
      the exact behavior of the aura effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura application
    code: "void MyAuraHandler::HandleAuraOpenStable(const AuraApplication* aurApp,\
      \ uint8 mode, bool apply) const {\n    if (apply) {\n        // Grant access\
      \ to stable master\n        Player* player = aurApp->GetTarget()->ToPlayer();\n\
      \        if (player)\n            player->SendPetitionSignatures();\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Remove access to stable master\n        Player* player = aurApp->GetTarget()->ToPlayer();\n\
      \        if (player)\n            player->ClearStableSlots();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by TrinityCore's aura system
    during aura application or removal events. Developers should ensure that any custom
    logic implemented in this method properly handles both the apply and remove states
    to avoid inconsistent behavior. The method does not directly interact with client-side
    UI elements but rather manages the underlying game state required for stable access.
  warnings: Improper handling of the apply/remove flags can lead to incorrect stable
    access permissions, potentially causing gameplay issues or exploits. Ensure that
    all related game mechanics are properly synchronized when modifying this behavior.
