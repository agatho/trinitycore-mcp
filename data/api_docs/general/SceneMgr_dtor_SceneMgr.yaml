documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SceneMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The SceneMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    allocated memory and resources used by the SceneMgr singleton. This includes releasing
    any scene objects, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no memory leaks
    occur when the manager is destroyed. The destructor is automatically called when
    the SceneMgr instance goes out of scope or during server shutdown. It ensures
    that all active scenes are properly terminated and their associated resources
    are freed, maintaining the integrity of the game's scene management system.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction during server shutdown
    code: "void ShutdownServer()\n{\n    // SceneMgr destructor automatically called\
      \ here\n    // All scenes and resources are cleaned up\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The SceneMgr destructor should not be called manually as it is a singleton
    instance. The destruction happens automatically during server shutdown or when
    the singleton is explicitly destroyed by the application lifecycle management.
