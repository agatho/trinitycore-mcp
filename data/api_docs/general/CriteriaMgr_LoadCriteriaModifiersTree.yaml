  brief: Initializes and loads the criteria modifiers tree for achievement tracking
    in the game.
  description: The LoadCriteriaModifiersTree method is responsible for initializing
    and loading the hierarchical structure of criteria modifiers used in World of
    Warcraft achievements. This internal method processes and organizes data related
    to how criteria are modified or adjusted during achievement progression, typically
    involving conditions, requirements, and contextual changes that affect player
    progress. It ensures that all modifier relationships between different criteria
    are properly established before achievements can be evaluated. The method is usually
    invoked during server startup or when loading achievement data from the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CriteriaMgr* criteriaMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetCriteriaMgr();

      criteriaMgr->LoadCriteriaModifiersTree();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server during initialization
    and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required for data reloading
    or debugging purposes. It relies on database tables containing criteria modifier
    definitions.
  warnings: Invoking this method outside of normal server initialization may cause
    inconsistencies in achievement tracking. Ensure that no active player sessions
    are affected when manually calling this function.
