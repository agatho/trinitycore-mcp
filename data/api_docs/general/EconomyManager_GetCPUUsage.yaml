  class: EconomyManager
  method: GetCPUUsage
  signature: float EconomyManager::GetCPUUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current CPU usage percentage of the economy system.
  description: The GetCPUUsage method provides a floating-point representation of
    the current CPU load imposed by the EconomyManager subsystem. This value typically
    ranges from 0.0 to 100.0, where 0.0 indicates no CPU activity and 100.0 represents
    maximum utilization. The method is designed to help developers monitor system
    performance and identify potential bottlenecks within the economy-related processes
    such as item pricing calculations, currency exchanges, or market data updates.
    It may use internal timing mechanisms to compute usage over a recent sampling
    period.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the percentage of CPU usage by the EconomyManager.
    Values typically range from 0.0 (no usage) to 100.0 (full utilization).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float cpuUsage = economyManager.GetCPUUsage();

      printf("Economy system CPU usage: %.2f%%\n", cpuUsage);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring CPU Load for Performance Tuning
    code: "void MonitorEconomyPerformance() {\n    float usage = economyManager.GetCPUUsage();\n\
      \    if (usage > 80.0f) {\n        sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"High Economy\
      \ CPU Usage Detected: %.2f%%\", usage);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using high-resolution timers or system-level
    performance counters to measure actual CPU time consumed by the economy subsystem.
    It may be called frequently in performance-critical sections, so developers should
    consider caching results if repeated calls are necessary.
  warnings: The returned value is an instantaneous measurement and may fluctuate rapidly.
    For accurate long-term analysis, multiple samples should be averaged over time
    intervals rather than relying on single readings.
