    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and targets an NPC for quest completion objectives.
  description: The FindNpcTarget method is responsible for identifying and selecting
    a suitable NPC target that meets the requirements of a given quest objective.
    This method typically operates within the context of AI-driven quest completion
    logic, where it searches for valid NPCs in the player's vicinity that can be interacted
    with to fulfill specific quest conditions. It evaluates various criteria such
    as NPC type, faction, availability, and proximity to determine if an NPC is appropriate
    for the current quest objective. The method returns true upon successfully finding
    a valid target, or false if no suitable NPC can be located within the specified
    constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player character
      that requires NPC targeting for quest completion.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the current quest objective, including required NPC types and interaction
      conditions.
  returns: Boolean value indicating success (true) if a valid NPC target was found
    and selected, or failure (false) if no suitable target could be identified within
    the search parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion AI
    code: "if (questCompletion.FindNpcTarget(playerBot, currentObjective)) {\n   \
      \ // Proceed with NPC interaction\n    playerBot->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Target acquired!\");\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no target found\n \
      \   playerBot->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"No valid target found.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with quest state management
    code: "bool targetFound = questCompletion.FindNpcTarget(player, questData.GetObjective(0));\n\
      if (targetFound) {\n    // Update quest state\n    player->GetQuestStatus(questId)\
      \ = QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE;\n    // Initiate interaction sequence\n    player->SetFacingToObject(target);\n\
      } else {\n    // Log failure and potentially trigger alternative behavior\n\
      \    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_AI, \"Failed to find NPC target for quest %u\"\
      , questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal AI systems and may perform database
    queries or world object searches. It's designed to be efficient in performance-critical
    scenarios such as automated quest completion bots. The method assumes that the
    player object has valid access to the game world context and that the objective
    data is properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that both the Player pointer and QuestObjectiveData reference are
    valid before calling this method, as invalid pointers may lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. This method might not be thread-safe if used outside of the main game
    thread context.
