  class: InterruptManager
  method: UpdateTargetInformation
  signature: void InterruptManager::UpdateTargetInformation(InterruptTarget & target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the interrupt target information with the latest data from the target.
  description: The UpdateTargetInformation method is responsible for refreshing and
    synchronizing the interrupt target's state and data within the InterruptManager.
    This method ensures that all relevant properties of the provided InterruptTarget
    object are up-to-date, including any changes in target status, position, or interrupt-related
    flags. It typically gets invoked during combat updates or when target conditions
    change to maintain accurate interrupt handling logic. The method operates on a
    single InterruptTarget reference and modifies its internal state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Reference to the InterruptTarget object whose information needs to
      be updated. This parameter represents the current target in the interrupt system
      and contains all relevant data about the target's state, including combat status,
      position, and interrupt-related properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptTarget myTarget;

      // ... initialize target ...

      interruptManager.UpdateTargetInformation(myTarget);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Combat Context
    code: "void UpdateCombatTarget(Unit* targetUnit)\n{\n    InterruptTarget& interruptTarget\
      \ = GetInterruptTarget(targetUnit);\n    interruptManager.UpdateTargetInformation(interruptTarget);\n\
      \    // ... continue with interrupt logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the interrupt system during
    combat updates. It's important to ensure that the target object passed to this
    method is valid and properly initialized before calling, as invalid targets may
    cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
