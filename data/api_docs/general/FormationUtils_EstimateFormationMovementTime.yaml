  class: FormationUtils
  method: EstimateFormationMovementTime
  signature: float FormationUtils::EstimateFormationMovementTime(const int & members,
    const int & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Estimates the time required for a formation of units to move to a specified
    destination.
  description: The EstimateFormationMovementTime method calculates an estimated movement
    duration for a group of units forming a specific formation when traveling to a
    given destination. This utility is typically used in AI pathfinding and unit movement
    logic within TrinityCore's game engine. The estimation takes into account the
    number of members in the formation and the distance to the destination, providing
    a float value representing time in seconds. The method assumes standard movement
    mechanics and does not account for dynamic obstacles or terrain variations during
    actual execution.
  parameters:
  - name: members
    description: The number of units participating in the formation. Must be a positive
      integer representing the count of entities in the group.
  - name: destination
    description: The distance to the target destination in yards. Should be a non-negative
      value indicating how far the formation needs to travel.
  returns: A float value representing the estimated time (in seconds) required for
    the formation to reach the destination. Returns zero if either parameter is invalid
    or negative.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float time = FormationUtils::EstimateFormationMovementTime(5, 100); // Estimates
      time for 5 units to travel 100 yards
    language: cpp
  - title: With Error Handling
    code: 'int memberCount = 3;

      int distance = -50; // Invalid negative distance

      float estimatedTime = FormationUtils::EstimateFormationMovementTime(memberCount,
      distance);

      // Returns 0.0f due to invalid input'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a simplified estimation and may not reflect real-time
    movement behavior affected by terrain, speed changes, or combat conditions. It
    is intended for use in pre-planning scenarios such as AI decision-making or path
    prediction rather than precise runtime calculations.
  warnings: The method does not validate input parameters beyond basic sign checks.
    Passing negative values for members or destination may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect estimations. Ensure that inputs are properly sanitized before calling
    this function.
