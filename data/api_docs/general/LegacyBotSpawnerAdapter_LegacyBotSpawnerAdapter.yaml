documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter class.
  description: The LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter constructor initializes the internal state
    and resources required for managing legacy bot spawning operations within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method sets up necessary data structures, registers
    event handlers, and prepares the adapter to interact with the game's bot management
    systems. The initialization process ensures that subsequent calls to spawn or
    manage bots will function correctly without requiring additional setup. This constructor
    is typically invoked during server startup or when a new bot spawner instance
    needs to be created.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter instance
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter* spawner = new LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter();

      // The spawner is now ready to be used for bot spawning operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor may perform resource allocation and initialization that
    could impact startup time. It's recommended to instantiate this adapter during
    server initialization rather than on-the-fly during gameplay to avoid performance
    penalties.
