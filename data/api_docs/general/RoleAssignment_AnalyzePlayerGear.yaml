  class: RoleAssignment
  method: AnalyzePlayerGear
  signature: void RoleAssignment::AnalyzePlayerGear(PlayerRoleProfile & profile, Player
    * player)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes a player's gear to determine their role based on equipment statistics
    and item properties.
  description: The AnalyzePlayerGear method evaluates the items currently equipped
    by a player, examining their stats, item levels, and other relevant properties
    to assign an appropriate role classification. This function is typically used
    in role-based group matching systems or for dynamically adjusting gameplay mechanics
    based on player capabilities. The method updates the provided PlayerRoleProfile
    object with calculated role metrics such as damage type (melee, ranged, spell),
    tanking potential, and overall gear contribution to team composition. It requires
    a valid player object and properly initialized profile structure to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: profile
    description: Reference to a PlayerRoleProfile object that will be updated with
      role analysis results. This structure holds computed role metrics derived from
      gear evaluation.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose equipment will be analyzed. Must
      be a valid player instance with equipped items for meaningful analysis.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Analysis Usage
    code: 'PlayerRoleProfile profile;

      Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Valid player pointer

      roleAssignment.AnalyzePlayerGear(profile, targetPlayer);

      // profile now contains role data based on targetPlayer''s gear'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Matching System
    code: "void UpdateGroupRoleAssignment(Player* player)\n{\n    PlayerRoleProfile\
      \ profile;\n    roleAssignment.AnalyzePlayerGear(profile, player);\n    \n \
      \   // Use profile to determine if player fits into a specific group role\n\
      \    switch (profile.GetPrimaryRole())\n    {\n        case ROLE_TANK:\n   \
      \         // Assign tank role logic\n            break;\n        case ROLE_DAMAGE:\n\
      \            // Assign damage dealer logic\n            break;\n        case\
      \ ROLE_HEALER:\n            // Assign healer role logic\n            break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a comprehensive evaluation of all equipped items including
    weapons, armor, and accessories. It may involve multiple database lookups or calculations
    depending on the complexity of gear analysis implemented in the system. The performance
    impact should be considered when calling this function frequently during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player object passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Passing an invalid player pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Also, make sure the PlayerRoleProfile is properly initialized
    before passing it to avoid memory corruption issues.
