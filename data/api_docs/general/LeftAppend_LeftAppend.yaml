  class: LeftAppend
  method: LeftAppend
  signature: void LeftAppend::LeftAppend(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a GUID value to the left side of the current object's data structure.
  description: The LeftAppend method is used to prepend or append a globally unique
    identifier (GUID) to the internal data structure of the LeftAppend class. This
    operation modifies the object's state by incorporating the provided GUID at the
    beginning of its data sequence. The method is typically utilized in systems where
    ordered identification or tracking of entities is required, such as in database
    operations or entity management within the TrinityCore framework. It is important
    to note that this method does not return any value and directly alters the instance's
    internal state.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: A constant reference to an integer representing the globally unique
      identifier (GUID) to be appended to the left side of the data structure. This
      value should correspond to a valid entity identifier within the game world,
      such as a player, creature, or game object GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of LeftAppend
    code: 'LeftAppend appendObj;

      int playerId = 12345;

      appendObj.LeftAppend(playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the LeftAppend object directly.
    It is recommended to ensure that the GUID parameter is valid and corresponds to
    an existing entity in the game world before calling this method.
