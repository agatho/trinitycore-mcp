  class: Map

  signature: const SpawnedPoolData & Map::GetPoolData() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spawned pool data for the current map instance
  description: This method retrieves the pool data associated with the current map
    instance, which contains information about spawned objects and their related spawn
    groups. The returned reference provides access to the pool data structure that
    tracks which objects have been spawned within this map's context. This is particularly
    useful for managing object spawning behavior and tracking spawn groups within
    the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a constant reference to the SpawnedPoolData structure, which contains
    information about spawned objects and their associated spawn groups. The reference
    ensures that the pool data remains accessible throughout the map's lifecycle without
    requiring additional memory allocation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Pool Data
    code: "const SpawnedPoolData& poolData = map->GetPoolData();\n// Use poolData\
      \ to access spawn group information\nif (poolData.empty()) {\n    // No objects\
      \ spawned in this map\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned reference should not be modified as it represents read-only data. Performance
    considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls to this method when the pool
    data is already known.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    map-related methods, as improper usage could lead to access violations or incorrect
    spawn group tracking. The reference returned may become invalid if the map instance
    is destroyed.
