documentation:
  brief: Returns the Unit object that cast the dynamic object
  description: The GetCaster method retrieves the Unit instance that originally cast
    the dynamic object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, dynamic objects
    are temporary game entities created by spells or abilities, such as area-of-effect
    effects, traps, or environmental spells. This method allows scripts and systems
    to access the caster unit for logic purposes, including checking the caster's
    properties, applying effects, or determining ownership. The returned Unit pointer
    is valid only while the caster unit remains in the world and has not been destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object that cast this dynamic object, or nullptr
    if the caster is no longer valid or available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check caster type
    code: "if (Unit* caster = dynObj->GetCaster()) {\n    if (caster->IsPlayer())\
      \ {\n        // Handle player caster logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using caster for damage calculation
    code: "Unit* caster = dynObj->GetCaster();\nif (caster && caster->IsAlive()) {\n\
      \    float damage = caster->GetTotalAttackPower() * 0.5f;\n    // Apply damage\
      \ to targets within range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Unit pointer should be checked for null before use, as the caster
    may have been destroyed or removed from the world. Dynamic objects are typically
    short-lived and their caster references are maintained only while the caster is
    valid.
  warnings: Do not store the returned Unit pointer beyond the scope where the dynamic
    object itself remains valid, as this could lead to dangling pointers. The caster
    may be deleted at any time, especially if it's a player or creature that has left
    the game.
