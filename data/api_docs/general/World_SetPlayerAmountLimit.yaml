api:
  class: World
  method: SetPlayerAmountLimit
  signature: void World::SetPlayerAmountLimit(uint32 limit)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of players allowed on the server.
  description: The SetPlayerAmountLimit method configures the global player limit
    for the World instance, determining how many players can simultaneously connect
    to the server. This setting affects the server's ability to accept new connections
    and is typically used during server maintenance or configuration changes. The
    method directly modifies an internal player count limit variable without requiring
    a restart. Changes take effect immediately for new connections but do not affect
    existing players.
  parameters:
  - name: limit
    description: The maximum number of players allowed to connect to the server simultaneously.
      Valid values are positive integers representing player capacity. Values of zero
      or very large numbers may cause unexpected behavior or connection issues.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Player Limit to 1000
    code: World::instance()->SetPlayerAmountLimit(1000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Server for Low Population
    code: 'World::instance()->SetPlayerAmountLimit(500);

      // Used during server testing or when expecting low player activity'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global setting that affects all realms managed by
    the World instance. The change is applied immediately to new connection attempts
    but existing players remain unaffected. Consider using this method in conjunction
    with server startup scripts or configuration loading routines.
  warnings: Setting the player limit too low may cause legitimate players to be unable
    to connect during peak hours. Setting it excessively high can lead to resource
    exhaustion and performance degradation. This method should not be called frequently
    during normal operation as it may impact connection handling performance.
