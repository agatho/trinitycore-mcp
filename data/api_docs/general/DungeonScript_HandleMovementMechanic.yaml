  class: DungeonScript
  method: HandleMovementMechanic
  signature: void DungeonScript::HandleMovementMechanic(int * player, int * boss)
documentation:
  brief: Handles movement mechanics for players and bosses within a dungeon scenario.
  description: The HandleMovementMechanic method is responsible for managing and executing
    specific movement behaviors for both player characters and boss entities during
    dungeon encounters. This method typically coordinates pathfinding, positioning
    adjustments, and animation triggers that are essential for maintaining proper
    combat flow and scripted events. It ensures that all participants in the dungeon
    scenario follow designated movement patterns, which may include teleportation,
    forced movement, or conditional pathing based on encounter state. The method operates
    within the context of a dungeon script system where precise control over NPC and
    player positioning is critical for successful raid or dungeon completion.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      within the dungeon encounter. This parameter typically references the player's
      current state or position in the encounter system.
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the boss's identifier or index
      within the dungeon encounter. This parameter typically references the boss's
      current state or position in the encounter system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    int playerID = 1;\n    int bossID = 5;\n\
      \    dungeonScript->HandleMovementMechanic(&playerID, &bossID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "void advancedExample() {\n    int playerID = getPlayer()->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    int bossID = getBoss()->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n    \n    if (isEncounterActive())\
      \ {\n        dungeonScript->HandleMovementMechanic(&playerID, &bossID);\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during scripted dungeon encounters and requires
    that both player and boss entities are properly initialized within the encounter
    context. The method may perform operations such as forced movement, teleportation,
    or animation triggering based on encounter state. Developers should ensure that
    all referenced entities are valid before calling this method to prevent undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player or boss parameters can lead to invalid
    memory access or incorrect positioning during encounters. Always validate entity
    references before invoking this method. This method may be called from different
    threads, so thread safety considerations should be taken into account when implementing
    custom logic.
