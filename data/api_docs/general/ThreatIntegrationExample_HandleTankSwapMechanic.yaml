documentation:
  brief: Manages the tank swap mechanic by updating threat coordination based on stack
    count
  description: The HandleTankSwapMechanic method is responsible for implementing the
    tank swap behavior in a threat-based encounter system. It takes a ThreatCoordinator
    object and a stack count parameter to determine how to adjust the current threat
    dynamics between units. This method typically handles scenarios where a tank swap
    occurs, such as when a new unit takes over aggro from the previous tank. The stack
    count parameter likely represents the number of times this mechanic has been triggered
    or the intensity level of the swap event. The method updates internal threat states
    and may trigger additional events or notifications to maintain proper combat flow.
  parameters:
  - name: coordinator
    description: Pointer to the ThreatCoordinator object that manages the current
      threat state and coordination between units in combat
  - name: stackCount
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer representing the number of times the tank
      swap mechanic has been applied or the intensity level of the current swap event
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank Swap Handling
    code: 'ThreatIntegrationExample example;

      ThreatCoordinator* coord = new ThreatCoordinator();

      example.HandleTankSwapMechanic(coord, 1);

      // Triggers basic tank swap with one stack'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Tank Swap with Multiple Stacks
    code: 'ThreatIntegrationExample example;

      ThreatCoordinator* coord = sObjectAccessor->GetThreatCoordinator();

      example.HandleTankSwapMechanic(coord, 5);

      // Triggers tank swap with five stacks for enhanced threat adjustment'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat scenarios where threat
    coordination is required. The ThreatCoordinator must be properly initialized before
    calling this method. Consider thread safety implications when using this method
    in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid ThreatCoordinator pointer will result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the stackCount parameter is within
    reasonable bounds to avoid unexpected threat adjustments.
