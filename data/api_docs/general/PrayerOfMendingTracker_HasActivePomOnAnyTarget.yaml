documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has any active Prayer of Mending effects on targets.
  description: This method determines whether the player currently has any active
    Prayer of Mending (POM) effects applied to one or more targets. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore implementation, POM is a healing spell that can be cast on multiple
    targets and provides periodic healing over time. The method evaluates the internal
    tracking state of the PrayerOfMendingTracker class to identify if any such active
    effects exist. This check is typically used for cooldown management, spell interaction
    logic, or preventing duplicate applications of the same effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are one or more active Prayer of Mending effects
    on any target; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (player->GetPrayerOfMendingTracker()->HasActivePomOnAnyTarget()) {\n\
      \    // Prevent casting another POM if one is already active\n    SendSpellFailed(SPELL_FAILED_SPELL_IN_PROGRESS);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Before Applying New Effect
    code: "PrayerOfMendingTracker* pomTracker = player->GetPrayerOfMendingTracker();\n\
      if (!pomTracker->HasActivePomOnAnyTarget()) {\n    // Apply new POM effect\n\
      \    DoPomEffect(target);\n} else {\n    // Handle case where POM is already\
      \ active\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You already have a Prayer of Mending active.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the PrayerOfMendingTracker
    class. It does not directly query the game world for active spell effects but
    instead uses cached or tracked information about POM applications. The implementation
    may be optimized to return early if no targets are tracked, improving performance
    in scenarios with many players.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a substitute for checking actual spell
    effect durations or target validity. It only reflects the internal tracking state
    and might not account for edge cases such as delayed removals or server-side cleanup
    of effects.
