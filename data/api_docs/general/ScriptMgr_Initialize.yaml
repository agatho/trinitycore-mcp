  class: ScriptMgr
  method: Initialize
  signature: void ScriptMgr::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the script management system for TrinityCore.
  description: The Initialize method sets up and prepares the ScriptMgr class for
    handling game scripts. It typically loads script configurations, initializes internal
    data structures, and prepares the scripting environment to handle events and callbacks
    during server operation. This method is usually called during the server startup
    process before any gameplay begins. The initialization ensures that all registered
    scripts are properly loaded and ready to be invoked by the game engine when appropriate
    events occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: ScriptMgr::Initialize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup. It is typically
    invoked by the core server initialization logic and should not be called manually
    in most cases. The method may perform time-consuming operations such as loading
    script files or initializing databases, so it's recommended to call it early in
    the boot sequence.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times can lead to undefined behavior or memory
    leaks. It must be invoked before any scripts are expected to run. Do not call
    this method from within a game event handler or during active gameplay as it may
    disrupt the script execution environment.
