  class: BattlegroundQueue
  method: AddGroup
  signature: GroupQueueInfo * BattlegroundQueue::AddGroup(const Player * leader, const

    uint32 ArenaRating, uint32 MatchmakerRating)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a group to the battleground queue with specified parameters.
  description: The AddGroup method is responsible for inserting a player group into
    the battleground queue system. It takes a leader player, the group itself, team
    affiliation, bracket information, and premade status to create a GroupQueueInfo
    object that represents the queued group. This method is typically called when
    players attempt to join a battleground queue as a group rather than individually.
    The method handles the necessary bookkeeping for group-based matchmaking and ensures
    proper queue management according to game rules.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the player who leads the group attempting to queue. Must
      be a valid Player object.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that is being queued. Must be a valid
      Group with members.
  - name: team
    description: Team identifier (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) indicating which faction
      the group belongs to.
  - name: bracketEntry
    description: Pointer to PVPDifficultyEntry that defines the bracket (level range
      and battleground type) for this queue entry.
  - name: isPremade
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the group is premade (already formed
      before queueing).
  - name: ArenaRating
    description: The arena rating of the group, used for ranked battleground matchmaking.
      Zero if not applicable.
  - name: MatchmakerRating
    description: The matchmaker rating used for ranked battleground matching. Zero
      if not applicable.
  returns: Returns a pointer to GroupQueueInfo which contains information about the
    queued group, including queue position and status. Returns NULL if the group could
    not be added due to invalid parameters or system errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AddGroup
    code: "GroupQueueInfo* gqi = bgQueue->AddGroup(player, group, TEAM_ALLIANCE, bracket,\
      \ false, 0, 0);\nif (gqi != nullptr) {\n    // Group successfully added to queue\n\
      \    sWorld->SendGlobalText(\"Group queued for battleground.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to add group\n    sWorld->SendGlobalText(\"Failed to queue group.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding a premade group with arena rating
    code: "GroupQueueInfo* gqi = bgQueue->AddGroup(leaderPlayer, playerGroup, TEAM_HORDE,\
      \ bracketEntry, true, 1500, 1200);\nif (gqi != nullptr) {\n    // Group queued\
      \ as premade with specific ratings\n    sWorld->SendGlobalText(\"Premade group\
      \ queued with arena rating: 1500\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground queue system and interacts with internal
    data structures to manage player groups. It performs validation on input parameters
    and may modify the internal state of the BattlegroundQueue class. The returned
    GroupQueueInfo pointer should be used carefully as it's managed internally by
    the queue system.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null pointers (leader, group, bracketEntry)
    will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all parameters are
    valid before calling AddGroup. Also, be aware that groups added to the queue may
    not immediately begin matchmaking if there are no matching opponents available.
