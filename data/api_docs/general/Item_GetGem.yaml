documentation:
  brief: Returns the gem identifier stored in the specified slot of an item.
  description: The GetGem method retrieves the gem identifier (ID) stored in a specific
    gem slot of an Item object. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to access gem information embedded within items, particularly
    for items that have gems socketed in them. The method returns a pointer to an
    integer representing the gem ID, or nullptr if no gem is present in the specified
    slot. It is typically used during item processing and gem validation operations,
    especially when examining item properties or performing gem-related calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const int pointer representing the gem ID stored in the specified
    slot. If no gem is present in the slot, it returns nullptr. The returned value
    can be used for further processing such as checking if a gem exists, verifying
    gem properties, or performing gem-related operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = new Item();\nconst int* gemId = item->GetGem(0);\nif (gemId\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Gem exists, process gem ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Item class and relies on internal slot management
    for gem storage. It should be used carefully when dealing with item data to avoid
    accessing invalid memory or null pointers. Performance considerations include
    checking if a gem exists before accessing it.
  warnings: Using this method without proper validation may lead to accessing invalid
    memory or nullptr dereferences. Ensure that the slot being accessed is valid and
    that the item actually contains gems in that slot.
