  class: RoleAssignment
  method: ValidateRoleAssignment
  signature: bool RoleAssignment::ValidateRoleAssignment(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a role assignment within a group is properly configured
    and meets all required criteria.
  description: The ValidateRoleAssignment method checks if the current role assignment
    for a given group adheres to predefined rules and constraints. This includes verifying
    that all necessary roles are assigned, no duplicate roles exist for the same player,
    and that the group's overall composition satisfies the game's role-based requirements.
    The method ensures that the group is balanced in terms of role distribution (e.g.,
    tank, healer, damage dealer) and that each member has a valid role assigned. It
    typically returns true if all validation checks pass, or false otherwise. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining proper group dynamics in raid encounters
    where specific roles are mandatory for success.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the role assignment within the group passes all validation
    checks; otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that one or
    more role assignments are invalid, missing, or improperly configured.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Assignment Validation
    code: "Group* group = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (group)\n{\n    RoleAssignment\
      \ roleAssign;\n    bool isValid = roleAssign.ValidateRoleAssignment(group);\n\
      \    if (!isValid)\n    {\n        // Handle invalid role assignment\n     \
      \   sLog->outError(\"Invalid role assignment in group %u\", groupId);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks on the Group's member list and their assigned
    roles. It may be called during group creation, role changes, or before allowing
    players to enter certain raid instances. The implementation might involve iterating
    through all group members and validating their role assignments against internal
    game rules.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the group pointer is valid can
    lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Always verify that the Group object exists
    and is properly initialized before invoking this method.
