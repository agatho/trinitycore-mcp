api:
  class: SummonList
  method: DoActionImpl
  signature: void SummonList::DoActionImpl(int action, StorageType & summons, int
    max)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a specified action on all summons within the SummonList storage.
  description: The DoActionImpl method performs a given action on each summon stored
    in the SummonList's internal storage. It iterates through the collection of summoned
    creatures or objects, applying the specified behavior or command to each one.
    This method is typically used in AI scripts and creature behaviors where a group
    of summons needs to be controlled or acted upon collectively. The maximum number
    of summons to process can be limited by the max parameter, ensuring that only
    a subset of summons are affected if necessary. This functionality supports complex
    summoning mechanics such as commanding multiple pets or guardians simultaneously.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: An integer identifier representing the action to be performed on
      each summon. Valid values depend on the specific implementation and context,
      typically corresponding to predefined action codes used in the TrinityCore AI
      system.
  - name: summons
    description: A reference to a StorageType container holding the collection of
      summons that will have the action applied to them. This is usually a list or
      array of pointers to Creature or GameObject objects.
  - name: max
    description: An integer specifying the maximum number of summons from the storage
      that should be processed. If set to -1, all summons in the storage will be processed;
      otherwise, only up to 'max' summons will be acted upon.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DoActionImpl to command all summons
    code: 'SummonList summonList;

      // Assume summonList is populated with creatures

      summonList.DoActionImpl(1, summonList.GetStorage(), -1); // Command all summons
      with action ID 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Limiting the number of summons affected by DoActionImpl
    code: 'SummonList summonList;

      // Assume summonList is populated with creatures

      summonList.DoActionImpl(2, summonList.GetStorage(), 3); // Command only first
      3 summons with action ID 2'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the StorageType container passed in contains valid
    pointers to summon objects. It does not perform any safety checks for null or
    invalid entries, so callers must ensure data integrity before invoking this method.
    The action parameter should map to a known behavior defined within the AI system
    of TrinityCore.
  warnings: Passing an invalid action ID may result in undefined behavior or no effect
    on summons. Ensure that the StorageType reference is properly initialized and
    contains valid summon objects before calling this method. Be cautious when using
    negative values for 'max' as it might lead to unexpected iteration behavior if
    not handled correctly.
