documentation:
  brief: Moves a LFGBotManager instance to another LFGBotManager instance, transferring
    all managed resources and state.
  description: The LFGBotManager move constructor is responsible for transferring
    ownership of resources from a source LFGBotManager object to a newly created destination
    LFGBotManager object. This operation is typically used in scenarios where an LFGBotManager
    object needs to be efficiently moved rather than copied, such as when returning
    objects from functions or assigning them to other variables. The move constructor
    ensures that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state, while
    the destination object takes full ownership of all internal resources. This mechanism
    is essential for performance optimization in C++ applications where avoiding expensive
    deep copies is critical.

  examples:
  - title: Moving LFGBotManager instance to new variable
    code: 'LFGBotManager sourceManager;

      // ... initialize sourceManager ...

      LFGBotManager newManager = std::move(sourceManager); // Move constructor invoked

      // sourceManager is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Returning LFGBotManager from function using move semantics
    code: "LFGBotManager createBotManager() {\n    LFGBotManager manager;\n    //\
      \ ... initialize manager ...\n    return manager; // Move constructor used for\
      \ return value optimization\n}\n\n// Usage:\nLFGBotManager botManager = createBotManager();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor is part of the C++ standard library's move semantics
    implementation. It should only be called when explicitly moving an object, not
    during normal copy operations. The source object after a move operation must not
    be used in any way that requires its state to be valid.
  warnings: Do not use the moved-from object after calling this constructor as it
    leaves the source object in an unspecified but valid state. Using the source object
    afterward may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
