  signature: AIDecisionTimer & AIDecisionTimer::operator=(AIDecisionTimer && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of a source AIDecisionTimer to this AIDecisionTimer, leaving
    the source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The move assignment operator for AIDecisionTimer transfers all resources
    and state from the source AIDecisionTimer object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used to efficiently transfer ownership of dynamically allocated memory
    or other resources without performing deep copies. After the move, the source
    object will be left in a valid but unspecified state, meaning it can still be
    safely destroyed or assigned to, but its contents are not guaranteed to be in
    any particular condition. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this
    method would commonly be used when managing AI decision timers within creature
    behavior systems where efficient resource management is crucial for performance.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another AIDecisionTimer object whose contents
      will be moved to this object. This parameter must not be null or in an invalid
      state.
  returns: A reference to the current AIDecisionTimer object (this), allowing for
    chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'AIDecisionTimer timer1;

      AIDecisionTimer timer2 = std::move(timer1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      timer1 = std::move(timer2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Timer Usage in Creature Behavior
    code: "class AIController {\npublic:\n    void UpdateDecisionTimer() {\n     \
      \   AIDecisionTimer newTimer;\n        // ... populate newTimer with decision\
      \ data ...\n        m_decisionTimer = std::move(newTimer); // Efficiently transfer\
      \ timer\n    }\nprivate:\n    AIDecisionTimer m_decisionTimer;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics standard and should be implemented
    as a noexcept operation when possible to ensure exception safety. The source object
    after a move assignment should not be used in any way that would access its previous
    contents, though it can still be safely destroyed or assigned to again.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after performing a move assignment. The behavior
    of accessing or using the moved-from object is undefined until it is reassigned
    or explicitly reset. This is especially important in AI systems where timer states
    might affect creature behavior decisions.
