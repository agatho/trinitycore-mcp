  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotAccountMgr::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot account management system
  description: The Initialize method sets up and prepares the BotAccountMgr for managing
    bot accounts within the TrinityCore environment. It performs necessary setup operations
    such as loading configuration data, initializing internal data structures, and
    establishing connections or resources required for bot account handling. This
    method should be called once during server startup to ensure proper initialization
    of the bot account management functionality. The method returns true if initialization
    is successful, or false if any critical errors occur during setup.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot account manager was successfully initialized, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates a failure in loading configuration
    data, establishing required resources, or initializing internal components.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotAccountMgr* botMgr = new BotAccountMgr();\nbool success = botMgr->Initialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Bot account manager is ready for use\n    printf(\"\
      Bot account manager initialized successfully\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ initialization failure\n    printf(\"Failed to initialize bot account manager\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup. Reinitialization
    attempts may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method performs
    blocking operations during initialization, so calling it from a critical thread
    path might impact performance.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    memory leaks or inconsistent state. Ensure that all bot accounts are properly
    shut down before attempting reinitialization.
