  class: ScriptMgr
  method: OnReset
  signature: void ScriptMgr::OnReset(Vehicle * veh)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a vehicle is reset, allowing scripts to perform cleanup or reinitialization
    tasks.
  description: The OnReset method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework whenever
    a vehicle object undergoes a reset operation. This typically occurs during vehicle
    destruction, respawn, or when transitioning between different states in the game
    world. The method provides an opportunity for custom scripts to execute cleanup
    routines, reset vehicle-specific data, or reinitialize components before the vehicle
    becomes active again. It is part of the scriptable event system that allows developers
    to extend or modify default vehicle behavior without directly modifying core game
    logic.
  parameters:
  - name: veh
    description: Pointer to the Vehicle object being reset. This parameter represents
      the specific vehicle instance that triggered the reset event and contains all
      relevant data about the vehicle's current state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Reset Handler
    code: "class MyVehicleScript : public VehicleScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyVehicleScript()\
      \ : VehicleScript(\"MyVehicleScript\") {}\n\n    void OnReset(Vehicle* veh)\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Clear any custom vehicle data\n        if (veh)\n\
      \        {\n            veh->SetUInt32Value(VEHICLE_DATA_CUSTOM_FLAG, 0);\n\
      \            // Perform additional reset logic here\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core vehicle update loop
    or during state transitions. Developers should ensure that any operations performed
    in this method are lightweight to avoid performance degradation. The Vehicle pointer
    passed to this function may be null in certain edge cases, so null checks are
    recommended.
  warnings: Do not perform heavy computations or database operations within this method
    as it can block the game loop. Avoid modifying vehicle properties that might cause
    recursive calls or infinite loops during reset operations.
