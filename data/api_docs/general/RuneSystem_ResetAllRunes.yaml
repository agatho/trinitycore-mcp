documentation:
  brief: Resets all runes for the player, making them available for use again.
  description: The ResetAllRunes method clears the cooldown state of all runes associated
    with the player's character. This function is typically invoked when a player
    enters certain zones, respawns after death, or when specific game events occur
    that require rune regeneration. It ensures that all rune types (Blood, Frost,
    Unholy, and Death) are immediately available for use without any remaining cooldown
    time. The method operates on the player's current rune system state and does not
    affect other character attributes or abilities outside of the rune mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Update
    code: "void Player::OnEnterWorld()\n{\n    // Reset all runes when player enters\
      \ world\n    _runeSystem.ResetAllRunes();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Runes on Respawn
    code: "void Player::Respawn()\n{\n    // Ensure runes are reset upon respawn\n\
      \    _runeSystem.ResetAllRunes();\n    // Additional respawn logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the internal rune cooldown timers and should
    only be called when appropriate game state transitions occur. It is recommended
    to verify that this method is not invoked during combat or other critical gameplay
    moments to prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling ResetAllRunes outside of proper game state transitions may lead
    to inconsistent rune behavior or exploit opportunities. Ensure all calls are made
    in appropriate contexts such as zone entry, respawning, or specific event triggers.
