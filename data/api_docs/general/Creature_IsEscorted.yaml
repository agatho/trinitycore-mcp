  method: IsEscorted
  signature: bool Creature::IsEscorted() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is currently on an escort quest.
  description: The IsEscorted method checks if a creature is actively participating
    in an escort quest, which typically involves following a player or another NPC
    to a specific destination. This method is commonly used in quest-related AI behavior
    where creatures need to maintain their escort state during gameplay. The function
    returns true when the creature is currently on an escort, and false otherwise.
    It's particularly useful for determining if a creature should continue following
    its escort target or if it has reached its destination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is currently on an escort quest, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the creature is actively following a player or NPC as part
    of an escort mission.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsEscorted()) {\n    // Creature is currently escorting someone\n\
      \    // Perform escort-related actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest state tracking and may not reflect the
    actual behavior if the creature's escort status changes during runtime. The method
    should be used in conjunction with other quest-related functions to properly manage
    creature escort behavior.
  warnings: This method only returns accurate results when the creature is actively
    involved in an escort quest. If the creature was previously on an escort but has
    since completed it, this method will return false even though the creature may
    have been following a player previously.
