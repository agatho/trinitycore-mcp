  class: DB2Manager
  method: IsSpecSetMember
  signature: bool DB2Manager::IsSpecSetMember(int32 specSetId, uint32 specId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specialization ID belongs to a specific specialization set.
  description: The IsSpecSetMember method determines whether a given specialization
    ID is part of a specified specialization set. This functionality is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's class and specialization systems to validate or filter
    specializations based on predefined sets. The method performs a lookup within
    the DB2 database structures that store specialization data, ensuring accurate
    classification of player class specializations. It returns true if the specId
    is found within the specSetId collection, otherwise false.
  parameters:
  - name: specSetId
    description: The identifier of the specialization set to check against. This value
      corresponds to a unique set definition in the DB2 files.
  - name: specId
    description: The identifier of the specialization to verify. This represents a
      specific class specialization within the game's data structure.
  returns: Returns true if the specId is a member of the specSetId, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sDB2Manager->IsSpecSetMember(100, 5)) {\n    // Handle case where specialization\
      \ ID 5 belongs to set 100\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Class Logic
    code: "bool isValidSpec = sDB2Manager->IsSpecSetMember(playerClassSpecSetId, playerSpecId);\n\
      if (!isValidSpec) {\n    // Log invalid specialization or prevent action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures and assumes that the specSetId
    and specId parameters are valid identifiers present in the loaded DB2 files. The
    implementation likely uses hash tables or similar fast lookup mechanisms for performance.
  warnings: Ensure that both specSetId and specId values are within expected ranges
    to avoid unexpected behavior. Invalid IDs may lead to incorrect return values
    or potential crashes if not properly validated.
