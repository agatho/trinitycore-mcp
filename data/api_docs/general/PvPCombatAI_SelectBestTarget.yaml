  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: SelectBestTarget
  signature: int * PvPCombatAI::SelectBestTarget(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the most suitable target for PvP combat based on AI logic.
  description: The SelectBestTarget method evaluates available player targets within
    the AI's awareness range and selects the optimal one for engagement. It considers
    factors such as threat level, distance, health status, and player priority to
    determine the best target. This method is typically used by PvP-enabled creatures
    or NPCs that engage in player-versus-player combat scenarios. The returned pointer
    points to a GUID value representing the selected target player.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the selected target player,
    or nullptr if no suitable target is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in PvP combat AI
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = ...;\nint* target_guid = ai->SelectBestTarget();\nif\
      \ (target_guid != nullptr)\n{\n    // Engage the selected target\n    Unit*\
      \ target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, *target_guid);\n    if (target && target->IsInWorld())\n\
      \    {\n        me->Attack(target, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvP combat AI system and relies on internal threat
    tables and target selection logic. It should only be called when the AI has active
    players within its detection range to avoid unnecessary processing.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no valid targets are available, so
    always check for nullptr before dereferencing. Additionally, this method assumes
    that all players in range have been properly evaluated for threat and priority.
