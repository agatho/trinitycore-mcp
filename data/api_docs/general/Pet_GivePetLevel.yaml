  class: Pet
  method: GivePetLevel
  signature: void Pet::GivePetLevel(uint8 level)
documentation:
  brief: Increases the pet's level to the specified value, updating its stats and
    abilities accordingly.
  description: The GivePetLevel method sets the pet's level to the provided value,
    triggering updates to the pet's statistics such as health, mana, damage, and spell
    capabilities. This method is typically used when a player's pet needs to be leveled
    up manually or during quest progression. The method ensures that all relevant
    pet attributes are adjusted to match the new level, including stat points allocation
    and skill updates. It is important to note that this method does not validate
    whether the provided level is within acceptable bounds for the pet type, so calling
    it with an invalid level may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The target level to set for the pet. Must be a valid positive integer
      representing the desired pet level. Typically ranges from 1 to the maximum allowed
      level for the specific pet type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Level a pet to 10
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->GivePetLevel(10);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamically level up a pet based on player's level
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nPet* pet = player->GetPet();\nif (pet && player->GetLevel()\
      \ > pet->getLevel())\n{\n    pet->GivePetLevel(player->GetLevel());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles stat recalculations and may trigger visual
    updates or combat state changes. It is recommended to call this method only when
    necessary, as frequent calls could impact performance. The method assumes that
    the pet is currently active and valid within the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method with a level higher than what is supported by the
    pet type can lead to undefined behavior or client-side issues. Always validate
    input values before calling this method. Additionally, this method does not account
    for any level restrictions imposed by the game's rules (e.g., maximum pet level
    based on player's level).
