  class: LootAnalysis
  method: IsItemContestedInGroup
  signature: bool LootAnalysis::IsItemContestedInGroup(Group * group, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific loot item is currently contested within a group's
    loot distribution process.
  description: The IsItemContestedInGroup method checks if a given loot item is in
    a contested state within the context of a specified group. In World of Warcraft's
    loot system, an item becomes contested when multiple players have rolled on it
    and the result is not immediately decided, typically due to a roll or need-based
    distribution mechanism. This function evaluates whether such a contested status
    exists for the provided item in the given group's current loot context. The method
    is primarily used internally by the loot system to manage contested items and
    ensure proper distribution according to group loot rules.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose loot contest
      status is being checked. Must not be null.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the specific item being evaluated for contested status. The item must have been
      previously added to the group's loot system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified item is currently contested within the group's
    loot distribution, meaning multiple players have rolled on it and a resolution
    has not yet been determined. Returns false if the item is not contested or if
    the group does not contain this item in its current loot context.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is contested in a group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nLootItem item;\n// Assume item is initialized\
      \ with valid data\nif (LootAnalysis::IsItemContestedInGroup(group, item)) {\n\
      \    // Handle contested item logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Item is contested\
      \ in the group.\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"Item is not contested.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal loot tracking mechanisms within TrinityCore's
    group loot system. It should only be called when the group has an active loot
    distribution process, otherwise it may return unexpected results. The method does
    not perform any locking or thread safety checks internally, so callers should
    ensure proper synchronization if accessing from multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that both the Group pointer and LootItem reference are valid before
    calling this method. Passing null pointers or uninitialized items can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. This function is part of the internal loot system
    and may not be suitable for general use outside of core loot handling code.
