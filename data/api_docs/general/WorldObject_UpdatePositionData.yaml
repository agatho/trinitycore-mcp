  class: WorldObject
  method: UpdatePositionData
  signature: void WorldObject::UpdatePositionData()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the position data of the WorldObject, including coordinates, orientation,
    and map information.
  description: The UpdatePositionData method synchronizes the internal position state
    of a WorldObject with its current location in the game world. This includes updating
    X, Y, Z coordinates, orientation (rotation), and map reference data. The method
    is typically invoked when an object's position changes due to movement, teleportation,
    or respawn events. It ensures that all subsystems relying on accurate position
    information have access to up-to-date data for collision detection, visibility
    calculations, and spatial queries. This method may also trigger related updates
    such as zone change notifications or grid cell repositioning.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = ...;

      obj->UpdatePositionData();

      // Position data is now synchronized with current location'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Movement
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->MovePosition(new_x, new_y, new_z);

      player->UpdatePositionData();

      // Ensures position is updated after movement operation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a WorldObject's physical location changes
    to maintain consistency across the game world. It may internally trigger grid
    repositioning logic and update spatial partitioning data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently without proper conditions can cause performance
    issues due to internal recalculations of spatial relationships. Avoid calling
    it in tight loops or during high-frequency updates.
