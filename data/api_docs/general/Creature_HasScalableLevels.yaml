documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature has scalable levels.
  description: This method checks if a creature object possesses scalable levels,
    which allows it to have its level adjusted based on player context or game mechanics.
    It is commonly used in scenarios where creatures need to adapt their difficulty
    or experience points based on the player's level or other factors. The method
    returns true when the creature supports scalable levels and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature has scalable levels, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the creature can adjust its level dynamically based on game
    context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->HasScalableLevels()) {\n    // Creature can scale its level\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature-level related
    functions to determine how a creature should behave in different player scenarios.
    It may impact performance if used frequently in loops.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency contexts as it may
    affect performance if not properly optimized. Also, ensure that the creature actually
    supports scalable levels before calling this method.
