  method: GetOptimalMeleeRange
  signature: float PositionStrategyBase::GetOptimalMeleeRange()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal melee range for a unit based on its current
    position and target.
  description: The GetOptimalMeleeRange method determines the ideal distance a unit
    should maintain from its target during melee combat. This calculation takes into
    account various factors such as the unit's attack range, the target's size, and
    positioning strategies. The returned value represents the distance in yards at
    which the unit should engage in melee combat for maximum effectiveness. This method
    is typically used by AI systems to make decisions about movement and engagement
    during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal melee range in yards. This value
    indicates the recommended distance from the target where a unit should position
    itself for effective melee attacks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "float optimalRange = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetOptimalMeleeRange();\n\
      if (unit->GetDistance(unit->GetVictim()) > optimalRange)\n{\n    unit->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(unit->GetVictim(),\
      \ optimalRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the positioning strategy system and may be overridden
    by specific AI implementations. The calculation considers both the attacker's
    and target's hitbox dimensions to determine optimal positioning.
