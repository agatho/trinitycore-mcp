    & avgTime, uint32 & maxTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves pathfinding statistics including total paths computed, average
    computation time, and maximum computation time.
  description: 'The GetPathStatistics method provides performance metrics for the
    pathfinding system within the TrinityCore framework. It retrieves three key statistics:
    the total number of paths computed, the average time taken to compute a single
    path in milliseconds, and the maximum time taken for any individual path computation.
    These statistics are useful for monitoring and optimizing AI behavior and navigation
    performance in World of Warcraft environments. The method is typically used for
    debugging, performance analysis, or integration with monitoring systems that track
    pathfinding efficiency. This function does not modify any internal state and can
    be called safely from any thread context.'

    code: 'uint32 totalPaths, avgTime, maxTime;

      pathfinder->GetPathStatistics(totalPaths, avgTime, maxTime);

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Pathfinding Stats - Total: %u, Avg Time: %u ms, Max Time:
      %u ms", totalPaths, avgTime, maxTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method aggregates statistics from all pathfinding operations performed
    since the last reset or initialization. The values are updated incrementally as
    paths are computed and may not reflect real-time performance during high-load
    conditions. For accurate performance monitoring, consider calling this method
    periodically or after significant AI activity.
