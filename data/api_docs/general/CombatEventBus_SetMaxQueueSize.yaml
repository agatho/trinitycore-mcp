  class: CombatEventBus
  method: SetMaxQueueSize
  signature: void CombatEventBus::SetMaxQueueSize(uint32 size)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum queue size for combat events in the CombatEventBus.
  description: The SetMaxQueueSize method configures the maximum number of combat
    events that can be queued within the CombatEventBus. This limit helps manage memory
    usage and ensures the system does not become overwhelmed with too many pending
    combat-related events. When the queue reaches its maximum capacity, new events
    may be dropped or handled according to the internal queue management strategy.
    This method is typically used during initialization or configuration of combat
    systems to balance performance and event handling capacity.
  parameters:
  - name: size
    description: The maximum number of combat events that can be queued. Must be a
      positive integer value. Larger values allow more events to be buffered but consume
      more memory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Queue Size
    code: 'CombatEventBus& bus = CombatEventBus::Instance();

      bus.SetMaxQueueSize(1000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Combat Event Queue for High-Performance Scenario
    code: "void InitializeCombatSystem()\n{\n    CombatEventBus& bus = CombatEventBus::Instance();\n\
      \    // Set a large queue size for high-combat activity zones\n    bus.SetMaxQueueSize(5000);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal queue capacity of the CombatEventBus.
    It should be called before significant combat activity begins to avoid unexpected
    behavior. The actual implementation may involve thread synchronization to ensure
    safe updates to the queue size.
  warnings: Setting an excessively large queue size can lead to high memory consumption,
    especially during peak combat activity. Conversely, setting it too low may cause
    event loss during high-intensity combat scenarios.
