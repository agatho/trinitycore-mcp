  class: BotWorldEntryQueue
  method: ProcessQueue
  signature: void BotWorldEntryQueue::ProcessQueue(uint32 maxConcurrent)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the bot world entry queue up to a specified maximum concurrent
    entries.
  description: The ProcessQueue method handles the execution of queued bot world entries,
    managing their processing according to the provided maximum concurrent limit.
    This method is typically invoked during game loop iterations or when bot activity
    needs to be synchronized. It ensures that bot actions are executed in an orderly
    fashion without exceeding system resource limits. The method processes entries
    based on priority and availability, updating internal state as entries are completed
    or fail.
  parameters:
  - name: maxConcurrent
    description: The maximum number of concurrent bot world entries to process in
      this invocation. This parameter controls resource usage and prevents system
      overload by limiting simultaneous operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotWorldEntryQueue queue;

      queue.ProcessQueue(10); // Process up to 10 concurrent entries'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdateBots()\n{\n    static uint32 lastUpdate = 0;\n    uint32 currentTime\
      \ = getMSTime();\n    if (currentTime - lastUpdate > 100)\n    {\n        botQueue.ProcessQueue(5);\n\
      \        lastUpdate = currentTime;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not be called from multiple
    threads simultaneously without proper synchronization. It modifies internal queue
    state and may trigger bot behavior updates. The implementation uses a priority-based
    system for processing entries.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very high maxConcurrent value can lead to performance
    degradation or resource exhaustion. Ensure that the value is appropriate for your
    server's capabilities and bot load.
