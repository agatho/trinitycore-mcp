documentation:
  brief: Satisfies a quest that is at or below the maximum level for the player
  description: This method checks if a quest can be satisfied by the player based
    on their current level and the quest's maximum level requirement. It ensures that
    the quest's requirements are met within the player's level range, allowing them
    to complete the quest without exceeding the maximum level limit. The method returns
    true if the quest can be satisfied, false otherwise, and optionally displays a
    message to the player if specified.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that needs to be satisfied. This parameter
      defines the quest's maximum level requirement and other conditions that must
      be met for the player to complete it.
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether a message should be displayed to
      the player if the quest cannot be satisfied. If true, the method will display
      an appropriate message to inform the player that they cannot satisfy the quest
      due to level restrictions.
  returns: Returns true if the player can satisfy the quest based on their current
    level and the quest's maximum level requirements; otherwise returns false. The
    method does not return null as it is a boolean function.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      bool canSatisfy = player->SatisfyQuestMaxLevel(quest, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nQuest* quest = GetQuestTemplate(12345);\n\
      bool canSatisfy = player->SatisfyQuestMaxLevel(quest, false);\nif (canSatisfy)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with quest completion logic\n} else {\n    // Handle quest\
      \ not being satisfiable\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest completion checks to ensure that
    players do not exceed the maximum level allowed for a quest. It is important to
    note that this method does not actually complete the quest, but rather determines
    whether it can be satisfied based on player's current level.
  warnings: This method should only be called when checking if a quest can be satisfied
    by the player. Calling this method without proper context may lead to incorrect
    quest completion logic or unexpected behavior in quest handling.
