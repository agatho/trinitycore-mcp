  class: CriteriaData
  method: IsValid
  signature: bool CriteriaData::IsValid(const Criteria * criteria)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the criteria data is properly initialized and meets all
    required conditions for use in achievement tracking.
  description: The IsValid method checks if a CriteriaData object contains valid and
    complete information necessary for processing achievements or criteria-based rewards
    within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that all required fields are populated,
    references are valid, and internal state conforms to expected constraints. This
    validation is crucial before attempting to evaluate or apply criteria in game
    systems such as achievements, quests, or player progress tracking. The method
    typically performs checks on data integrity, reference consistency, and logical
    completeness of the criteria definition.
  parameters:
  - name: criteria
    description: Pointer to the Criteria object being validated. Must not be null
      for a meaningful validation check.
  returns: Returns true if the criteria data is valid and can be safely used in achievement
    or progress tracking systems; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "CriteriaData data;\nCriteria* crit = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(12345);\n\
      if (data.IsValid(crit)) {\n    // Proceed with achievement processing\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      achievement\", \"Criteria {} is valid for processing.\", crit->ID);\n} else\
      \ {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"achievement\", \"Invalid criteria data detected for ID\
      \ {}.\", crit->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Achievement Handler
    code: "bool AchievementHandler::ProcessCriteria(CriteriaData& criteriaData, Player*\
      \ player) {\n    Criteria* criteria = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(criteriaData.GetCriteriaId());\n\
      \    if (!criteria || !criteriaData.IsValid(criteria)) {\n        return false;\n\
      \    }\n    // Continue with valid criteria processing\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform expensive validation checks including database lookups
    or complex state comparisons. It should not be called excessively in performance-critical
    code paths. The validation logic might vary depending on the specific type of
    criteria being checked (e.g., kill, quest completion, item collection).
  warnings: Never assume that a CriteriaData object is valid without calling this
    method first. Using invalid criteria data can lead to crashes or incorrect achievement
    progression in the game.
