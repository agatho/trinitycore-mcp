  brief: Processes delayed operations for the player, handling queued actions and
    events
  description: This method processes all delayed operations that have been queued
    for the player, including combat actions, spell effects, and other game mechanics
    that require processing at a specific time. It ensures that pending actions are
    executed in the correct order and timing, maintaining game balance and preventing
    potential exploits or inconsistencies. The method typically runs during each update
    cycle to handle any delayed events that may have occurred during previous frames.

    code: "void Player::ProcessDelayedOperations() {\n    // This method is called\
      \ automatically during update cycle\n    // No explicit call needed\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine during each
    update cycle. It's important to understand that it processes all delayed operations,
    including combat actions and spell effects, which may be queued due to timing
    constraints or other factors.
