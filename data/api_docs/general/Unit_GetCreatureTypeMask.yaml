  method: GetCreatureTypeMask
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetCreatureTypeMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the creature type mask for the unit, indicating its classification
    as a specific type of creature.
  description: The GetCreatureTypeMask method retrieves the creature type mask associated
    with a Unit object, which defines the creature's classification within the game's
    creature type system. This mask is used to determine how the creature behaves
    in various contexts, such as whether it is a beast, dragon, elemental, etc. The
    method is commonly used for identifying creature types during combat or interaction
    logic. It returns a bitmask that represents the creature's type classification
    and can be used in conditional checks to determine specific creature behaviors
    or interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the creature type mask, which indicates
    the specific classification of the creature. This mask is composed of bits that
    represent different creature types (beast, dragon, elemental, etc.), and can be
    used to determine how the creature interacts with certain mechanics or spells.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 typeMask = unit->GetCreatureTypeMask();\nif (typeMask & CREATURE_TYPE_MASK_BEAST)\n\
      {\n    // Handle beast-specific behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature-related
    methods to determine creature behavior. It's important to note that the mask value
    may vary depending on the creature's type and can be modified by game mechanics
    or updates.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method as it might not always reflect the actual
    creature type if the creature has been modified through game effects or transformations.
    Also, ensure proper bitwise operations are used when checking against the mask
    values.
