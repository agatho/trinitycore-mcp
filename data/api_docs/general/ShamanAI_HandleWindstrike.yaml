  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandleWindstrike
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleWindstrike(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to cast Windstrike spell on a target and returns success status.
  description: The HandleWindstrike method is responsible for executing the Windstrike
    spell logic within the ShamanAI class. It determines whether the spell can be
    cast, selects an appropriate target from the current threat list or nearby enemies,
    and initiates the casting process. The method evaluates combat conditions such
    as mana availability, spell cooldowns, and target validity before proceeding with
    the spell execution. This method is typically invoked during AI decision-making
    cycles to apply offensive abilities based on tactical situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Windstrike spell was successfully initiated or cast,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate insufficient mana, invalid
    target, cooldown restrictions, or other casting failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandleWindstrike(nullptr)) {\n    // Windstrike was cast\
      \ successfully\n    // Perform any post-cast actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the underlying spell system and combat
    state management of TrinityCore. It may be part of a larger rotation or ability
    selection logic that considers multiple factors like target distance, threat level,
    and resource conservation.
  warnings: The method signature shows an int* parameter named 'target', but the actual
    implementation details are unknown. This could potentially be a pointer to a target
    GUID or a direct reference to a unit object, so care should be taken when interpreting
    its usage in different contexts.
