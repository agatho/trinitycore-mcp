  class: SmartAI

  signature: bool SmartAI::IsAIControlled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is currently controlled by SmartAI.
  description: The IsAIControlled method checks if a creature's AI behavior is managed
    by the SmartAI system. This is typically used to verify that a creature's actions
    are being handled through the SmartAI framework rather than default vanilla AI
    or other custom AI implementations. The method returns true when the creature
    is actively controlled by SmartAI, and false otherwise. This check is essential
    for ensuring proper integration with SmartAI events and behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is currently controlled by SmartAI, false
    if it is not or if the AI system is disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check AI control
    code: "if (creature->GetAI()->IsAIControlled()) {\n    // Creature is controlled\
      \ by SmartAI\n    // Proceed with SmartAI-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in event handling
    code: "void OnCreatureEnterCombat(Unit* who) {\n    if (me->GetAI()->IsAIControlled())\
      \ {\n        // Custom SmartAI combat behavior\n        DoSmartAICombat();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Fallback to default AI behavior\n        me->SetInCombatWith(who);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by SmartAI for state management
    and should not be called frequently in performance-critical code paths. The result
    may change during runtime if AI control is dynamically switched between different
    AI systems.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method's return value for critical gameplay
    logic, as it may not reflect the actual AI behavior if the creature has been manually
    overridden or if AI switching occurs during execution.
