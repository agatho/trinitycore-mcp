documentation:
  brief: Returns the generated path data for navigation purposes
  description: The GetPath method retrieves the computed navigation path that was
    previously calculated by the PathGenerator. This method provides access to the
    sequence of waypoints that define the optimal route from a starting point to a
    destination. The returned reference allows direct access to the internal path
    data structure, which is typically used by AI systems or movement controllers
    to guide units through complex environments. The path data is usually generated
    using pathfinding algorithms like A* and stored in an internal buffer for efficient
    retrieval during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer array representing the path waypoints.
    Each element in the array corresponds to a coordinate or node in the navigation
    graph that defines the path. The exact interpretation of these integers depends
    on the underlying pathfinding implementation and may represent either X/Y coordinates,
    node indices, or other internal path identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Retrieval
    code: "PathGenerator pathGen;\n// Assume path has been previously calculated\n\
      const int& path = pathGen.GetPath();\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < path.size(); ++i)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"Waypoint \" << i << \": \" << path[i] << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference, meaning the returned data should not
    be modified directly. The path data is only valid until the next call to PathGenerator
    methods that might invalidate or regenerate the path. Developers should ensure
    proper synchronization if accessing this from multiple threads.
  warnings: Accessing the path data through this method provides direct access to
    internal buffers. Modifying the returned reference could lead to undefined behavior
    or corruption of the pathfinding system. Always check if a valid path exists before
    calling this method, as invalid paths may result in empty or corrupted data.
