documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has access to a specific instance based on their current
    instance count.
  description: This method determines whether a player has the necessary permissions
    or access to enter a particular instance. It typically checks against the player's
    current instance count, which represents how many instances they have completed
    or are allowed to enter. The method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to enforce instance access rules and prevent players from entering restricted
    areas without proper clearance. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    game balance and preventing exploits related to instance entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has access to the specified instance, false
    otherwise. The method may also return false if the instance ID is invalid or if
    the player's current instance count does not meet requirements for accessing that
    specific instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Instance Access Check
    code: "if (player->CheckInstanceCount(1234)) {\n    // Player has access to instance\
      \ 1234\n    // Proceed with instance entry logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method may internally check against
    the player's instance lockout data or current instance count stored in their character
    database. Performance considerations include potential database queries when checking
    instance access, especially for players with many completed instances. Thread
    safety is generally not an issue as this method is typically called from within
    a single thread context.
  warnings: Players may be unable to enter certain instances if they do not meet the
    required instance count criteria. This method should not be used to bypass instance
    restrictions or access rules, as it's designed to enforce game mechanics rather
    than allow unrestricted entry.
