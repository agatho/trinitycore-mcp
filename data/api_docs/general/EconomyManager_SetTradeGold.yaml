documentation:
  brief: Sets the gold amount for a trade session
  description: The SetTradeGold method configures the total gold amount that will
    be involved in a player's trade transaction. This method is typically used within
    the context of a trade window where players are exchanging items and gold. It
    validates the provided gold amount against game rules and system limits before
    applying the value. The method ensures that the trade gold is properly initialized
    or updated during the trading process, maintaining consistency with the player's
    inventory and the trade mechanics of World of Warcraft. This function may be called
    multiple times during a trade session to adjust the gold amount as players negotiate.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the gold amount was successfully set and validated; returns
    false if the amount exceeds system limits, is invalid, or if the trade session
    is in an inappropriate state for modification.
  examples:
  - title: Setting Trade Gold Amount
    code: "EconomyManager* economyMgr = player->GetEconomyManager();\nuint64 tradeGold\
      \ = 1000000; // 100 gold\nbool success = economyMgr->SetTradeGold(tradeGold);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Gold amount successfully set for trade\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Trade gold set to %u\", tradeGold);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to set trade\
      \ gold\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to set trade gold amount\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's current trade session state
    and may perform validation checks against the maximum allowed gold in a single
    trade. It should only be called when a trade is actively in progress, and the
    gold amount must be within the valid range of the game's economy system.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active trade session may result in undefined
    behavior or failure to set the value. Additionally, extremely large gold values
    might be rejected by the system due to overflow protection or server configuration
    limits.
