  class: PhasingHandler
  method: InDbPhaseShift
  signature: bool PhasingHandler::InDbPhaseShift(const WorldObject * object, uint8
    phaseUseFlags, uint16 phaseId, uint32 phaseGroupId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a WorldObject is present in the database phase shift data for the
    specified phase group and flags.
  description: The InDbPhaseShift method determines whether a given WorldObject is
    included in the database-defined phase shift information for a specific phase
    ID and phase group. This functionality is crucial for determining visibility and
    interaction logic within phased environments in TrinityCore. The method evaluates
    the object's phase data against configured phase groups and flags to decide if
    it should be considered part of that particular phase context. It is typically
    used during phase-related operations such as player visibility checks, object
    spawning logic, or conditional event triggers based on phase states.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject being checked for phase shift inclusion.
      Must not be null.
  - name: phaseUseFlags
    description: Flags indicating how the phase should be used (e.g., whether it's
      a normal phase, a phase that affects visibility, etc.).
  - name: phaseId
    description: The specific phase ID to check against. Represents a unique identifier
      for a phase state.
  - name: phaseGroupId
    description: The group ID associated with the phase. Used to categorize phases
      and manage related objects.
  returns: Returns true if the WorldObject is found in the database phase shift data
    for the specified parameters; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of InDbPhaseShift
    code: "if (PhasingHandler::InDbPhaseShift(player, PHASE_USE_FLAGS_NORMAL, 12345,\
      \ 67890)) {\n    // Player is in the specified phase shift\n    // Proceed with\
      \ phase-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple phase conditions
    code: "bool isInPhase = PhasingHandler::InDbPhaseShift(player, PHASE_USE_FLAGS_VISIBILITY,\
      \ 12345, 67890);\nbool isNotInPhase = !PhasingHandler::InDbPhaseShift(player,\
      \ PHASE_USE_FLAGS_NORMAL, 12345, 67890);\n\nif (isInPhase && isNotInPhase) {\n\
      \    // Handle special case where player is in visibility phase but not normal\
      \ phase\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on database entries for phase shift information and may
    involve database queries or cached lookups depending on implementation. Performance
    can be affected if large numbers of objects are checked frequently without optimization.
    The method should only be called when the object's phase data is relevant to the
    current context.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters passed are valid and non-null, especially the
    'object' parameter. Incorrect use of phase IDs or group IDs may lead to unexpected
    behavior in phased environments. Avoid calling this method excessively in performance-critical
    code paths without caching results.
