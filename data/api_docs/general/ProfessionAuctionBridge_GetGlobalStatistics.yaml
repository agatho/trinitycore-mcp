documentation:
  brief: Retrieves global statistics for profession auctions across the entire game
    world.
  description: The GetGlobalStatistics method returns a constant reference to a ProfessionAuctionStatistics
    object that contains aggregated data about all profession auctions occurring in
    the game. This includes information such as total auction count, average bid amounts,
    highest sold item prices, and other global metrics relevant to the auction house
    system for crafting professions. The returned statistics are updated periodically
    based on auction activity and reflect the overall state of the profession auction
    market. This method does not modify any internal state and can be called safely
    from any thread context where the ProfessionAuctionBridge instance is accessible.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a ProfessionAuctionStatistics object containing
    global auction metrics for all crafting professions across the game world. The
    statistics include counts, price averages, and other relevant data points that
    summarize the collective auction activity.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Global Auction Statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = auctionBridge.GetGlobalStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total Auctions: " << stats.totalAuctions << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Average Bid: " << stats.averageBid << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Highest Sale: " << stats.highestSalePrice << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned statistics object is immutable and should not be modified directly.
    The data within may be updated asynchronously in response to auction events, so
    repeated calls might return different values over time. This method does not perform
    any I/O operations or database queries directly; it returns cached or precomputed
    values.
