    std::string & name) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a cached character entry by its name from the character cache.
  description: The GetCharacterCacheByName method searches the internal character
    cache for an entry matching the specified player name. It returns a pointer to
    the cached character data if found, or nullptr if no matching entry exists. This
    method is commonly used to quickly access pre-fetched character information without
    requiring additional database queries. The returned pointer is valid only as long
    as the cache entry remains in memory and should not be modified directly. The
    cache is typically populated during server startup or when characters are first
    accessed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a CharacterCacheEntry object if a matching character
    is found in the cache, otherwise nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const CharacterCacheEntry* entry = CharacterCache::GetCharacterCacheByName(\"\
      PlayerName\");\nif (entry != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the cached character data\n\
      \    uint32 guid = entry->guid;\n    std::string name = entry->name;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "const CharacterCacheEntry* entry = CharacterCache::GetCharacterCacheByName(\"\
      SomePlayer\");\nif (entry && entry->guid > 0)\n{\n    // Process valid character\
      \ data\n    printf(\"Found character: %s (GUID: %u)\\n\", entry->name.c_str(),\
      \ entry->guid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Character not found in cache.\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation using an internal hash map or similar
    data structure for O(1) average case performance. The character cache is typically
    populated during server initialization and may be updated when new characters
    are created or existing ones are modified. This method is thread-safe as long
    as the underlying cache implementation handles concurrent access properly.
  warnings: The returned pointer becomes invalid if the cache entry is removed or
    the cache is cleared. Do not store pointers to cached entries for extended periods.
    Ensure that the character name passed is properly sanitized to prevent potential
    lookup issues with special characters or malformed names.
