documentation:
  brief: Updates transport visibility for a player on the map
  description: This method sends transport visibility updates to a player, ensuring
    that the player's client receives accurate information about transport objects
    in their vicinity. It is used during map loading and transport movement to maintain
    proper client synchronization with server-side transport data. The method handles
    the communication of transport-related visibility information between the server
    and client, particularly important for maintaining correct player positioning
    and interaction with transport objects.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose transport visibility needs to
      be updated
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      Player* player = new Player();

      map->SendUpdateTransportVisibility(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during map initialization and transport movement
    events. It may be invoked multiple times per frame depending on transport movement
    and player position changes. Performance considerations include the frequency
    of updates and potential impact on client synchronization.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context, as it's
    primarily used internally by the server for maintaining transport visibility.
    Incorrect usage could lead to client desynchronization or incorrect transport
    positioning.
