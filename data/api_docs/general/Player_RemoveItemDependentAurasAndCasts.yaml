  class: Player
  method: RemoveItemDependentAurasAndCasts
  signature: void Player::RemoveItemDependentAurasAndCasts(Item * pItem)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all auras and casts that are dependent on a specific item from the
    player.
  description: This method removes all aura effects and spell casts that are dependent
    on a given item from the player's character. It is typically used when an item
    is removed from equipment or when an item is destroyed, ensuring that any buffs,
    debuffs, or spell effects tied to the item are properly cleared. The method handles
    both active and passive auras that may be linked to the item's properties, such
    as enchantments, set bonuses, or other item-based effects. This ensures that the
    player's character state remains consistent when items change.
  parameters:
  - name: pItem
    description: Pointer to the Item object from which dependent auras and casts are
      to be removed. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nItem* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 0);\n\
      if (item)\n{\n    player->RemoveItemDependentAurasAndCasts(item);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during item removal or destruction processes
    to ensure proper cleanup of item-dependent effects. It may involve multiple internal
    calls to remove auras and casts, and it's important to note that this method does
    not directly remove the item itself from inventory; it only removes dependent
    effects.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when removing items from equipment
    or inventory, as it can affect character state and potentially cause unexpected
    behavior if used incorrectly. It is recommended to ensure the item exists before
    calling this method.
