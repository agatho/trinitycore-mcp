  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Player::LoadWeeklyQuestStatus() {\n    // This method is called internally\
      \ during player login\n    // No direct call needed - it's part of the player\
      \ initialization process\n    // The method handles database loading and parsing\
      \ of weekly quest data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the player's initialization process
    and should not be called directly by other methods. It involves database operations
    that may impact performance if called frequently. The method uses a database result
    parameter to handle query results from the database.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by other code - it's part of
    the internal player initialization process. Calling it manually could cause data
    inconsistencies or duplicate loading issues.
