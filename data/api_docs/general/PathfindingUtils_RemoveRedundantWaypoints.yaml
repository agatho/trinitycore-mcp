  method: RemoveRedundantWaypoints
  signature: int PathfindingUtils::RemoveRedundantWaypoints(const int & waypoints)
documentation:
  brief: Removes redundant waypoints from a path to optimize navigation.
  description: The RemoveRedundantWaypoints method processes a list of waypoints and
    eliminates unnecessary intermediate points that do not contribute to the overall
    path validity or efficiency. This optimization is crucial for performance in World
    of Warcraft's pathfinding system, particularly when dealing with complex terrain
    or dynamic environments where paths may contain overlapping or duplicate points.
    The method ensures that only essential waypoints are retained, reducing computational
    overhead during movement calculations and improving AI behavior responsiveness.
    It operates on the internal waypoint structure of the PathfindingUtils class and
    modifies the waypoint list in-place.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of waypoints removed from the
    path. A return value of zero indicates no redundant waypoints were found, while
    a positive integer indicates the count of waypoints that were successfully eliminated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Waypoint Optimization
    code: "PathfindingUtils pathfinder;\nint removed = pathfinder.RemoveRedundantWaypoints();\n\
      if (removed > 0) {\n    printf(\"Removed %d redundant waypoints\\n\", removed);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after generating a path to improve performance.
    The optimization process may involve checking for collinear points, duplicate
    coordinates, or waypoints that are too close together to provide meaningful navigation
    guidance. It's recommended to call this method before using the waypoint list
    for actual movement calculations.
  warnings: The method modifies the internal waypoint structure directly, so calling
    it multiple times on the same path without re-generating it may lead to unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that the waypoint data is valid and properly initialized before
    invoking this method.
