documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new PathResult object with default values.
  description: The PathResult constructor initializes a new instance of the PathResult
    class. This constructor sets up the internal state of the path result object,
    preparing it for use in pathfinding operations within the TrinityCore framework.
    The object is typically used to store and manage the results of path calculations
    performed by the navigation system. It initializes all member variables to their
    default states, ensuring that subsequent operations on the object behave predictably.
    This constructor is usually invoked automatically when creating PathResult instances,
    either explicitly or implicitly during pathfinding algorithm execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PathResult Construction
    code: 'PathResult result;

      // Initializes a new PathResult object with default values'
    language: cpp
  - title: PathResult in Pathfinding Context
    code: "void SomeAIUpdate()\n{\n    PathResult result;\n    // Use result for pathfinding\
      \ operations\n    // The object is now ready for use in navigation calculations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor performs minimal initialization. The actual path data will
    be populated by subsequent pathfinding methods. This class is typically used as
    part of the larger navigation system and may require additional setup before being
    fully functional.
  warnings: This constructor does not validate input parameters since it takes no
    parameters. Developers should ensure that PathResult objects are properly initialized
    with valid path data before attempting to access their contents.
