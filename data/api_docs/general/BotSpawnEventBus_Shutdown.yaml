  method: Shutdown
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Stops and cleans up all active bot spawn events within the event bus.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing bot spawn events managed
    by the BotSpawnEventBus instance. It ensures that any pending or active spawn
    operations are properly halted, resources are released, and the event bus is left
    in a clean state. This method is typically invoked during server shutdown or when
    the bot system needs to be disabled temporarily. The method does not return any
    value and should only be called when no other threads are actively using the event
    bus to prevent race conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: BotSpawnEventBus::instance()->Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes exclusive access to the event bus and should not be called
    concurrently with other methods that modify or query the event bus state. It is
    recommended to call this method before destructing the BotSpawnEventBus instance.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while bot spawn events are actively processing may result
    in incomplete or inconsistent bot creation states. Ensure all pending operations
    are completed or cancelled before invoking this method.
