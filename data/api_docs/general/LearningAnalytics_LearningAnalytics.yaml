documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LearningAnalytics class for tracking player
    learning metrics.
  description: The LearningAnalytics constructor initializes a new instance of the
    LearningAnalytics class, setting up internal data structures and configurations
    needed to track and analyze player learning behaviors within the TrinityCore environment.
    This method prepares the analytics system to collect data on skill acquisition,
    quest completion rates, and other educational progression metrics that are relevant
    for game balance and player engagement analysis. The initialization process typically
    involves allocating memory for tracking arrays, setting default values for statistical
    counters, and preparing event handlers for learning-related events. No specific
    preconditions are required for calling this constructor, as it is designed to
    be invoked during object creation or system initialization.

  - title: Basic Instance Creation
    code: 'LearningAnalytics* analytics = new LearningAnalytics();

      // The analytics object is now ready to track player learning data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new instance of the
    LearningAnalytics class. It is typically invoked during server startup or when
    a new analytics session begins. The initialization may involve memory allocation
    and setup of internal tracking mechanisms that could impact performance if called
    excessively.
