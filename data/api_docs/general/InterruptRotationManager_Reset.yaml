  method: Reset
  signature: void InterruptRotationManager::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the interrupt rotation manager's internal state to its initial condition.
  description: The Reset method clears all active interrupt rotations and resets the
    manager's tracking state. This method is typically invoked when a new combat encounter
    begins or when the rotation system needs to be reinitialized. It ensures that
    any previously scheduled interrupts are cleared and that the manager starts with
    a clean slate for processing new interrupt events. The reset operation does not
    affect other systems or components outside of the interrupt rotation management
    scope.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager* interruptMgr = player->GetInterruptRotationManager();

      interruptMgr->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating a new combat rotation sequence
    to ensure no stale interrupt data interferes with current gameplay logic. It is
    recommended to call Reset() at the start of each new encounter or when switching
    between different interrupt strategies.
