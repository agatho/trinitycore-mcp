  method: SetNeedClientUpdate
  signature: void AuraApplication::SetNeedClientUpdate()
documentation:
  brief: Marks the aura application as requiring an update to the client.
  description: The SetNeedClientUpdate method flags an AuraApplication object to indicate
    that its state has changed and needs to be synchronized with the client. This
    is typically used when aura properties such as duration, stack count, or visual
    effects are modified on the server side. The method sets an internal flag that
    will trigger a client update during the next update cycle. This ensures that players
    see accurate aura information in their user interface, including debuffs, buffs,
    and other status effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking an Aura for Client Update
    code: "AuraApplication* app = player->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (app)\n{\n\
      \    app->SetNeedClientUpdate();\n    // The aura will be updated on the client\
      \ in the next update cycle\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when actual changes to the aura's visible
    state occur. It does not directly send packets to clients but rather marks the
    aura for processing during the next client update cycle. The flag is typically
    cleared automatically after a successful client update.
  warnings: Calling this method excessively without actual changes can lead to unnecessary
    network traffic and performance overhead. Ensure that updates are only triggered
    when meaningful changes occur to prevent unnecessary client synchronization.
