documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another PlayerLootProfile object into this instance.
  description: The PlayerLootProfile move constructor transfers all resources and
    data from the source PlayerLootProfile object to the current instance. This operation
    is typically used when creating a new PlayerLootProfile object by moving an existing
    one, which avoids unnecessary copying of data. The source object becomes invalid
    after the move operation and should not be used. This constructor is part of the
    standard C++ move semantics implementation for the PlayerLootProfile class, enabling
    efficient resource management during object creation and assignment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a PlayerLootProfile
    code: 'PlayerLootProfile profile1;

      // ... populate profile1 with loot data ...

      PlayerLootProfile profile2 = std::move(profile1); // Move profile1 to profile2

      // profile1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is implicitly defined as default in C++11 and later. It's
    important to understand that after moving, the source object should not be accessed
    or used, as its contents have been transferred. The move constructor ensures efficient
    memory management by transferring ownership of internal data structures rather
    than copying them.
  warnings: Do not attempt to use the source PlayerLootProfile object after calling
    this move constructor. Using it afterward results in undefined behavior. This
    is a fundamental aspect of move semantics - once an object is moved from, it's
    left in a valid but unspecified state.
