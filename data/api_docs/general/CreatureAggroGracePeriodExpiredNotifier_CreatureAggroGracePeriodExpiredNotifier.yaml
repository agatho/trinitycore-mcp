  class: CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier
  method: CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier
  signature: void CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier::CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier(int
    & c)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier with a reference to
    an integer counter.
  description: The CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier constructor initializes
    an instance of the class with a reference to an integer parameter 'c'. This notifier
    is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to handle events related to
    creature aggro grace periods expiring. The integer reference 'c' likely represents
    a counter or state variable that tracks the number of creatures whose grace periods
    have expired, or serves as a flag for triggering specific actions when this occurs.
    The constructor sets up internal state to manage these notifications, ensuring
    proper handling of creature behavior changes upon grace period expiration.
  parameters:
  - name: c
    description: Reference to an integer counter that tracks the number of creatures
      with expired aggro grace periods or serves as a state flag for notification
      handling.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'int gracePeriodCounter = 0;

      CreatureAggroGracePeriodExpiredNotifier notifier(gracePeriodCounter);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is likely part of a larger system managing creature AI behavior
    and aggro states in TrinityCore. The integer reference 'c' should be properly
    initialized before passing it to the constructor to avoid undefined behavior.
