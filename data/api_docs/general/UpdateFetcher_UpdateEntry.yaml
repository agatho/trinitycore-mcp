  class: UpdateFetcher
  method: UpdateEntry
  signature: void UpdateFetcher::UpdateEntry(const AppliedFileEntry & entry, const
    uint32 speed) const
documentation:
  brief: Updates an entry in the fetcher with the specified applied file entry and
    speed value.
  description: The UpdateEntry method is responsible for updating a specific entry
    within the UpdateFetcher class using the provided AppliedFileEntry object and
    a speed parameter. This method likely handles synchronization or processing of
    game data updates, where the speed parameter may influence how quickly or efficiently
    the update is applied. The method operates on a const instance, suggesting it's
    designed to modify internal state without changing the object's external interface.
    It is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    for managing file-based updates and data synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The AppliedFileEntry object containing the data to be updated in
      the fetcher. This represents a specific file or data entry that needs to be
      processed or synchronized.
  - name: speed
    description: A uint32 value representing the speed at which the update should
      be processed. This may control throttling, processing rate, or priority of the
      update operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AppliedFileEntry entry;

      // ... populate entry with data ...

      UpdateFetcher fetcher;

      fetcher.UpdateEntry(entry, 1000); // Update with speed of 1000'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for handling file updates or
    data synchronization in TrinityCore. The 'const' qualifier on the method suggests
    it modifies internal state but does not alter the object's externally visible
    properties. Performance considerations may apply depending on how many entries
    are being updated and what operations are performed within the implementation.
