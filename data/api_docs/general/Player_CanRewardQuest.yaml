documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can accept and reward a quest based on their
    current quest status and requirements.
  description: The CanRewardQuest method checks if a player is eligible to receive
    a quest reward. It evaluates the player's current quest status, including quest
    completion requirements, prerequisites, and any necessary items or currency needed
    for the reward. This method is crucial for determining whether a quest can be
    properly rewarded, ensuring that players meet all conditions before receiving
    rewards. The method considers various factors such as quest completion status,
    required items, and player level requirements to validate reward eligibility.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object being evaluated for reward eligibility.
      This parameter defines which quest is being checked.
  - name: rewardType
    description: The type of reward being evaluated (e.g., item, money, experience).
      Valid values include 0-3 for different reward types.
  - name: rewardId
    description: The specific reward ID to check against. This identifies the exact
      reward item or currency being validated.
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to display messages to the player
      if the quest cannot be rewarded. If true, player will receive notification messages.
  returns: Returns true if the player can reward the quest, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the player meets all requirements for quest reward.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Validation
    code: "if (player->CanRewardQuest(quest, 0, 12345, true))\n{\n    // Player can\
      \ reward this quest\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot reward this quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Reward Checking
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nif (player->CanRewardQuest(quest,\
      \ 2, 67890, false))\n{\n    // Player can reward this quest without displaying\
      \ messages\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot reward this quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to validate quest completion and reward eligibility. It may be called during quest
    completion checks or when processing quest rewards. The method considers player's
    current level, inventory space, and quest requirements.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a standalone validation without checking
    the player's quest status first. It does not validate whether the player has completed
    the quest itself, only whether they can reward it after completing it.
