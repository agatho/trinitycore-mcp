documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the artifact power value associated with a specific artifact power
    ID from an item.
  description: This method retrieves the artifact power value for a given artifact
    power ID from an Item object. It is used in World of Warcraft's artifact system
    to access artifact power values that are stored within items, particularly those
    that have been modified through artifact upgrades or other artifact-related mechanics.
    The method returns a pointer to the const int value representing the artifact
    power, allowing developers to access and potentially modify artifact power values
    without directly altering the item's internal state. This functionality is crucial
    for managing artifact progression and understanding how artifact powers contribute
    to the overall artifact system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to a const int representing the artifact power value
    associated with the specified artifactPowerId. If no artifact power is found,
    it returns nullptr. The returned value represents the current artifact power level
    stored in the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Artifact Power Retrieval
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(ITEM_SLOT_MAINHAND);\nconst int* artifactPower\
      \ = item->GetArtifactPower(12345);\nif (artifactPower != nullptr)\n{\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Artifact power value: \" << *artifactPower << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Artifact Power Usage
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(ITEM_SLOT_OFFHAND);\nconst int* artifactPower\
      \ = item->GetArtifactPower(54321);\nif (artifactPower != nullptr)\n{\n    int\
      \ powerValue = *artifactPower;\n    // Use powerValue for artifact progression\
      \ calculations\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where artifact power is not found\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on const data, meaning it does not modify the item's
    state. It is designed to work with artifact power IDs that are typically defined
    in the game's artifact system configuration. The returned pointer should be handled
    carefully to avoid accessing invalid memory.
  warnings: This method may return nullptr if the artifact power ID is not found within
    the item, which could lead to null pointer dereferences if not properly checked.
    Additionally, the method assumes that the item has been properly initialized with
    artifact power data, and may behave unexpectedly if used on items without artifact
    power data.
