api:
  class: Group
  method: AddLeaderInvite
  signature: bool Group::AddLeaderInvite(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the group's leader invite list for group leadership transfer.
  description: The AddLeaderInvite method adds a specified player to the group's leader
    invite list, allowing that player to accept a group leadership transfer. This
    method is typically used when a group leader wants to designate another player
    as the next leader of the group. The method checks if the player is already in
    the group and whether they are eligible for leadership transfer. It returns true
    if the player was successfully added to the invite list, or false if the operation
    failed due to invalid conditions such as the player not being in the group or
    already having an active invitation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will be invited to become the new
      group leader. Must be a valid player instance and must be currently in the group.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully added to the leader invite
    list, false otherwise. The method may return false if the player is not in the
    group or if there are already active invitations for this player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AddLeaderInvite
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindConnectedPlayer(\"TargetPlayer\"\
      );\nif (targetPlayer && group->IsMember(targetPlayer->GetGUID())) {\n    bool\
      \ success = group->AddLeaderInvite(targetPlayer);\n    if (success) {\n    \
      \    // Send a message to the player about the invitation\n        targetPlayer->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      You have been invited to become group leader.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the group leadership system in TrinityCore. It does
    not immediately transfer leadership; it only adds the player to an invite list.
    The actual leadership transfer must be completed by the invited player accepting
    the invitation using a corresponding method like AcceptLeaderInvite.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed into this method is valid and that
    the player is actually a member of the group before calling this method. Passing
    invalid or null pointers will result in undefined behavior.
