  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: SwitchToDefensiveStrategy
  signature: void BattlegroundAI::SwitchToDefensiveStrategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Switches the battleground AI to a defensive strategy for the specified player.
  description: The SwitchToDefensiveStrategy method is used in the BattlegroundAI
    class to transition the AI behavior of a specific player from an offensive stance
    to a defensive one. This typically occurs during battlegrounds where players may
    need to shift their tactics based on the current game state, such as when defending
    objectives or retreating from combat. The method modifies the AI's decision-making
    process to prioritize defensive actions like healing, shielding, or positioning
    for protection rather than aggressive attacks. It is commonly invoked during strategic
    phases of battlegrounds where defensive positioning becomes more critical than
    offensive pushes.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the battleground. This parameter determines which specific player's AI
      strategy will be switched to defensive mode.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground AI
    code: "void MyBattlegroundAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Switch player with\
      \ index 5 to defensive strategy\n    SwitchToDefensiveStrategy(&playerIndex);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Defensive Strategy Switch
    code: "void MyBattlegroundAI::HandlePlayerDeath(Unit* unit)\n{\n    if (unit->GetTypeId()\
      \ == TYPEID_PLAYER)\n    {\n        int player = unit->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \        SwitchToDefensiveStrategy(&player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and should only be called
    within the context of a valid battleground instance. The player parameter must
    point to a valid player index that exists in the current battleground's player
    list. Implementation details may vary depending on how the underlying AI framework
    handles strategy transitions.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer could lead to undefined behavior.
    This method modifies internal AI state and should not be called during critical
    sections where AI decisions are being processed.
