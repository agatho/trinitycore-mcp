  class: RoleAssignment
  method: CalculateClassRoleEffectiveness
  signature: float RoleAssignment::CalculateClassRoleEffectiveness(uint8 playerClass,
    uint8 playerSpec, GroupRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the effectiveness of a player's class and specialization for a
    given role in a group.
  description: The CalculateClassRoleEffectiveness method evaluates how well a specific
    player class and specialization combination performs within a defined group role.
    This calculation is used by TrinityCore's group management system to determine
    optimal role assignments for players, ensuring balanced team compositions. The
    method considers various game mechanics such as class abilities, spec-specific
    talents, and role requirements to return a normalized effectiveness score between
    0.0 and 1.0. A higher value indicates better suitability for the specified role,
    while a lower value suggests poor fit. This function is typically called during
    group creation or reassignment processes to help maintain balanced gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: The player's class identifier (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR = 1, CLASS_MAGE
      = 8). Must be a valid class enum value from TrinityCore's class definitions.
  - name: playerSpec
    description: The player's specialization index within their class. For example,
      for Warriors, this could be 0 (Arms), 1 (Fury), or 2 (Protection). Must be a
      valid spec index for the given class.
  - name: role
    description: The group role to evaluate effectiveness for (e.g., ROLE_TANK, ROLE_HEALER,
      ROLE_DAMAGE). This determines what type of gameplay contribution is being assessed.
  returns: Returns a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the effectiveness
    of the player's class/spec combination for the specified role. A value of 1.0
    indicates perfect fit, while 0.0 indicates no suitability for that role.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float effectiveness = roleAssignment.CalculateClassRoleEffectiveness(CLASS_WARRIOR,
      0, ROLE_TANK);

      // Returns effectiveness score for Arms Warrior as a tank'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Evaluations
    code: 'float tankScore = roleAssignment.CalculateClassRoleEffectiveness(CLASS_PRIEST,
      1, ROLE_TANK);

      float healerScore = roleAssignment.CalculateClassRoleEffectiveness(CLASS_PRIEST,
      1, ROLE_HEALER);

      // Compare scores to determine best role assignment for Holy Priest'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's dynamic group role assignment system.
    The effectiveness calculation may be influenced by server configuration settings
    and expansion-specific rules. It should not be called in performance-critical
    sections due to its internal complexity involving class and spec data lookups.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters; invalid class or spec values
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure that playerClass and
    playerSpec are within expected ranges for the current expansion before calling
    this method.
