documentation:
  brief: Advances to the next cinematic camera in the current cinematic sequence.
  description: The NextCinematicCamera method is responsible for progressing through
    a cinematic sequence by advancing to the next camera view. This method is typically
    invoked during cinematic events to transition between different camera angles
    or positions, ensuring smooth visual storytelling. It manages the internal state
    of the cinematic manager and updates the active camera accordingly. The method
    does not accept any parameters and performs no direct return operations, instead
    relying on the CinematicMgr's internal tracking of cinematic progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Cinematic Event
    code: "void OnCinematicStart(Player* player)\n{\n    // Start a cinematic sequence\n\
      \    player->GetCinematicMgr()->NextCinematicCamera();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CinematicMgr's internal state management and should
    be called only during active cinematic sequences. It assumes that a valid cinematic
    sequence has been initialized and that the next camera in the sequence exists.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active cinematic sequence may result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure proper initialization of the cinematic
    manager before invoking this function.
