  method: SetLoadShedThreshold
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::SetLoadShedThreshold(uint32 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the load shedding threshold for bot performance monitoring in microseconds.
  description: The SetLoadShedThreshold method configures the maximum allowed execution
    time for bot operations before the system begins shedding load to maintain server
    stability. This threshold is measured in microseconds and determines when bots
    will start reducing their activity or pausing non-critical tasks. The method directly
    affects how aggressively the performance monitor will intervene when bot processing
    exceeds acceptable limits, helping prevent server overload during high-traffic
    periods or when individual bots become resource-intensive.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The maximum allowed execution time for bot operations before load
      shedding is triggered. Valid values are typically in the range of 1000 to 1000000
      microseconds (1ms to 1000ms). Lower values result in more aggressive load shedding
      behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Load Shed Threshold to 500 Microseconds
    code: BotPerformanceMonitor::SetLoadShedThreshold(500);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure High-Performance Threshold for Critical Bots
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = BotPerformanceMonitor::GetSingleton();

      monitor->SetLoadShedThreshold(10000); // 10ms threshold for high-priority bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during server initialization or configuration
    changes. The value set affects all bots managed by the performance monitor and
    influences how the system handles bot resource contention. Changes to this threshold
    may require server restart to fully propagate in some configurations.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may cause bots to frequently shed load, reducing
    their effectiveness. Setting it too high may lead to server instability during
    peak bot activity periods. The optimal value depends on server hardware capabilities
    and expected bot workload.
