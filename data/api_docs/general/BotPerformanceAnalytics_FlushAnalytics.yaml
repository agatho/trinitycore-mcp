documentation:
  brief: Flushes accumulated bot performance analytics data to persistent storage
    or reporting system
  description: The FlushAnalytics method is responsible for committing any buffered
    or cached bot performance metrics to a permanent storage location or external
    reporting system. This method ensures that real-time performance data collected
    by the BotPerformanceAnalytics subsystem is persisted for later analysis, debugging,
    or monitoring purposes. The operation typically occurs at predefined intervals
    or upon specific triggers within the TrinityCore framework's AI management system.
    It may involve writing to log files, database entries, or sending telemetry data
    to external services depending on the configuration and implementation details
    of the analytics subsystem.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Manager
    code: "void AIManager::UpdateBots()\n{\n    // ... bot logic ...\n    sBotPerformanceAnalytics->FlushAnalytics();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server shutdown, periodic maintenance
    intervals, or when significant performance thresholds are reached. The flush operation
    may be blocking and could impact performance if large amounts of data need to
    be written. It's recommended to call this method sparingly in high-frequency update
    loops.
  warnings: Calling FlushAnalytics too frequently can cause performance degradation
    due to I/O operations. Ensure that the underlying storage mechanism can handle
    burst writes without causing system instability or data corruption.
