documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently in a raid group
  description: The IsInRaid method checks if the player associated with this combat
    specialization instance is currently part of a raid group. This method returns
    true if the player is in a raid (either as a raid leader or raid member), and
    false if the player is in a party but not a raid, or if the player is solo. The
    check is performed against the current player's group status within the game world.
    This functionality is commonly used in combat specializations to determine appropriate
    behavior or abilities based on group composition.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is in a raid group, false otherwise. A raid
    group is defined as a group with 5 or more players, typically used for raid encounters
    in World of Warcraft.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check raid status
    code: "if (combatSpec->IsInRaid()) {\n    // Player is in a raid, enable raid-specific\
      \ abilities\n    player->CastSpell(target, RAID_ABILITY_SPELL_ID, true);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Player is not in a raid, use solo abilities\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SOLO_ABILITY_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsInRaid in combat logic
    code: "class MyCombatSpec : public CombatSpecializationBase {\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnCombatStart(Unit* target) override {\n        if (IsInRaid()) {\n      \
      \      // Apply raid-specific buffs or adjustments\n            ApplyRaidBuffs();\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Apply solo combat adjustments\n          \
      \  ApplySoloAdjustments();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current group membership status. It will
    return false for players in a 5-player dungeon or battleground, even if they are
    in a group. The method does not distinguish between different raid types (e.g.,
    normal vs heroic raids) - it only checks for presence in any raid group.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns false for players in 5-player instances
    such as dungeons or battlegrounds, which may be unexpected when checking for group
    composition. The method should not be used to determine if a player is in a specific
    type of raid encounter, only whether they are in any raid group.
