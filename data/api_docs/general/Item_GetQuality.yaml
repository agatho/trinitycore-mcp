documentation:
  brief: Returns the quality level of the item
  description: The GetQuality method retrieves the quality value of an Item object,
    which determines the item's rarity and visual appearance in World of Warcraft.
    This value is used internally by the game engine to categorize items into different
    quality levels such as poor, common, rare, epic, and legendary. The method returns
    a uint32 representing the quality level, with higher values indicating better
    quality items. This functionality is essential for item management, loot distribution,
    and player progression within the game.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the item's quality level. Values typically
    range from 0 to 7, where 0 represents 'Poor' quality, 1 'Common', 2 'Rare', 3
    'Epic', and so forth up to 7 which represents 'Legendary'. The exact values depend
    on the game version and internal configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID("1234567890ABCDEF");

      uint32 quality = item->GetQuality();

      // quality will be 3 for an epic item'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context within the
    game engine. Performance impact is minimal as it simply accesses a stored value
    in the Item object's data structure.
  warnings: The quality value returned by this method may vary depending on the expansion
    level and game version, so developers should ensure compatibility with their target
    environment when using this method.
