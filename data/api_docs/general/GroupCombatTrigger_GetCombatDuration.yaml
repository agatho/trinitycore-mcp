  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: GetCombatDuration
  signature: uint32 GroupCombatTrigger::GetCombatDuration(Group * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total combat duration for all members of a specified
    group.
  description: The GetCombatDuration method determines the cumulative time that all
    players within a given group have spent in combat. This function is typically
    used in game mechanics related to group-based achievements, loot distribution
    timing, or player activity tracking. It aggregates individual combat timers from
    each group member and returns the total duration in milliseconds. The method assumes
    that combat state tracking is properly maintained for each player in the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total combat duration in milliseconds
    for all members of the specified group. If the group is invalid or contains no
    players, the method returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 totalDuration = GroupCombatTrigger::GetCombatDuration(myGroup);

      TC_LOG_INFO("combat", "Total group combat duration: %u ms", totalDuration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate tracking of individual player combat states.
    The implementation may cache results for performance reasons, but it will recalculate
    when necessary to ensure up-to-date values. Ensure that the group pointer is valid
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid group pointer may result in
    undefined behavior or incorrect calculations. Always verify that the group exists
    and contains active players before invoking this function.
