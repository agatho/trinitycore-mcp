  method: UpdateCooldownStates
  signature: void RestorationDruidRefactored::UpdateCooldownStates()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all abilities and spells used by the restoration
    druid.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers associated with all applicable abilities and spells within
    the Restoration Druid's spellbook. This method ensures that each ability's cooldown
    status is accurately reflected in the game state, preventing players from using
    spells before their cooldown periods have expired. It typically iterates through
    the druid's active cooldowns, checks if any have completed, and updates their
    availability accordingly. The method plays a crucial role in maintaining game
    balance by enforcing proper spell usage timing and preventing exploitation of
    abilities.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void RestorationDruidRefactored::UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    // ... combat\
      \ logic ...\n    UpdateCooldownStates();\n    // ... continue with other updates\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the druid's update cycle, typically
    every tick or at specific intervals. It is important to note that this method
    does not directly trigger spell casting but rather manages the cooldown state
    of spells that may be cast later. The implementation likely involves checking
    internal cooldown tracking structures and updating their remaining times.
  warnings: Improper handling of cooldown states can lead to game balance issues or
    player frustration if abilities become available too early or remain on cooldown
    longer than intended. Ensure this method is called consistently during the update
    loop to maintain accurate state management.
