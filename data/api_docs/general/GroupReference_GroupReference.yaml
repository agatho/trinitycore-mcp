documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GroupReference object with default values
  description: The GroupReference constructor initializes a new instance of the GroupReference
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the reference to point to a valid
    group, typically initializing member variables to their default or null states.
    In the context of TrinityCore's group management system, this constructor is used
    when creating new group references that will be used to track and manage player
    groups within the game world. The initialization ensures that the reference is
    in a consistent state before being used for group operations such as adding members,
    checking group validity, or performing group-related actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GroupReference instance
    code: 'GroupReference* reference = new GroupReference();

      // The reference is now initialized and ready to be used

      // with group management functions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating new group references. Developers should not normally need to explicitly
    call this constructor unless they are implementing custom group reference handling
    code. The constructor ensures proper initialization of internal data structures
    that maintain group membership and state information.
