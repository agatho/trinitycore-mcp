documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the guild bank layout by reorganizing items for improved efficiency
    and accessibility.
  description: The OptimizeGuildBankLayout method in the GuildIntegration class is
    responsible for reorganizing the contents of a guild's bank to improve item management
    and accessibility. This function typically rearranges items based on predefined
    criteria such as item type, rarity, or usage frequency to ensure that frequently
    accessed items are positioned for quick retrieval. The optimization process may
    involve moving items between different slots within the guild bank, potentially
    sorting them alphabetically or by category. This method is particularly useful
    in large guilds where managing a vast inventory can become cumbersome without
    proper organization.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who initiated the optimization request. This parameter determines which
      guild's bank layout will be optimized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration::OptimizeGuildBankLayout(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nif (playerId > 0) {\n    GuildIntegration::OptimizeGuildBankLayout(&playerId);\n\
      \    // Additional logic after optimization\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ player ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the guild's bank storage system and may
    trigger UI updates to reflect the new layout. It should be called only when necessary
    as it might involve significant processing for large guild banks.
  warnings: Ensure that the player ID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    guild member, otherwise the operation may fail or produce unexpected results.
    This method may not be thread-safe if multiple players attempt to optimize the
    same guild bank simultaneously.
