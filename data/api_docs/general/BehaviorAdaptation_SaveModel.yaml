  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: SaveModel
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::SaveModel(uint32_t botGuid, const std::string
    & filename)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the behavior model of a bot to a specified file
  description: The SaveModel method persists the current behavioral state and configuration
    of a bot identified by its GUID into a file with the provided filename. This functionality
    is typically used for saving custom AI behaviors or training data for bots in
    TrinityCore's AI system. The method likely serializes internal bot state variables,
    decision-making parameters, and learned behaviors to disk for later retrieval.
    It may be invoked during bot shutdown, manual save operations, or as part of automated
    training processes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose behavior model is to be
      saved
  - name: filename
    description: Path and name of the file where the bot's behavior model will be
      stored
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation behavior;

      behavior.SaveModel(12345, "bot_behavior_12345.json");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Saving Multiple Bot Models
    code: "for (uint32_t i = 0; i < botCount; ++i)\n{\n    std::string filename =\
      \ \"bot_behavior_\" + std::to_string(i) + \".json\";\n    behavior.SaveModel(i,\
      \ filename);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs serialization of internal bot state data structures
    to a persistent format. The exact file format (JSON, binary, etc.) is not specified
    but would typically be compatible with the corresponding LoadModel functionality.
    Implementation may involve locking mechanisms or thread safety considerations
    if called from multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the filename path is valid and writable before calling this
    method. If the bot with the specified GUID does not exist or has no behavior model
    data, the operation may fail silently or throw an exception depending on implementation
    details.
