  method: CancelSceneBySceneId
  signature: void SceneMgr::CancelSceneBySceneId(uint32 sceneId)
documentation:
  brief: Cancels a scene instance identified by its unique scene ID.
  description: The CancelSceneBySceneId method terminates an active scene instance
    within the World of Warcraft client, identified by its unique scene ID. This function
    is typically used to stop ongoing cinematic sequences, quest-related cutscenes,
    or any other scene-based events that are currently playing for a player. The method
    ensures that all associated resources related to the scene are properly released
    and that the player's state is restored to normal gameplay conditions. It is important
    to note that this operation affects only the specific scene instance identified
    by the provided ID and does not interfere with other active scenes or gameplay
    elements.
  parameters:
  - name: sceneId
    description: A unique identifier for the scene instance to be canceled. This value
      corresponds to the scene ID assigned when the scene was initiated, typically
      through methods like SceneMgr::PlaySceneBySceneId or similar scene-starting
      functions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Cancel a specific scene by its ID
    code: 'uint32 mySceneId = 12345;

      sceneMgr->CancelSceneBySceneId(mySceneId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cancel scene when quest completion triggers scene cancellation
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    if (questId\
      \ == 1001)\n    {\n        sceneMgr->CancelSceneBySceneId(54321);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active scenes that have been previously
    started. Calling it with an invalid or non-existent scene ID may result in no
    effect but will not cause errors. Scene cancellation is immediate and does not
    wait for the scene to complete naturally.
  warnings: Ensure that the scene ID passed to this function is valid and corresponds
    to an actual active scene; otherwise, calling this method may have no effect.
    Also, be cautious when canceling scenes during critical gameplay events as it
    could disrupt player experience or quest progression.
