  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: RemoveBotFromZone
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::RemoveBotFromZone(uint32 zoneId, int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific bot from the specified zone in the bot population manager.
  description: The RemoveBotFromZone method is responsible for removing a bot identified
    by its GUID from a particular zone within the bot population system. This function
    ensures that the bot is no longer managed or active in the specified zone, which
    may be necessary when bots are killed, despawned, or need to be relocated. The
    method operates on the internal data structures of the BotPopulationManager to
    update the zone's bot list and maintain consistency across the system. It does
    not perform any validation on the provided zoneId or botGuid, so callers should
    ensure these values are valid before invoking this method.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone from which the bot will be removed.
      This value corresponds to a valid zone in the game world.
  - name: botGuid
    description: The global unique identifier of the bot to remove from the zone.
      A negative value indicates an invalid or non-existent bot GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a bot from a specific zone
    code: 'BotPopulationManager* manager = BotPopulationManager::Instance();

      manager->RemoveBotFromZone(1234, 56789); // Removes bot with GUID 56789 from
      zone 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove multiple bots from a zone using loop
    code: "BotPopulationManager* manager = BotPopulationManager::Instance();\nstd::vector<int>\
      \ botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (int guid : botGuids) {\n    manager->RemoveBotFromZone(5678,\
      \ guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state and should only be called from within
    the context of the bot management system. It is assumed that the zoneId and botGuid
    are valid before calling this function. The method does not trigger any event
    notifications or cleanup routines beyond removing the bot from the zone's tracking
    list.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid zoneId or botGuid may lead to undefined
    behavior or inconsistencies in the bot population data structures. Ensure that
    all parameters are validated prior to invocation.
