  class: InterruptManager
  method: IsWithinInterruptWindow
  signature: bool InterruptManager::IsWithinInterruptWindow(const InterruptTarget
    & target, float executionTime)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target is within the interrupt window for spell interruption.
  description: The IsWithinInterruptWindow method evaluates if a given target is currently
    within the time frame during which a spell can be interrupted. This functionality
    is crucial for determining valid interrupt opportunities in combat mechanics,
    particularly when dealing with abilities that have specific timing windows for
    interruption. The method considers both the execution time of the spell and the
    target's current state to make this determination.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The InterruptTarget object representing the entity to check for interrupt
      eligibility. This typically contains information about the target's current
      spell casting state, duration, and other relevant properties.
  - name: executionTime
    description: A float value representing the time in seconds when the interrupt
      attempt occurs. This is used to calculate whether the target's spell is still
      within its interruptible window based on the current execution context.
  returns: Returns true if the target is currently within the interrupt window, allowing
    for a successful interruption; otherwise returns false if the target is outside
    the valid time frame or if the conditions for interruption are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check interrupt eligibility
    code: "if (interruptManager.IsWithinInterruptWindow(target, currentTime)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with interrupt logic\n    target.InterruptSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a combat handler to validate interrupt timing
    code: "void CombatHandler::ProcessInterrupt(const InterruptTarget& target) {\n\
      \    float currentExecutionTime = GetGameTime();\n    if (interruptManager.IsWithinInterruptWindow(target,\
      \ currentExecutionTime)) {\n        // Perform the actual spell interruption\n\
      \        target.InterruptSpell();\n        SendInterruptMessage(target);\n \
      \   } else {\n        // Notify player that interrupt failed due to timing\n\
      \        SendInvalidInterruptMessage(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate time tracking and proper state management
    of the target's spell casting. Developers should ensure that executionTime is
    synchronized with the game's internal clock to maintain consistent behavior across
    different server environments.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of executionTime can lead to inconsistent interrupt
    behavior, potentially causing spells to be interrupted at inappropriate times
    or not interrupted when they should be. Always validate that target states are
    properly initialized before calling this method.
