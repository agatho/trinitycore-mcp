  class: GridUpdater
  method: GridUpdater
  signature: void GridUpdater::GridUpdater(int & grid, int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the grid position and time difference for a given grid.
  description: The GridUpdater method is responsible for updating internal grid state
    information based on the provided grid coordinates and time difference. This method
    likely handles grid-related calculations or state transitions within the TrinityCore
    world management system. It operates on a grid coordinate system that represents
    the game world's spatial partitioning, where each grid cell corresponds to a specific
    area of the world. The method takes an integer reference for the grid identifier
    and a time difference value, suggesting it may be used in conjunction with time-based
    updates or movement calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: grid
    description: Reference to an integer representing the grid identifier that needs
      to be updated. This typically corresponds to a specific grid cell in the world's
      spatial partitioning system.
  - name: diff
    description: Integer value representing the time difference (in milliseconds or
      game time units) used for updating the grid state. This parameter likely affects
      how grid-related operations are processed based on elapsed time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Grid Update
    code: 'int currentGrid = 5;

      int deltaTime = 100;

      GridUpdater updater;

      updater.GridUpdater(currentGrid, deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Grids
    code: "std::vector<int> grids = {1, 2, 3, 4};\nint timeDiff = 50;\nfor (int& grid\
      \ : grids) {\n    updater.GridUpdater(grid, timeDiff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method appears to be part of a larger grid management system in TrinityCore.
    The 'grid' parameter is passed by reference, indicating that the method may modify
    the original grid value during execution. The implementation likely involves internal
    state tracking and could be called frequently during world updates or player movement
    events.
  warnings: Since this method modifies the grid reference parameter, developers should
    ensure that the grid value is properly initialized before calling this method.
    Additionally, incorrect time difference values might lead to unexpected behavior
    in grid-related operations.
