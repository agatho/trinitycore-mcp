  class: PhasingHandler
  method: ResetPhaseShift
  signature: void PhasingHandler::ResetPhaseShift(WorldObject * object)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the phase shift state for the specified WorldObject, removing any
    active phase restrictions.
  description: The ResetPhaseShift method clears all phase-related restrictions and
    resets the phase shift state for a given WorldObject. This operation typically
    occurs when an object needs to re-evaluate its visibility and interaction states
    within the game world, particularly after certain events such as zone changes,
    player login, or specific spell effects. The method ensures that the object's
    phasing is properly synchronized with the current world state, allowing it to
    become visible or hidden based on standard phase rules rather than custom restrictions.
    This function is crucial for maintaining proper game mechanics related to visibility,
    quest progression, and environmental interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject whose phase shift state will be reset.
      Must not be null. The object should be a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player
      instance.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Phase Shift for a Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      PhasingHandler::ResetPhaseShift(player);

      // The player''s phase restrictions are now cleared and will be re-evaluated
      based on standard rules.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting Phase Shift for a Game Object
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      PhasingHandler::ResetPhaseShift(go);

      // The game object''s phase restrictions are cleared, allowing it to be properly
      phased according to world conditions.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core engine during state
    transitions or when phasing rules need to be refreshed. It may trigger updates
    to the object's visibility and interaction state across the network, so it should
    not be called excessively in performance-critical sections. The method assumes
    that the provided WorldObject pointer is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer will result in undefined behavior
    or crash. Ensure that all objects passed to this function are valid and alive
    before calling. Incorrect usage may lead to visual glitches, quest state corruption,
    or unexpected visibility issues in the game world.
