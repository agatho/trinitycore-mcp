documentation:
  brief: Clears all waypoints from the movement path.
  description: The Clear method removes all waypoints from the MovementPath object,
    effectively resetting it to an empty state. This operation is typically used when
    a creature or game object needs to have its movement pattern redefined or when
    cleaning up resources associated with a path. The method ensures that any previously
    stored waypoints are discarded and the path becomes ready for new waypoint data.
    No parameters are required as the operation acts on the current instance of the
    MovementPath object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing a MovementPath before setting new waypoints
    code: 'MovementPath* path = new MovementPath();

      // Add some waypoints to the path...

      path->Clear(); // Reset the path

      // Now add new waypoints...'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI behavior scripting and movement system
    implementations within TrinityCore. It's important to note that clearing a path
    does not free the MovementPath object itself, but rather resets its internal waypoint
    storage. The method is designed to be efficient and safe for use during runtime.
