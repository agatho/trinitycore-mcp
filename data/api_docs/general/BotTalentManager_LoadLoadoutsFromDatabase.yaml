documentation:
  brief: Loads all bot talent loadouts from the database into memory for use.
  description: 'The LoadLoadoutsFromDatabase method retrieves all saved talent loadouts
    for bot characters from the TrinityCore database and initializes them in memory.
    This method is typically called during server startup or when a bot manager needs
    to refresh its internal talent data. It iterates through the database entries,
    constructs loadout objects, and associates them with respective bot instances.
    The method ensures that all previously saved talent configurations are available
    for bot character management without requiring manual reconfiguration. Precondition:
    Database connection must be established and valid. Postcondition: All loadouts
    are loaded into the manager''s internal data structures.'

  notes: This method performs database queries and should be called during initialization
    phases to avoid performance impact during active gameplay. The method assumes
    that the database schema for bot talents is properly set up with required tables
    and columns.
