documentation:
  brief: Handles a bot spawn failure by processing the request and reason codes
  description: The HandleSpawnFailure method is responsible for managing cases where
    a bot fails to spawn within the TrinityCore environment. It takes two integer
    parameters representing the failed spawn request identifier and the reason code
    for the failure. This method likely updates internal tracking structures, logs
    the failure event, and may trigger cleanup operations or retry mechanisms depending
    on the failure reason. The method is part of the BotSpawnOrchestrator class which
    manages bot spawning workflows in World of Warcraft server environments.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: The identifier of the spawn request that failed. This typically corresponds
      to a unique request ID or index used to track the specific bot spawning operation.
  - name: reason
    description: The reason code indicating why the spawn failed. This is usually
      an integer constant or enum value representing different failure scenarios such
      as resource constraints, invalid location, or server overload.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;

      orchestrator.HandleSpawnFailure(12345, 2); // Request ID 12345 failed due to
      reason code 2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Error Handling
    code: "void OnBotSpawnFailed(int requestId, int failureReason) {\n    if (requestId\
      \ > 0 && failureReason >= 0) {\n        BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;\n\
      \        orchestrator.HandleSpawnFailure(requestId, failureReason);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from within the bot spawning subsystem when
    a spawn operation does not complete successfully. It may update internal state
    tracking, decrement counters, or trigger event notifications to other systems.
    The exact behavior depends on the implementation details of the BotSpawnOrchestrator
    class and how it handles different failure scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are validated before calling this method as
    invalid values could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect internal state management.
    The method should not be called with negative request IDs or unhandled reason
    codes without proper error handling.
