documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes creature text locale data from the database into memory
    for use in World of Warcraft creature dialogue systems.
  description: The LoadCreatureTextLocales method is responsible for loading all creature
    text locale entries from the database into the in-memory storage system managed
    by the CreatureTextMgr. This method ensures that localized text messages for creatures
    are available for use when NPCs speak or emote during gameplay. It typically runs
    during server startup or reload operations to populate the internal data structures
    with translation data. The method handles multiple locales and prepares the text
    data for efficient retrieval during creature interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeCreatureTextManager()\n{\n    sCreatureTextMgr->LoadCreatureTextLocales();\n\
      \    // Creature text locales are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload
    operations. It should only be called once per server session after the database
    connection is established. The method internally handles thread safety for data
    access once loaded, but the loading itself should not occur concurrently with
    other database operations.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that the database connection is properly
    initialized before calling this method.
