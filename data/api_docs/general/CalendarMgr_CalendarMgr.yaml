documentation:
  brief: Moves a CalendarMgr object to another CalendarMgr instance, transferring
    ownership of its resources.
  description: This method is a move constructor for the CalendarMgr class. It transfers
    the internal state and resources from the source CalendarMgr object (passed as
    an rvalue reference) to the current object. This operation is typically used in
    scenarios where you want to efficiently transfer ownership of calendar-related
    data structures without performing expensive deep copies. The source object becomes
    invalid after this operation and should not be used. This method is part of the
    standard C++ move semantics implementation for the CalendarMgr class, which manages
    in-game calendar events and invitations within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a CalendarMgr
    code: 'CalendarMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with calendar data ...

      CalendarMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Move constructor invoked

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor is automatically generated by the compiler when no
    user-defined move constructor exists. It's important to understand that after
    moving, the source object should not be accessed or used as it may contain invalid
    data. The CalendarMgr class likely manages complex internal structures such as
    event lists, invitations, and time-related data that benefit from efficient move
    semantics.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after calling this constructor results in
    undefined behavior. Ensure all references to the source object are invalidated
    immediately after the move operation. This is especially important in multi-threaded
    contexts where other threads might access the source object concurrently.
