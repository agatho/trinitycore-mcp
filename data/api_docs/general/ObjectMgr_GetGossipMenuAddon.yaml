documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the gossip menu addon data for a specified menu ID.
  description: The GetGossipMenuAddon method fetches the GossipMenuAddon structure
    associated with a given menu identifier. This structure typically contains additional
    metadata or configuration options for a gossip menu, such as conditions, scripts,
    or custom display properties that extend the basic gossip functionality in World
    of Warcraft. The method is used primarily when processing or displaying gossip
    options to ensure that any extended behavior or requirements are properly applied.
    It performs a lookup in an internal data structure managed by the ObjectMgr class
    and returns a pointer to the corresponding GossipMenuAddon entry if found, or
    nullptr if no such menu exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const GossipMenuAddon object if a matching menu ID is found;
    otherwise, returns nullptr. The returned pointer should not be modified as it
    points to read-only data managed by the ObjectMgr.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Gossip Menu Addon
    code: "const GossipMenuAddon* addon = sObjectMgr->GetGossipMenuAddon(12345);\n\
      if (addon != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the addon data\n    // e.g., check\
      \ conditions, apply scripts\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from pre-loaded data structures.
    It relies on internal caching and lookup tables that are populated during server
    startup or when loading gossip menu data from the database.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value means all fields within the
    GossipMenuAddon are valid; some fields may be zero or empty depending on how the
    addon was defined in the database. Always validate the returned structure before
    accessing its members.
