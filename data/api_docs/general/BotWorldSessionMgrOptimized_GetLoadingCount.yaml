  signature: uint32 BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::GetLoadingCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current number of player sessions being loaded in the bot world
    session manager.
  description: The GetLoadingCount method retrieves the count of player sessions that
    are currently in the process of being loaded within the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
    class. This value represents the number of active loading operations for player
    characters, which is useful for monitoring system resource usage and load balancing
    in bot-based World of Warcraft environments. The method is typically used to track
    progress or determine when all sessions have finished loading. It provides a thread-safe
    read operation on an internal counter that is updated during session initialization
    processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of player sessions currently in
    the loading state. This count increases as new sessions begin loading and decreases
    as they complete loading.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Loading Progress
    code: "uint32 loadingCount = botWorldSessionMgr.GetLoadingCount();\nif (loadingCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Still loading %u player sessions...\", loadingCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an atomic counter, making
    it safe for concurrent access. The returned value should be interpreted as a snapshot
    at the time of calling and may change immediately after the call completes.
