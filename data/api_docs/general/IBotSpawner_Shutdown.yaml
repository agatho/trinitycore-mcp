documentation:
  brief: Stops and cleans up all active bot spawning operations within the system
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing bot spawning processes and
    performs necessary cleanup operations to ensure proper resource deallocation.
    This method is typically called during server shutdown or when disabling bot functionality
    to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability. The method ensures that
    all spawned bots are properly removed from the game world and their associated
    resources are freed. It may also handle cleanup of internal data structures and
    state management related to bot spawning.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'IBotSpawner* spawner = GetBotSpawner();

      spawner->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no bot operations are actively in
    progress to avoid undefined behavior. The shutdown process may take some time
    depending on the number of active bots and spawned entities.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while bots are actively spawning or in use may result
    in incomplete cleanup or resource leaks. Always ensure all bot operations are
    completed before invoking this method.
