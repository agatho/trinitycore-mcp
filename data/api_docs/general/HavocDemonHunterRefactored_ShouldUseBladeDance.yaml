  method: ShouldUseBladeDance
  signature: bool HavocDemonHunterRefactored::ShouldUseBladeDance(int * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Havoc Demon Hunter should use Blade Dance ability
    based on current combat state and resource management.
  description: This method evaluates the optimal timing for using the Blade Dance
    ability in the Havoc Demon Hunter's rotation. It considers factors such as available
    energy, current target health, and strategic positioning to determine if using
    Blade Dance would be beneficial. The method is typically called during AI decision-making
    processes to guide spell selection and resource allocation. It does not directly
    execute the ability but provides a boolean recommendation based on combat conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Blade Dance should be used according to current combat
    state and resource management logic; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->ShouldUseBladeDance()) {\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ BLADE_DANCE_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Rotation Logic
    code: "class HavocDemonHunterAI : public ScriptedAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (ShouldUseBladeDance()) {\n            DoCastVictim(BLADE_DANCE_SPELL_ID);\n\
      \        }\n        // Other AI logic...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal state tracking of the Demon Hunter's energy
    resources and target conditions. It may be influenced by cooldowns, buff/debuff
    states, and encounter-specific mechanics. This method is part of a larger AI decision
    framework and should not be used in isolation without proper context.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player character is actively
    engaged in combat. Using Blade Dance outside of combat or in inappropriate situations
    may result in suboptimal performance or unexpected behavior. The return value
    is based on current game state and may change rapidly during dynamic encounters.
