  signature: void LFGMgr::SetGroup(int guid, int group)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a player to a specific LFG group by GUID and group ID
  description: The SetGroup method in LFGMgr is used to associate a player with a
    specific Looking For Group (LFG) group. This method takes a player's unique identifier
    (GUID) and assigns them to a designated group within the LFG system. The assignment
    is typically used during group creation, joining, or reassignment processes within
    the LFG framework. It directly modifies internal LFG data structures to reflect
    the new group membership, ensuring that the player's LFG status is properly synchronized
    with the group they are assigned to.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be assigned to a group.
      This should be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore system.
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier to which the player will be assigned. This represents
      the LFG group ID that the player should join or be reassigned to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Assignment
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->SetGroup(12345, 67890);
    language: cpp
  - title: Assign Player to LFG Group During Join Process
    code: "void HandlePlayerJoinLFG(Player* player, uint32 groupId) {\n    LFGMgr::instance()->SetGroup(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal LFG group membership data structures.
    It should only be called after verifying that both the player GUID and group ID
    are valid. The method does not perform any validation on the input parameters,
    so callers must ensure validity before invocation.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid GUID or group IDs may result in undefined
    behavior or corruption of LFG data structures. Always validate inputs before calling
    SetGroup to prevent system instability.
