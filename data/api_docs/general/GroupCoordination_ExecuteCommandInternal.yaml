documentation:
  brief: Executes a coordination command within the group coordination system
  description: The ExecuteCommandInternal method processes and applies a given coordination
    command to the current group context. This internal method handles the core logic
    for executing various group-based actions such as movement coordination, object
    synchronization, or state updates. It operates within the TrinityCore's group
    management framework and is typically invoked by higher-level coordination services
    or command handlers. The method does not return any value but may modify internal
    group state or trigger subsequent actions based on the command type.
  parameters:
  - name: command
    description: The coordination command data structure containing the command type,
      parameters, and associated metadata to be executed within the group context
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Execution
    code: 'CoordinationCommandData cmd;

      cmd.type = CoordinationCommandType::MOVE_TO_POSITION;

      cmd.position = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      GroupCoordination coordination;

      coordination.ExecuteCommandInternal(cmd);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called internally by the group coordination
    system and should not typically be invoked directly from external modules. It
    assumes that proper group context and command validation have already been performed
    before execution.
