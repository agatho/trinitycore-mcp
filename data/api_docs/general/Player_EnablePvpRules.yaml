  brief: Enables PvP rules for the player, allowing combat with other players in designated
    areas.
  description: This method activates the Player versus Player (PvP) rules for a player,
    enabling them to engage in combat with other players in designated PvP zones.
    When called, it sets the player's PvP flag status and allows for PvP combat mechanics
    to be active. The method typically affects the player's ability to enter PvP zones
    or engage in PvP combat based on game rules and conditions. It is commonly used
    during player initialization or when entering specific PvP areas.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->EnablePvpRules(true);

      // Player now has PvP rules enabled'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include setting the player's PvP flag status and potentially
    modifying game state flags. Performance considerations are minimal as this is
    a simple method call. Thread safety is not an issue since it operates on a single
    player instance.
  warnings: This method should only be called when appropriate for the player's current
    game state and zone conditions. Improper usage may result in unexpected behavior
    or denial of PvP combat rules.
