    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Processes spell cast objectives for a player during quest completion.
  description: The HandleSpellCastObjective method is responsible for managing and
    validating spell casting requirements within a quest objective. It ensures that
    the specified spell has been cast by the player, updating quest progress accordingly.
    This method typically operates as part of the broader quest completion system
    in TrinityCore, where it checks if a player has met the necessary conditions to
    advance or complete a quest that requires spell casting. The method interacts
    with the player's quest log and objective tracking systems to update state and
    potentially reward quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character performing
      the quest completion action. This player must be actively engaged in the quest
      with the specified objective.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing details about
      the spell cast objective, including spell ID, required count, and other relevant
      metadata for validation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Cast Objective Handling
    code: "void example() {\n    Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\n \
      \   QuestObjectiveData objective;\n    objective.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_SPELL_CAST;\n\
      \    objective.spellId = 12345;\n    objective.count = 1;\n    QuestCompletion\
      \ completion;\n    completion.HandleSpellCastObjective(player, objective);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player is already in a valid state for quest
    progression and that the objective data has been properly initialized. It may
    trigger internal quest update events and could modify the player's quest log or
    progress tracking.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as it will likely crash if passed an invalid reference. Also, verify
    that the QuestObjectiveData contains correct spell IDs and counts to prevent unexpected
    behavior.
