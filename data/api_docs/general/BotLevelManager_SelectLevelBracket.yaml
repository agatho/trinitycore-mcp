  signature: const LevelBracket * BotLevelManager::SelectLevelBracket(int faction)
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the appropriate level bracket based on the player's faction
    for bot level management.
  description: The SelectLevelBracket method determines the correct level bracket
    for a bot based on the player's faction. This method is typically used within
    the BotLevelManager class to ensure that bots are assigned appropriate levels
    according to their faction's rules and guidelines. The selection process considers
    faction-specific level ranges and constraints to maintain game balance and realism.
    It returns a pointer to a constant LevelBracket structure which contains information
    about the minimum and maximum levels, as well as other relevant parameters for
    the selected bracket.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const LevelBracket structure representing the selected level
    bracket for the specified faction. Returns nullptr if no valid bracket can be
    determined for the given faction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotLevelManager botMgr;\nconst LevelBracket* bracket = botMgr.SelectLevelBracket(0);\n\
      if (bracket != nullptr) {\n    std::cout << \"Selected bracket min level: \"\
      \ << bracket->minLevel << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches or stores previously selected brackets for performance
    reasons. The LevelBracket structure probably contains fields such as minLevel,
    maxLevel, and factionId. This method may be called frequently during bot initialization
    or level adjustment processes.
  warnings: Ensure that the faction parameter passed to this method is valid (typically
    0 for alliance, 1 for horde) to avoid undefined behavior. The returned pointer
    should always be checked for null before use to prevent segmentation faults.
