  class: PathOptimizer
  method: EnableLineOfSightChecks
  signature: void PathOptimizer::EnableLineOfSightChecks(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables line-of-sight checks for path optimization.
  description: The EnableLineOfSightChecks method controls whether the PathOptimizer
    performs line-of-sight validation when computing paths. When enabled, the optimizer
    ensures that generated paths do not intersect with solid obstacles, making them
    more accurate for gameplay purposes. This feature is particularly important for
    NPC movement and AI behavior in World of Warcraft environments where characters
    must navigate around walls, buildings, and other environmental blockers. The method
    takes a boolean parameter to set the desired state for line-of-sight checks.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      line-of-sight checks in the path optimizer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Line-of-Sight Checks
    code: 'PathOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.EnableLineOfSightChecks(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Line-of-Sight Checks for Performance
    code: 'PathOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.EnableLineOfSightChecks(false); // Useful in performance-critical
      scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: Enabling line-of-sight checks may increase CPU usage due to additional collision
    detection calculations. This method affects all subsequent path computations made
    by the PathOptimizer instance.
