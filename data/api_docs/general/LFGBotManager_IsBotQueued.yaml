documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific bot is currently queued in the LFG system
  description: The IsBotQueued method determines if a bot identified by its GUID is
    currently present in the Looking for Group (LFG) queue. This functionality is
    essential for managing bot participation in group activities such as dungeons,
    raids, or battlegrounds. The method performs a lookup within the internal tracking
    structures of the LFGBotManager to verify the bot's queued status. It returns
    true if the bot is found in the queue and false otherwise. This check is commonly
    used before attempting to modify or remove a bot from the LFG system to ensure
    proper state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot (identified by botGuid) is currently
    queued in the LFG system, false if it is not found in the queue or if the bot
    GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (LFGBotManager::instance()->IsBotQueued(12345)) {\n    // Bot with GUID\
      \ 12345 is currently queued\n    printf(\"Bot is in LFG queue\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Bot is not queued\n    printf(\"Bot is not in LFG queue\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the LFGBotManager instance has been properly initialized
    and that bot GUIDs are valid. The implementation likely uses a hash map or similar
    data structure for O(1) lookup performance. Thread safety depends on the internal
    locking mechanism of the LFGBotManager class, which should be considered when
    calling this method from multiple threads.
