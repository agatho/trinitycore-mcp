  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: GetSecondaryRole
  signature: BotRole AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetSecondaryRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the secondary role assigned to a bot within the adaptive behavior
    manager system.
  description: The GetSecondaryRole method returns the BotRole enum value representing
    the secondary role of a bot. This role is typically used in conjunction with the
    primary role to determine how the bot should behave during gameplay, such as in
    group settings or specific encounter scenarios. The method does not modify any
    internal state and is read-only. It's commonly called during behavior decision-making
    processes where the bot's dual role assignment affects its actions and priorities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotRole enum value indicating the secondary role assigned to the bot.
    Possible values may include roles such as TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE_DEALER, or SPECIALIST
    depending on the implementation and context of the adaptive behavior system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotRole secondaryRole = behaviorManager.GetSecondaryRole();\nif (secondaryRole\
      \ == BotRole::DAMAGE_DEALER)\n{\n    // Perform damage dealer specific actions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI decision-making loops,
    so performance should be considered when used in tight loops. The returned role
    value is determined by the adaptive behavior manager's internal logic and may
    change based on group composition or encounter state.
