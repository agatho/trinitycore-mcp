  class: PositionManager
  method: IsWalkablePosition
  signature: bool PositionManager::IsWalkablePosition(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is walkable for units in the game world.
  description: The IsWalkablePosition method determines whether a specified position
    in the game world is navigable for mobile units such as players and NPCs. It evaluates
    the terrain, obstacles, and other environmental factors to assess if movement
    is possible at that location. This function is commonly used by pathfinding algorithms,
    AI behavior systems, and movement validation logic within TrinityCore's core mechanics.
    The method performs collision detection and height validation against the world's
    navigation mesh or terrain data to ensure accurate results.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the game
      world. This typically corresponds to a unique coordinate or node within the
      navigation system, often used as a lookup key for pathfinding operations.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is walkable and accessible for units;
    returns false if the position is blocked, unreachable, or invalid for movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Pathfinding
    code: "if (positionManager.IsWalkablePosition(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with movement\
      \ to position 12345\n    player->MoveToPosition(12345);\n} else {\n    // Find\
      \ an alternative path\n    player->FindAlternativePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "class EnemyAI {\npublic:\n    void Update() {\n        if (positionManager.IsWalkablePosition(targetPosition))\
      \ {\n            MoveTowards(targetPosition);\n        } else {\n          \
      \  // Avoid the position and re-evaluate\n            FindNewTarget();\n   \
      \     }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh or terrain data being
    properly initialized. Performance may vary depending on how complex the world
    geometry is at the specified position. The integer parameter 'pos' should typically
    be a valid node or coordinate identifier from the game's internal positioning
    system.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of invalid position identifiers can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the position value corresponds to an actual navigable
    point in the world before calling this method. This function does not validate
    whether the position is within bounds of the current map.
