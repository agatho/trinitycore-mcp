  signature: int MailReceiver::GetPlayerGUIDLow() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the low 32-bit portion of the player's GUID associated with this
    mail receiver.
  description: The GetPlayerGUIDLow method returns the lower 32 bits of the unique
    identifier (GUID) assigned to the player who is the recipient of a mail message.
    In TrinityCore, GUIDs are typically 64-bit values, but this method specifically
    extracts and returns only the lower portion. This is commonly used when working
    with database identifiers or when interfacing with systems that require the low
    portion of the GUID for indexing or comparison purposes. The method does not perform
    any validation on the player's existence or online status; it simply returns the
    stored low GUID value from the mail receiver object.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the lower 32 bits of the player's GUID. This value
    uniquely identifies the player within the context of the database and game world,
    but only in the lower portion of the full 64-bit GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Player GUID Low for Mail Processing
    code: 'MailReceiver receiver;

      // Assume receiver is properly initialized with a valid player

      uint32 playerLowGuid = receiver.GetPlayerGUIDLow();

      printf("Player GUID low: %u\n", playerLowGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in mail system operations where only the lower
    portion of a GUID is needed for database lookups or internal processing. The returned
    value should not be used directly as a full GUID without proper handling of the
    upper bits.
