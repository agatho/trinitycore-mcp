documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BehaviorCluster instance with default settings and empty
    internal state.
  description: The BehaviorCluster constructor initializes a new behavior cluster
    object, setting up its internal data structures and default configuration. This
    method prepares the cluster for use in AI-driven NPC behavior management within
    the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that all member variables are properly initialized
    to their default values, and any required internal state is established. The constructor
    does not accept any parameters, making it a simple default constructor. This initialization
    is crucial for ensuring that subsequent operations on the BehaviorCluster object
    behave predictably and safely.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BehaviorCluster instance
    code: 'BehaviorCluster cluster;

      // The cluster is now initialized with default settings

      // Ready to be used in AI behavior management'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs minimal initialization. Additional configuration
    may be required before the cluster can be effectively used in gameplay scenarios.
    The object should not be used until properly configured through other methods.
