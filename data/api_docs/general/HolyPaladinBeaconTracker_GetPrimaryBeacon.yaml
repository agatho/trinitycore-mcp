  method: GetPrimaryBeacon
  signature: int HolyPaladinBeaconTracker::GetPrimaryBeacon() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUID of the primary beacon target for a Holy Paladin.
  description: The GetPrimaryBeacon method returns the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the current primary beacon target assigned to the Holy Paladin. This is used in
    conjunction with the Beacon of Light ability, which allows paladins to share healing
    with nearby allies. The returned GUID corresponds to the unit that is currently
    marked as the primary beacon target, typically the player or a friendly unit that
    has been designated by the paladin's Beacon of Light spell. This method does not
    validate whether the target is still valid or within range; it simply returns
    the stored GUID value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the primary beacon target, or 0 if
    no primary beacon has been set. The GUID uniquely identifies the target unit in
    the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check primary beacon target
    code: "int primaryBeaconGUID = paladinBeaconTracker->GetPrimaryBeacon();\nif (primaryBeaconGUID\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // A primary beacon is set\n    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*player,\
      \ primaryBeaconGUID);\n    if (target && target->IsAlive())\n    {\n       \
      \ // Beacon target is alive and valid\n        // Perform actions with the beacon\
      \ target\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only returns the stored GUID of the primary beacon. It does not
    perform any validation or checks on whether the target is still valid, alive,
    or within range. Developers should always validate the returned GUID before using
    it to access the actual unit object.
  warnings: The returned GUID may be invalid if the target has been destroyed, logged
    out, or otherwise removed from the game world. Always verify that the target exists
    and is valid before attempting to use it in gameplay logic.
