  signature: bool ThreatIntegrationExample::IsHealer(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified player is classified as a healer class.
  description: The IsHealer method evaluates the player's class to determine if they
    belong to a healing specialization within the World of Warcraft game mechanics.
    This function checks against predefined healer classes such as Priest, Druid,
    Shaman, and Paladin, which are traditionally associated with healing abilities
    in the game. The method is commonly used in threat management systems, AI behavior
    scripting, or role-based gameplay logic where distinguishing between damage dealers
    and support classes is necessary.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's class is one of the recognized healer classes
    (Priest, Druid, Shaman, Paladin), otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player is a healer
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nif (ThreatIntegrationExample::IsHealer(player))\
      \ {\n    // Handle healer-specific logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Player is a\
      \ healer.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle non-healer logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player is not a healer.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on class identification through the Player class's GetClass()
    function. It assumes that only specific classes are considered healers in the
    context of this implementation, and does not account for specialized roles or
    talents beyond base class definitions.
