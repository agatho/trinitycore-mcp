  class: SpellCastRequestItemData

  signature: void SpellCastRequestItemData::SpellCastRequestItemData(int packSlot,
    int slot, int castItem)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a SpellCastRequestItemData object with specified slot and item
    information.
  description: The SpellCastRequestItemData constructor initializes an object used
    to track spell casting requests involving items. This class is typically used
    in the context of spell casting mechanics where a player attempts to cast a spell
    using an item from their inventory. The constructor sets up internal state variables
    for pack slot, inventory slot, and the cast item identifier. It's part of TrinityCore's
    spell handling system and is crucial for maintaining proper item usage during
    spell casting operations.
  parameters:
  - name: packSlot
    description: The backpack slot index where the item is located. Valid values are
      typically between 0-119 for standard inventory slots.
  - name: slot
    description: The specific inventory slot number within the pack. This represents
      the position of the item in the player's inventory.
  - name: castItem
    description: Identifier for the item being used to cast the spell. This is typically
      the item's entry ID or GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Cast Request Initialization
    code: 'SpellCastRequestItemData request(5, 10, 12345);

      // Initializes a spell cast request for item with ID 12345

      // located at pack slot 5, inventory slot 10'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by TrinityCore's spell system
    when processing spell cast requests. Developers should be aware that the parameters
    represent physical inventory positions and may need validation before use in certain
    contexts.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values can lead to invalid item references during
    spell casting, potentially causing crashes or unexpected behavior. Always validate
    slot indices against player inventory bounds before calling this constructor.
