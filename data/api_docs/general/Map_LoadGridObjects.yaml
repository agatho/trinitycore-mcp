  class: Map
  method: LoadGridObjects
  signature: void Map::LoadGridObjects(int * grid, const int & cell)
documentation:
  brief: Loads game objects for a specified grid and cell within the map.
  description: The LoadGridObjects method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all game objects (such as creatures, items, and world entities) that exist within
    a specific grid and cell on the map. This method ensures that when a player or
    NPC enters a particular area, the necessary objects are present in memory for
    proper interaction. It typically operates during map initialization or when a
    new grid is accessed by an active player. The method uses internal grid coordinates
    to determine which objects should be loaded into memory.
  parameters:
  - name: grid
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the grid coordinates (typically
      x and y) where objects are to be loaded.
  - name: cell
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the specific cell within the grid
      that should be processed for object loading.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LoadGridObjects
    code: 'int gridCoords[2] = {50, 60};

      int cellCoord = 1;

      map->LoadGridObjects(gridCoords, cellCoord);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the map's internal object management system and is
    usually called automatically by the core engine when a player moves into a new
    grid area. It may involve database queries or cached data retrieval to populate
    the objects in memory.
