  brief: Initializes the guild reset time for the world.
  description: The InitGuildResetTime method sets up the initial timestamp for when
    guild data resets in the World of Warcraft server. This function is typically
    called during server initialization or at specific intervals to ensure that guild-related
    timers and cooldowns are properly synchronized. The reset time determines when
    guild permissions, member limits, and other guild-specific mechanics will be refreshed.
    This method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations.

  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup or periodic maintenance
    cycles to synchronize guild reset times across all realms. It's important for
    maintaining consistent guild behavior and preventing timing discrepancies in guild-related
    operations.
