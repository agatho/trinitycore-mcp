  method: GetEnemyTeamScore
  signature: uint32 BattlegroundAI::GetEnemyTeamScore(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the score of the enemy team in a battleground.
  description: The GetEnemyTeamScore method returns the current score of the opposing
    team within a battleground instance. This method is typically used by battleground
    AI systems to determine the relative progress or standing of the enemy team during
    gameplay. The returned value represents how many objectives or points the enemy
    team has accumulated. This information can be crucial for AI decision-making,
    such as determining when to initiate attacks or defend key positions. The method
    does not require any parameters and is designed to provide real-time score data
    for strategic purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer that may be used to store player-specific information,
      though this parameter appears unused in typical implementations.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the enemy team's score. This value
    typically corresponds to objectives captured or points earned by the opposing
    team during the battleground match.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground AI
    code: "uint32 enemyScore = bgAI->GetEnemyTeamScore(nullptr);\nif (enemyScore <\
      \ 100)\n{\n    // Enemy team is behind, initiate offensive strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Team Scores for Strategy
    code: "uint32 playerScore = bgAI->GetPlayerTeamScore();\nuint32 enemyScore = bgAI->GetEnemyTeamScore(nullptr);\n\
      if (playerScore > enemyScore)\n{\n    // Player team is leading, focus on defense\n\
      }\nelse if (enemyScore > playerScore)\n{\n    // Enemy team is leading, consider\
      \ counter-attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI framework and should only be called
    within a valid battleground context. The parameter 'player' is present in the
    signature but may not be actively used by the implementation. The returned score
    value is updated dynamically as objectives are captured or points are awarded
    during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when the battleground instance
    is active and properly initialized. Calling it outside of a valid battleground
    context may result in undefined behavior or incorrect values.
