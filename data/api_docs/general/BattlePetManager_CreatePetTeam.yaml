    & teamName, const int & petSpeciesIds)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new battle pet team for the specified player with the given team
    name and pet species IDs.
  description: The CreatePetTeam method is responsible for generating a new battle
    pet team within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a player identifier, a team
    name, and an array of pet species IDs to construct the team. This method is typically
    used in the context of World of Warcraft's Battle Pet system, where players can
    organize their pets into teams for various in-game activities such as pet battles.
    The method validates input parameters and ensures that the team is properly registered
    within the player's collection of battle pet teams. It returns a boolean value
    indicating whether the operation was successful or not.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter must point to a valid player GUID; otherwise, the method
      will fail.
  - name: teamName
    description: A string containing the name of the battle pet team. The name should
      be unique per player and cannot exceed the maximum allowed length for team names
      in the game.
  - name: petSpeciesIds
    description: An integer reference to an array or list of pet species IDs that
      will form the composition of the new team. These IDs correspond to specific
      battle pet types within the game's database.
  returns: Returns true if the battle pet team was successfully created and registered
    for the player; otherwise, returns false. Failure may occur due to invalid input
    parameters, duplicate team names, or insufficient resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nstd::string teamName = \"My Battle Team\";\nint\
      \ petSpeciesIds[] = { 123, 456, 789 };\nbool result = battlePetManager->CreatePetTeam(&playerId,\
      \ teamName, petSpeciesIds);\nif (result) {\n    std::cout << \"Battle pet team\
      \ created successfully.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Failed\
      \ to create battle pet team.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player exists and has sufficient permissions
    to create a new team. The implementation may involve database writes and synchronization
    with the client-side UI updates. It is recommended to validate all inputs before
    calling this method to prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the petSpeciesIds array contains valid and existing pet species
    IDs; otherwise, the method might fail silently or cause inconsistencies in the
    player's battle pet data. Also, avoid creating teams with duplicate names as it
    may lead to overwrites or errors.
