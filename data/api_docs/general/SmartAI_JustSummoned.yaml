  class: SmartAI
  method: JustSummoned
  signature: void SmartAI::JustSummoned(Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature is summoned by this AI's owner, allowing custom behavior
    execution.
  description: The JustSummoned method is a callback function in the SmartAI class
    that is invoked whenever a creature is successfully summoned by the AI's owner.
    This method provides an opportunity for custom logic to be executed immediately
    after a summoning event occurs. It is typically used to initialize summoned creatures,
    assign them specific behaviors, or trigger additional actions based on the summoned
    entity. The method receives a pointer to the summoned Creature object, which can
    then be manipulated or queried for properties. This callback is part of the SmartAI's
    event-driven system and is essential for implementing complex AI behaviors involving
    summoning mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that was summoned. This represents
      the summoned entity with full access to its properties and methods.
  returns: null

    code: "void SmartAI::JustSummoned(Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature)\n\
      \    {\n        creature->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n        creature->AI()->DoZoneInCombat();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Summoned Creature with Custom Behavior
    code: "void SmartAI::JustSummoned(Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature &&\
      \ creature->GetEntry() == 12345)\n    {\n        creature->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS,\
      \ UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n        creature->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, 2.0f);\n\
      \        creature->AI()->SetReactState(REACT_DEFENSIVE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from within the SmartAI framework's internal summoning
    logic. Developers should ensure that any operations performed on the summoned
    creature do not interfere with the AI's core functionality or cause race conditions.
    The creature pointer is guaranteed to be valid when this method is called, but
    it's good practice to verify it before using.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations in this method
    as it may affect AI responsiveness. Be cautious when modifying the summoned creature's
    state, as changes might conflict with other AI behaviors or summoning mechanics.
