  class: PositionManager
  method: PredictPosition
  signature: int PositionManager::PredictPosition(int * target, float timeAhead)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future position of a target object at a specified time in the
    future.
  description: The PredictPosition method calculates and returns the expected coordinates
    of a target object after a given time interval has elapsed. This functionality
    is commonly used in game mechanics for anticipating movement, such as predicting
    where an enemy will be before a spell or ability lands. The method takes into
    account the current position and velocity of the target to estimate its future
    location. It's particularly useful for AI behavior, spell targeting, and combat
    prediction systems within TrinityCore. The method assumes that the target object
    is moving in a predictable manner and does not account for sudden changes in direction
    or speed.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the current position of
      the target object. The array should contain at least three elements representing
      X, Y, and Z coordinates respectively.
  - name: timeAhead
    description: Float value indicating the time duration (in seconds) into the future
      for which to predict the position. Must be a positive value.
  returns: Returns an integer status code indicating success or failure of the prediction
    operation. A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while non-zero values
    may indicate errors such as invalid input parameters or calculation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Prediction
    code: "int targetPosition[3] = {100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f};\nfloat timeAhead = 2.5f;\n\
      int result = positionManager->PredictPosition(targetPosition, timeAhead);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Prediction successful\n    printf(\"Predicted position:\
      \ (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f)\\n\", targetPosition[0], targetPosition[1], targetPosition[2]);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using PredictPosition for Spell Targeting
    code: "float playerPos[3] = {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f};\nfloat enemyPos[3] = {100.0f,\
      \ 150.0f, 0.0f};\nfloat timeToImpact = 3.0f;\nint result = positionManager->PredictPosition(enemyPos,\
      \ timeToImpact);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Use predicted enemy position for\
      \ spell targeting\n    // Calculate distance and cast spell at predicted location\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs basic linear prediction assuming constant velocity. It
    does not account for acceleration, deceleration, or complex movement patterns
    like curves or jumps. For more accurate predictions involving complex motion,
    additional physics calculations may be required. The target parameter is modified
    in-place to store the predicted coordinates.
  warnings: Ensure that the input target array contains valid coordinate data before
    calling this method. Passing null pointers or invalid time values may result in
    undefined behavior. The prediction accuracy decreases significantly for large
    time intervals due to potential changes in movement patterns.
