  method: AdjustBehaviorWeights
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::AdjustBehaviorWeights()
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts behavior weights for AI decision making based on current game state
    and context
  description: The AdjustBehaviorWeights method dynamically modifies the relative
    importance or probability of different AI behaviors within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
    This method is typically invoked during AI update cycles to adapt behavior selection
    based on environmental factors, player actions, or internal state changes. It
    recalculates weights for various behaviors to ensure that the most appropriate
    actions are selected according to current conditions. The adjustment process may
    consider factors such as threat level, distance to targets, available resources,
    and previous behavior outcomes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n  \
      \  m_adaptiveBehaviorManager->AdjustBehaviorWeights();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with behavior selection ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom AI logic. The weight adjustments
    are usually calculated using heuristics or machine learning models that evaluate
    current game state variables.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method outside of the AI update context as it may lead
    to inconsistent behavior or race conditions in multi-threaded environments. Ensure
    that any custom behavior weight calculations properly handle edge cases and maintain
    valid probability distributions.
