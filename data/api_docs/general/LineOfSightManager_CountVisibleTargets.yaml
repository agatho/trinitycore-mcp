documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of visible targets within the line of sight manager's scope
  description: The CountVisibleTargets method calculates and returns the total number
    of targets that are currently visible to the line of sight manager. This method
    is typically used in game AI systems to determine how many enemies or objects
    are within the field of view, which can influence decision-making processes such
    as targeting, threat assessment, or combat behavior. The method evaluates visibility
    based on factors like distance, obstruction checks, and field of view constraints.
    It does not modify any internal state but rather provides a read-only count of
    visible entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of targets currently visible
    to the line of sight manager. A return value of zero indicates no visible targets,
    while higher values indicate the count of visible entities in the manager's scope.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 visibleCount = lineOfSightManager.CountVisibleTargets();\nif (visibleCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process visible targets\n    printf(\"Found %u visible targets\\\
      n\", visibleCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Decision Making
    code: "uint32 visibleEnemies = lineOfSightManager.CountVisibleTargets();\nif (visibleEnemies\
      \ >= 3)\n{\n    // Switch to defensive stance\n    player->SetStance(STANCE_DEFENSIVE);\n\
      }\nelse if (visibleEnemies == 0)\n{\n    // Move to patrol mode\n    player->SetMovementState(MOVE_PATROL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs visibility checks using the underlying line of sight
    system, which may include collision detection with environment objects. The performance
    of this method can vary depending on the number of potential targets and the complexity
    of the environment. For optimal performance in high-frequency calls, consider
    caching results or limiting the frequency of visibility checks.
  warnings: The method assumes that all targets have been properly registered with
    the line of sight manager before calling. If targets are added or removed between
    calls, the returned count may not reflect the current state accurately. Additionally,
    this method does not account for temporary invisibility effects or stealth mechanics
    unless explicitly handled by the underlying visibility system.
