  method: ~BotProfiler
  signature: void BotProfiler::~BotProfiler()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotProfiler instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The BotProfiler destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of a BotProfiler object. This includes
    releasing any internal data structures, stopping profiling activities, and ensuring
    no memory leaks occur when the profiler is no longer needed. The destructor is
    automatically invoked when a BotProfiler instance goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this method ensures proper
    cleanup of profiling data for AI behavior analysis and performance monitoring.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotProfiler instance
    code: 'BotProfiler* profiler = new BotProfiler();

      // ... use profiler ...

      delete profiler; // Triggers ~BotProfiler()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    BotProfiler profiler;\n    // ... use profiler\
      \ ...\n    // ~BotProfiler() automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object goes
    out of scope or is deleted. It's important to ensure that all profiling data is
    properly flushed before destruction to avoid losing valuable performance metrics.
    The destructor should be fast and not block execution, as it may be called during
    critical game operations.
  warnings: Never manually call the destructor directly unless you're implementing
    custom memory management. Also, be cautious about calling delete on a pointer
    that has already been deleted, which could lead to undefined behavior.
