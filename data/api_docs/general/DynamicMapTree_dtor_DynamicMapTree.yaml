  class: DynamicMapTree
  method: ~DynamicMapTree
  signature: void DynamicMapTree::~DynamicMapTree()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the DynamicMapTree instance and releases all associated memory resources.
  description: The ~DynamicMapTree destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    allocated by the DynamicMapTree object. This includes releasing any internal data
    structures such as spatial partitioning trees used for efficient collision detection
    and line-of-sight calculations. The destructor ensures that no memory leaks occur
    when a DynamicMapTree instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In
    the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this class is typically used to
    manage dynamic obstacles and terrain features that affect movement and spell casting.
    The destruction process is critical for maintaining performance and preventing
    resource exhaustion in environments with many moving objects.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Destruction of DynamicMapTree
    code: 'DynamicMapTree* tree = new DynamicMapTree();

      // ... use the tree ...

      delete tree; // Triggers ~DynamicMapTree destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Cleanup in Container
    code: 'std::vector<DynamicMapTree*> trees;

      trees.push_back(new DynamicMapTree());

      // ... use trees ...

      trees.clear(); // Automatically calls ~DynamicMapTree for each element'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no other objects hold
    references to the tree during destruction, as this could lead to undefined behavior.
    The cleanup process may involve recursive deletion of internal nodes in the spatial
    data structure.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly unless you're implementing a custom
    memory management scheme. Always use proper object lifetime management (stack
    allocation, smart pointers, or explicit delete) to ensure safe destruction. Avoid
    using the tree after its destructor has been called.
