documentation:
  brief: Returns the base stat value for a specified stat index.
  description: The GetCreateStat method retrieves the initial or base stat value for
    a given stat index from the unit's creation data. This method is typically used
    to access the fundamental stat values that define a unit's starting attributes,
    such as health, mana, or other character statistics. The returned value represents
    the stat as it was defined at the time of the unit's creation, before any modifications
    from equipment, buffs, or other gameplay effects. This method is commonly utilized
    in character creation, stat calculation systems, and when determining base gameplay
    parameters for units.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the base stat value for the specified stat index.
    Returns 0.0 if the stat index is invalid or not defined.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Base Strength Value
    code: 'Unit* player = ...;

      float baseStrength = player->GetCreateStat(STAT_STRENGTH);

      // baseStrength now contains the unit''s initial strength value'
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate Stat Growth Over Time
    code: 'Unit* creature = ...;

      float baseAgility = creature->GetCreateStat(STAT_AGILITY);

      float currentAgility = creature->GetStat(STAT_AGILITY);

      float growth = currentAgility - baseAgility;

      // Calculate how much agility has increased since creation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the unit's creation-time stat data, which is distinct
    from runtime stat modifications. The stat indices are typically defined in the
    game's constants or enums (e.g., STAT_STRENGTH, STAT_AGILITY). This method should
    not be used for retrieving current stats after modifications; use GetStat() instead.
  warnings: Ensure that the stat index passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to a supported stat type. Passing an invalid index may result in undefined behavior
    or return unexpected values. This method does not account for temporary stat changes
    from buffs, debuffs, or equipment.
