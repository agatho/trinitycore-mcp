  signature: std::string PhasingHandler::FormatPhases(const PhaseShift & phaseShift)
documentation:
  brief: Formats and returns a string representation of the phase shift data for debugging
    or logging purposes
  description: The FormatPhases method converts the internal phase shift information
    into a human-readable string format. This utility function is primarily used for
    debugging and logging phase-related events in the TrinityCore server. It processes
    the PhaseShift structure which contains information about active phases, phase
    masks, and other phase-related data that determines what content a player can
    see in the game world. The method does not modify any state but provides a convenient
    way to inspect current phase settings without direct access to internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted phase information including active phases,
    phase masks, and related identifiers that represent the current phase shift state
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: "void DebugPhaseShift(Player* player)\n{\n    PhaseShift const& phaseShift\
      \ = player->GetPhaseShift();\n    std::string phaseInfo = PhasingHandler::FormatPhases(phaseShift);\n\
      \    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"phasing\", \"Current phase shift: %s\", phaseInfo.c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in debug builds or logging contexts. The returned
    string format may change between different TrinityCore versions. It's recommended
    to use this method only for debugging purposes as it may have performance implications
    when called frequently.
  warnings: The method assumes that the PhaseShift parameter contains valid data.
    Calling this method with an uninitialized or corrupted PhaseShift structure may
    produce unexpected output or undefined behavior.
