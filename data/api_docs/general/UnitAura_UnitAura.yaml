  method: UnitAura
  signature: void UnitAura::UnitAura(const AuraCreateInfo & createInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new aura instance with the specified creation information.
  description: The UnitAura constructor initializes a new aura object using the provided
    AuraCreateInfo structure. This method sets up all necessary internal state for
    the aura, including duration, stack count, caster information, and application
    effects. The aura is not immediately applied to a unit; instead, it prepares the
    data structure that can later be applied through appropriate methods like AddAura
    or ApplyAura. This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore
    framework when creating new aura instances from spell effects or other game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: createInfo
    description: A const reference to an AuraCreateInfo structure containing all necessary
      parameters for aura creation, including caster unit, spell info, duration, stack
      count, and effect application data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a basic aura instance
    code: 'AuraCreateInfo createInfo;

      createInfo.SetCaster(player);

      createInfo.SetSpellInfo(spellInfo);

      createInfo.SetDuration(30000); // 30 seconds

      UnitAura* aura = new UnitAura(createInfo);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not automatically apply the aura to any unit. It only
    initializes the internal state of the aura object. The actual application to a
    target unit requires calling methods like AddAura or ApplyAura on the target unit.
    This method is part of the internal aura management system and should typically
    be called through higher-level APIs rather than directly.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of UnitAura objects should generally be avoided in
    favor of using the framework's built-in aura creation mechanisms. Improper use
    of this constructor without proper setup can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Ensure that all required fields in AuraCreateInfo are properly initialized before
    passing it to this constructor.
