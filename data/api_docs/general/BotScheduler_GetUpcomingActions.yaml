api:
  class: BotScheduler
  method: GetUpcomingActions
  signature: int BotScheduler::GetUpcomingActions(uint32 minutes) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of upcoming bot actions scheduled within the specified
    time window.
  description: The GetUpcomingActions method calculates and returns the count of bot
    actions that are scheduled to occur within the next 'minutes' interval. This is
    typically used by the TrinityCore AI system to determine how many actions a bot
    has planned ahead, which can influence decision-making processes such as when
    to perform idle checks or reschedule tasks. The method does not modify any internal
    state but provides a snapshot of future activity for the bot's scheduler.
  parameters:
  - name: minutes
    description: The time window in minutes to look ahead for upcoming actions. Must
      be a positive integer value representing the number of minutes into the future
      to check.
  returns: An integer representing the total count of bot actions scheduled within
    the specified time window. Returns zero if no actions are found or if the input
    parameter is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int upcoming = botScheduler.GetUpcomingActions(30); // Checks for actions\
      \ in next 30 minutes\nif (upcoming > 0) {\n    // Bot has scheduled actions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining Action Load
    code: "uint32 timeWindow = 15;\nint actionCount = botScheduler.GetUpcomingActions(timeWindow);\n\
      if (actionCount >= 5) {\n    // Bot is busy, consider deferring new tasks\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal scheduling data structures and may not reflect
    real-time changes immediately. It's intended for use in decision-making logic
    rather than immediate action execution. Performance is generally efficient as
    it only counts scheduled events without executing them.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'minutes' parameter is a positive value; otherwise, the
    result may be undefined or misleading. This method should not be used to directly
    manipulate bot behavior but rather to inform strategic decisions based on upcoming
    workload.
