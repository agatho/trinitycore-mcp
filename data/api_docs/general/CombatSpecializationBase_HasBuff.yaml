documentation:
  brief: Checks if the combat specialization has a specific buff applied.
  description: The HasBuff method determines whether a specified spell buff is currently
    active on the combat specialization. This method is typically used in combat scenarios
    to verify the presence of beneficial effects such as buffs, auras, or special
    abilities that modify character performance. The check is performed against the
    internal state of the combat specialization and returns true if the buff is found,
    false otherwise. This functionality is essential for implementing conditional
    logic in combat behaviors, ability usage, and spell interactions within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell buff is currently active on the combat
    specialization; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Buff Check
    code: "if (combatSpec->HasBuff(12345)) {\n    // Perform action when buff is active\n\
      \    DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Usage
    code: "if (!combatSpec->HasBuff(SPELL_ID_BLESSING_OF_KINGS)) {\n    // Apply the\
      \ buff before casting the spell\n    caster->AddAura(SPELL_ID_BLESSING_OF_KINGS,\
      \ target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of active buffs and may not reflect
    real-time changes if the buff state is modified outside of standard spell application
    mechanisms. It's recommended to use this method in conjunction with other combat
    state checks for robust behavior validation.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to a valid aura or buff
    spell in the game database, as invalid IDs may lead to unexpected behavior or
    performance issues if not properly validated.
