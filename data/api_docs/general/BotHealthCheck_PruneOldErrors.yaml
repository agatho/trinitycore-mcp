documentation:
  brief: Removes expired error entries from the bot health check system based on current
    time
  description: The PruneOldErrors method cleans up stale error records stored within
    the BotHealthCheck class by removing entries that have exceeded their valid time
    window. This maintenance operation ensures that the health monitoring system only
    retains relevant error data for active bots, preventing accumulation of outdated
    information that could skew health metrics or consume unnecessary memory resources.
    The method iterates through internal error tracking structures and deletes entries
    where the recorded timestamp is older than the specified current time value, effectively
    performing garbage collection on expired error reports.

  - title: Basic Usage in Health Check Cycle
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n \
      \   botHealthCheck.PruneOldErrors(getCurrentTime());\n    // ... rest of AI\
      \ update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called periodically as part of the bot health
    monitoring cycle to maintain optimal performance. The pruning operation is designed
    to be lightweight and non-blocking, but frequent calls may impact performance
    during high-traffic periods with many active bots.
