documentation:
  brief: Requests bot movement using a provided movement request object
  description: The RequestMovement method is used by the BotAI class to process and
    initiate movement requests for AI-controlled bots. It takes a MovementRequest
    object as input which contains details about the desired movement behavior, such
    as destination coordinates, movement type, and associated flags. The method returns
    true if the movement request was successfully queued or processed, and false if
    it failed due to invalid parameters or system constraints. This method is typically
    called internally by the bot AI system when a movement action needs to be executed,
    and it integrates with TrinityCore's movement handling subsystem to ensure proper
    pathfinding and execution.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: A const reference to a MovementRequest object containing movement
      parameters including target position, movement type, speed, and flags. The request
      must be properly initialized with valid destination coordinates and appropriate
      movement settings.
  returns: Returns true if the movement request was successfully processed and queued
    for execution, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates invalid
    input parameters, failed pathfinding, or system resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Request
    code: "MovementRequest request;\nrequest.type = MOVE_NORMAL;\nrequest.targetX\
      \ = 1234.5f;\nrequest.targetY = 6789.0f;\nrequest.targetZ = 100.0f;\nbool success\
      \ = botAI->RequestMovement(request);\nif (success)\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"bot.ai\"\
      , \"Movement request queued successfully\");"
    language: cpp
  - title: Movement Request with Speed and Flags
    code: "MovementRequest request;\nrequest.type = MOVE_RUN;\nrequest.targetX = player->GetPositionX()\
      \ + 10.0f;\nrequest.targetY = player->GetPositionY();\nrequest.targetZ = player->GetPositionZ();\n\
      request.speed = 3.5f;\nrequest.flags = MOVEFLAG_WALK_MODE;\nbool success = botAI->RequestMovement(request);\n\
      if (!success)\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"bot.ai\", \"Failed to queue movement request\"\
      );"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI movement system and integrates with TrinityCore's
    pathfinding engine. It does not immediately execute movement but rather queues
    the request for processing by the bot's movement handler. The method assumes that
    the MovementRequest object has been properly validated before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized MovementRequest object
    may result in undefined behavior or failed movement attempts. Ensure all required
    fields are populated before invoking this method, particularly target coordinates
    and movement type.
