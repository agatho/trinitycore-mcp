    itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Azerite Empowered Item entry for a given item ID.
  description: The GetAzeriteEmpoweredItem method fetches the AzeriteEmpoweredItemEntry
    data structure associated with a specific item identifier. This method is used
    to access information about items that have been empowered with Azerite, a core
    gameplay mechanic in World of Warcraft that enhances gear with powerful abilities.
    The returned entry contains details such as the item's Azerite power IDs, levels,
    and other related properties. This function is typically called during item processing
    or when checking if an item has Azerite empowerment data. It performs a lookup
    in the internal DB2 database cache for Azerite empowered items.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the AzeriteEmpoweredItemEntry structure corresponding to the
    requested item ID, or nullptr if no such entry exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const AzeriteEmpoweredItemEntry* entry = sDB2Manager->GetAzeriteEmpoweredItem(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    // Process the Azerite empowered item data\n    printf(\"\
      Item %u has %u powers\\n\", entry->ItemId, entry->Powers.size());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 caching and assumes that the AzeriteEmpoweredItem.db2
    file has been properly loaded into memory. The returned pointer is valid only
    as long as the DB2Manager instance exists and the data hasn't been reloaded or
    cleared.
  warnings: The method returns nullptr for invalid item IDs, so always check for null
    before dereferencing the returned pointer to avoid segmentation faults.
