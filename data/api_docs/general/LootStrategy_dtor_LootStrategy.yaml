documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LootStrategy instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LootStrategy class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the lifetime
    of the LootStrategy object. This method is automatically invoked when a LootStrategy
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this typically involves releasing memory associated
    with loot distribution strategies, such as item lists, probability tables, or
    other internal data structures used for determining how loot should be distributed
    among players. The destructor ensures proper resource management and prevents
    memory leaks within the game's loot system.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of LootStrategy object
    code: 'LootStrategy* strategy = new LootStrategy();

      // ... use the strategy ...

      delete strategy; // This calls the destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via scope
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    LootStrategy strategy;\n    // ... use the strategy\
      \ ...\n} // Destructor automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a virtual function in the base class, allowing proper cleanup
    of derived classes. It's important to ensure that all derived classes also properly
    implement their own destructors if they manage additional resources. This destructor
    should not be called directly unless you are explicitly managing object lifetime.
