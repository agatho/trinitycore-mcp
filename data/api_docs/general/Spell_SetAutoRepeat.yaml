documentation:
  brief: Sets the auto-repeat status of a spell to enable or disable automatic casting.
  description: The Spell::SetAutoRepeat method controls whether a spell will automatically
    repeat its casting process. This is commonly used for spells that have an auto-repeat
    mechanism, such as ranged attacks or certain abilities. When set to true, the
    spell will continuously cast at regular intervals; when set to false, it will
    stop repeating. This method affects the behavior of the spell's auto-repeat functionality
    and is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods to manage
    spell execution and cooldowns.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = player->GetSpell(12345);

      spell->SetAutoRepeat(true);

      // This enables auto-repeat for the spell'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Spell* spell = player->GetSpell(12345);\nif (spell)\n{\n    spell->SetAutoRepeat(false);\n\
      \    // This disables auto-repeat for the spell\n}\n// This ensures that the\
      \ spell stops repeating after being set to false"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell management
    methods and should be called before or during spell initialization. The auto-repeat
    behavior may depend on the specific spell type and game mechanics, such as whether
    it's a ranged attack or an ability that supports auto-repeat.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell behavior or unintended
    auto-repeat functionality. Care must be taken when setting auto-repeat status
    for spells that are not meant to repeat, as it may cause performance issues or
    unexpected gameplay mechanics.
