  brief: Sets the timestamp for when a pet was named.
  description: This method sets the pet name timestamp for a unit, which is used to
    track when a pet was given its name. The timestamp is typically used in conjunction
    with pet naming mechanics to ensure proper synchronization of pet names and their
    associated data. This method is primarily used for managing pet naming behavior
    within the TrinityCore framework.

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pet-related methods
    to manage pet naming within the game mechanics. The timestamp value represents
    a Unix time stamp and should be set appropriately to reflect the correct time
    of naming.
