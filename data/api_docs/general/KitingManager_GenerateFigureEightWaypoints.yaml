  class: KitingManager
  method: GenerateFigureEightWaypoints
  signature: int KitingManager::GenerateFigureEightWaypoints(Unit * target, float
    radius)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a figure-eight pattern of waypoints around a target unit for kiting
    movement.
  description: The GenerateFigureEightWaypoints method creates a series of waypoints
    that form a figure-eight (infinity symbol) path around a specified target unit.
    This is commonly used in AI behavior to enable kiting mechanics, where an NPC
    or player moves in a circular pattern around a target while maintaining distance.
    The method calculates positions in a two-loop figure-eight trajectory based on
    the provided radius and target orientation. It returns the number of waypoints
    successfully generated, which can be used to determine if the operation was successful
    or to iterate through the resulting path.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the center point for the
      figure-eight pattern. This represents the entity around which the kiting movement
      will be performed.
  - name: radius
    description: Floating-point value representing the radius of the figure-eight
      pattern in yards. This determines how far the waypoints are from the target
      unit's position.
  returns: Integer value indicating the number of waypoints generated successfully.
    Returns 0 if no waypoints were created due to invalid input or calculation failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for kiting AI
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nfloat radius = 10.0f;\nint numWaypoints\
      \ = kitingManager->GenerateFigureEightWaypoints(target, radius);\nif (numWaypoints\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with movement using generated waypoints\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic target and radius
    code: "Unit* target = ai->GetTarget();\nfloat radius = target->GetObjectSize()\
      \ * 2.0f;\nint numWaypoints = kitingManager->GenerateFigureEightWaypoints(target,\
      \ radius);\nif (numWaypoints >= 4)\n{\n    // Use waypoints to perform kiting\
      \ movement\n    for (int i = 0; i < numWaypoints; ++i)\n    {\n        Position\
      \ pos = kitingManager->GetWaypoint(i);\n        // Move to position\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other kiting-related methods
    such as GetWaypoint() or ClearWaypoints(). The figure-eight pattern ensures that
    the movement covers a wider area around the target, which is beneficial for maintaining
    distance during combat. The implementation may use trigonometric calculations
    to determine waypoint positions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Passing an invalid radius (negative or zero) may result in undefined
    behavior or no waypoints being generated. This method does not perform collision
    detection, so generated waypoints might lead to movement through obstacles.
