  brief: Saves a guild's emblem data received from the client.
  description: The HandleSaveGuildEmblem method processes a packet containing updated
    guild emblem information sent by the client. It validates the emblem data and
    updates the guild's record in the database with the new emblem details. This method
    is typically invoked when a guild leader or officer modifies their guild's visual
    emblem through the in-game interface. The method ensures that only authorized
    players can modify guild emblems and performs necessary checks to maintain data
    integrity.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSaveGuildEmblem(WorldPackets::Guild::SaveGuildEmblem&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (!GetPlayer() || !GetPlayer()->GetGuild())\n        return;\n\
      \    \n    // Process emblem data\n    GetPlayer()->GetGuild()->SetEmblemInfo(packet.EmblemStyle,\
      \ packet.EmblemColor, packet.BorderStyle, packet.BorderColor);\n    GetPlayer()->GetGuild()->SaveToDB();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the guild management system and requires proper authentication
    checks. The emblem data validation should ensure that only valid color and style
    values are accepted to prevent database corruption.
  warnings: Improper handling of emblem data could lead to invalid database entries
    or visual glitches in the guild interface. Ensure that all packet fields are validated
    before updating the database.
