  class: GossipHandler
  method: GetIconType
  signature: GossipSelectType GossipHandler::GetIconType(uint8 icon) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the gossip select type associated with a given icon index for interaction
    handling in the World of Warcraft client.
  description: The GetIconType method maps an icon index to its corresponding GossipSelectType
    enumeration value. This is used internally by the TrinityCore server to determine
    how to process player interactions with gossip options that have specific icons.
    The method takes a uint8 icon parameter which represents the visual icon identifier
    shown in the gossip window and returns the appropriate GossipSelectType that defines
    the behavior for that interaction type. This functionality is essential for handling
    different types of gossip selections such as quest acceptance, vendor interactions,
    or trainer sessions within the game's dialogue system.
  parameters:
  - name: icon
    description: The icon index value (0-255) representing the visual icon shown in
      the gossip window. Valid values correspond to predefined icon types used by
      the client for different interaction categories.
  returns: Returns a GossipSelectType enumeration value that indicates how the selected
    gossip option should be processed. Possible return values include types like GOSSIP_SELECT_TYPE_QUEST,
    GOSSIP_SELECT_TYPE_VENDOR, GOSSIP_SELECT_TYPE_TRAINER, etc., depending on what
    icon was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine gossip interaction type
    code: "GossipSelectType selectType = handler->GetIconType(3);\n// Returns GOSSIP_SELECT_TYPE_VENDOR\
      \ if icon 3 maps to vendor icon\nif (selectType == GOSSIP_SELECT_TYPE_VENDOR)\n\
      {\n    // Handle vendor interaction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using returned type to route gossip handling
    code: "uint8 iconIndex = player->GetGossipIcon();\nGossipSelectType selectType\
      \ = handler->GetIconType(iconIndex);\nswitch (selectType)\n{\n    case GOSSIP_SELECT_TYPE_QUEST:\n\
      \        // Handle quest gossip\n        break;\n    case GOSSIP_SELECT_TYPE_VENDOR:\n\
      \        // Handle vendor gossip\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Default\
      \ handling\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during gossip selection processing to determine
    appropriate action based on the icon shown. The mapping from icon index to GossipSelectType
    is defined in the server's internal configuration and may vary between different
    TrinityCore versions or custom modifications. The method assumes valid icon indices
    are passed; invalid indices might return unexpected or default values.
  warnings: The method does not validate input parameters, so passing an invalid icon
    index (outside expected range) could result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    GossipSelectType being returned. Always ensure that the icon parameter corresponds
    to a valid predefined icon used by the client.
