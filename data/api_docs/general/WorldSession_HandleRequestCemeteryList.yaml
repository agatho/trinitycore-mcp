documentation:
  brief: Sends a list of available cemeteries to the player's client upon request.
  description: The HandleRequestCemeteryList method is responsible for processing
    a client request to retrieve the list of valid cemeteries (graveyards) that the
    player can be resurrected at. This method is typically invoked when a player attempts
    to access their resurrection options or when they are about to die and need to
    know where they can be resurrected. The method retrieves the appropriate cemetery
    data from the server's database and sends it back to the client in a structured
    packet format. It ensures that only cemeteries relevant to the player's faction
    and current zone are included in the list, respecting game rules and world state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestCemeteryList(WorldPackets::Misc::RequestCemeteryList&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process the request and send cemetery list to player\n\
      \    SendCemeteryList();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's WorldSession handling system and
    integrates with the game's graveyard management system. It relies on the player's
    current location, faction, and zone to determine which cemeteries are valid for
    resurrection.
