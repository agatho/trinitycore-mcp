  signature: void BotSpawnOrchestrator::BotSpawnOrchestrator()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotSpawnOrchestrator class for managing
    bot spawning operations.
  description: The BotSpawnOrchestrator constructor initializes the internal state
    and data structures required for orchestrating the spawning of AI-controlled bots
    within the TrinityCore environment. This method sets up necessary configurations,
    registers event handlers, and prepares the system to handle bot creation requests.
    It ensures that all required subsystems are properly initialized before any bot
    spawning operations can be performed. The constructor typically runs during server
    startup or when a new bot management module is loaded, establishing the foundation
    for subsequent bot-related activities such as spawn scheduling, player assignment,
    and resource allocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a BotSpawnOrchestrator instance
    code: 'BotSpawnOrchestrator* orchestrator = new BotSpawnOrchestrator();

      // The orchestrator is now ready to manage bot spawning operations

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per instance. Multiple instantiations
    may lead to resource conflicts or undefined behavior. The initialization process
    includes setting up internal queues, initializing random number generators for
    spawn timing, and registering with the core game loop for event processing.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly in a multithreaded environment without
    proper synchronization. The orchestrator assumes single-threaded access during
    initialization to prevent race conditions in internal state setup.
