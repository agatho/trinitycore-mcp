  class: SpellModifierByClassMask
  method: SpellModifierByClassMask
  signature: void SpellModifierByClassMask::SpellModifierByClassMask(int * _ownerAura)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spell modifier with class mask data for aura application.
  description: The SpellModifierByClassMask constructor initializes a spell modifier
    object that applies specific modifications to spells based on class masks. This
    method sets up internal state for managing spell modifications tied to player
    classes or creature types, typically used in aura effects that modify spell behavior
    depending on the caster's class. The initialization process involves setting up
    the owner aura reference and preparing data structures needed for class-based
    spell filtering and modification logic. This is a core component of TrinityCore's
    spell system architecture for handling class-specific spell modifications.
  parameters:
  - name: _ownerAura
    description: Pointer to the aura that owns this spell modifier. This reference
      is used to track which aura is applying the class mask modifications and allows
      access to aura properties during spell processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Modifier Initialization
    code: 'Aura* myAura = new Aura();

      SpellModifierByClassMask modifier(&myAura);

      // The modifier is now initialized and ready to apply class-based spell modifications'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore spell
    system when creating aura effects that require class mask filtering. Developers
    should ensure that the _ownerAura parameter points to a valid aura object before
    calling this constructor, as null references may cause undefined behavior during
    spell processing.
  warnings: Improper initialization of the owner aura pointer can lead to crashes
    or incorrect spell behavior. This method should only be called from within the
    TrinityCore spell system's internal code paths where proper aura lifecycle management
    is guaranteed.
