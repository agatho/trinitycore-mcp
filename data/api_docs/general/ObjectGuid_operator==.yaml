  signature: bool ObjectGuid::operator==(const ObjectGuid & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ObjectGuid instances for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a bitwise comparison between two ObjectGuid
    objects to determine if they represent the same game entity. This comparison checks
    whether both GUIDs have identical values, including their type and numeric components.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment, ObjectGuids uniquely identify
    all game objects such as players, creatures, items, and game objects. The method
    is commonly used in game logic to check if two references point to the same entity,
    particularly when handling player interactions, object tracking, or network synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The ObjectGuid instance to compare against the current object. This
      parameter represents another game entity identifier that should be compared
      for equality with the calling object's GUID.
  returns: Returns true if both ObjectGuid instances have identical values, indicating
    they refer to the same game entity; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic GUID comparison
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid1 = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      ObjectGuid guid2 = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      bool areEqual = (guid1 == guid2); // Returns true


      ObjectGuid guid3 = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(67890);

      bool areNotEqual = (guid1 == guid3); // Returns false'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in game object lookup
    code: "Player* player1 = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(guid1);\nPlayer* player2 =\
      \ ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(guid2);\nif (guid1 == guid2)\n{\n    // Both GUIDs\
      \ refer to the same player\n    // Safe to assume player1 and player2 are the\
      \ same object\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The comparison is performed at the bit level, making it very fast. ObjectGuids
    with different types but identical numeric values will not be considered equal.
    This method does not perform any validation or lookup operations; it simply compares
    the stored values directly.
