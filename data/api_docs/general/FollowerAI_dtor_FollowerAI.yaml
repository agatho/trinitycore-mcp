  signature: void FollowerAI::~FollowerAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a FollowerAI instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The FollowerAI destructor is automatically invoked when a FollowerAI
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any resources allocated by the FollowerAI class, including releasing
    references to associated creatures and performing any necessary AI state cleanup.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this destructor is crucial
    for maintaining memory integrity when follower creatures (such as those controlled
    by player characters) are removed from the game world. The destructor does not
    take any parameters and performs no direct actions beyond standard object destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of FollowerAI object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    FollowerAI* follower = new FollowerAI(creature);\n\
      \    // ... use follower ...\n    delete follower; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called during object destruction. Developers
    should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing custom memory management
    patterns. It is important to ensure that all references to the FollowerAI object
    are cleared before deletion to prevent dangling pointers.
