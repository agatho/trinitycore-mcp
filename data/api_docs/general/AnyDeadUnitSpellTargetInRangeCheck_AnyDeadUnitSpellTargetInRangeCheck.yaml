  class: AnyDeadUnitSpellTargetInRangeCheck
  method: AnyDeadUnitSpellTargetInRangeCheck
  signature: void AnyDeadUnitSpellTargetInRangeCheck::AnyDeadUnitSpellTargetInRangeCheck(int
    * searchObj, float range, const int * spellInfo, int check, int objectType)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spell target range check for dead units within a specified
    range.
  description: The AnyDeadUnitSpellTargetInRangeCheck constructor initializes a spell
    target checker that evaluates whether any dead unit is within a given range of
    a search object. This class is typically used in AI or spell targeting logic to
    determine valid targets for spells that can affect dead units, such as resurrection
    effects or death-related abilities. The check considers the type of object being
    searched and validates against a provided spell information structure. It's commonly
    employed in TrinityCore's core AI systems where spell casting behavior needs to
    account for both alive and dead unit targets.
  parameters:
  - name: searchObj
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the search object (typically a
      GameObject or Unit) from which the range check originates. This is used as the
      reference point for distance calculations.
  - name: range
    description: Float value specifying the maximum distance within which dead units
      will be considered valid targets. Units beyond this range are excluded from
      the check.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to an integer representing spell information structure (likely
      a SpellInfo* cast to int) used to validate target eligibility for specific spells
      that can target dead units.
  - name: check
    description: Integer flag or value indicating the type of check to perform. This
      may control whether to include all dead units, only specific types, or apply
      additional filtering criteria.
  - name: objectType
    description: Integer representing the object type to be considered during the
      search. This typically corresponds to ObjectType masks used in TrinityCore's
      object management system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize a dead unit spell target range check
    code: '#include "Spell.h"


      // Example usage in AI logic

      int searchObject = 12345;

      float maxRange = 30.0f;

      int spellInfo = 98765;

      int checkFlag = 1;

      int objType = TYPEMASK_UNIT;


      AnyDeadUnitSpellTargetInRangeCheck checker(&searchObject, maxRange, &spellInfo,
      checkFlag, objType);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is part of TrinityCore's spell targeting system and is likely
    used internally by AI subsystems. The parameters are passed as integers but are
    expected to be pointers or indices that resolve to actual objects in memory. Performance
    depends on the number of units within range being checked.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting object types or spell info can lead to invalid target
    selection. Ensure that searchObj points to a valid object before using this class,
    otherwise behavior is undefined.
