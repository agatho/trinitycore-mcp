  class: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  method: DeleteFromDB
  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::DeleteFromDB(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a quest objective criteria entry from the database using the provided
    GUID.
  description: The DeleteFromDB method is responsible for removing a specific quest
    objective criteria record from the TrinityCore database. This function takes a
    unique identifier (GUID) as input and deletes the corresponding entry from the
    database table that stores quest objective criteria data. The method is typically
    invoked when a quest objective criteria needs to be removed or reset, such as
    during quest cancellation, completion cleanup, or when modifying quest progress.
    It directly interacts with the database layer to ensure data consistency and is
    part of the broader quest management system within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest objective criteria entry
      to be deleted from the database. This parameter represents the primary key used
      to locate and remove the specific record.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete a quest objective criteria by GUID
    code: 'QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr* criteriaMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetQuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr();

      int criteriaGuid = 12345;

      criteriaMgr->DeleteFromDB(criteriaGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct database operation and should be used carefully
    to avoid unintended data loss. The GUID parameter must correspond to an existing
    record in the database, otherwise the operation will have no effect. The method
    is likely thread-safe if used within the context of proper database transaction
    handling.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid quest objective criteria
    entry before calling this method. Improper use may result in attempting to delete
    non-existent records or corrupting data integrity. This method should not be called
    outside of appropriate transactional contexts to prevent database inconsistencies.
