  brief: Updates the map object with new data and handles all associated game mechanics.
  description: The Update method in TrinityCore's Map class is responsible for processing
    and applying updates to the map object, including handling player movements, NPC
    updates, and world state changes. It ensures that all objects within the map are
    properly updated according to their current state and the game's time-based mechanics.
    This method typically runs during each frame update cycle to maintain synchronization
    between the client and server states.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Map Update Usage
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      map->Update(1000);

      // This updates the map with a time interval of 1 second'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during each frame update cycle and may involve
    significant processing depending on the number of objects present in the map.
    Performance considerations include avoiding excessive calls to this method during
    high-traffic periods.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method can lead to synchronization issues between
    client and server states, potentially causing game desynchronization or incorrect
    object positioning.
