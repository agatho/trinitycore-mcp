  method: ApplyDeepWounds
  signature: void ArmsWarriorRefactored::ApplyDeepWounds(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Deep Wounds effect to a target unit, increasing their bleed damage
    over time.
  description: The ApplyDeepWounds method applies the Deep Wounds passive ability
    to a specified target unit. This ability causes the warrior's auto attacks and
    certain abilities to apply a bleed effect that deals additional damage over time.
    The effect increases in potency with each application and stacks up to a maximum
    of 5 times. When applied, it modifies the target's combat state and may trigger
    additional effects such as increased threat generation or proc-based abilities.
    This method is typically called internally by the warrior's attack logic when
    certain conditions are met, such as landing a critical strike or using specific
    abilities that can apply Deep Wounds.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will receive the Deep Wounds effect.
      Must be a valid target unit (player or creature) within combat range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: "void ArmsWarriorRefactored::OnAttack(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (roll_chance_i(30))\
      \ // 30% chance to apply Deep Wounds\n    {\n        ApplyDeepWounds(target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Deep Wounds with ability
    code: "void ArmsWarriorRefactored::ExecuteDeepWoundsAbility(Unit* target)\n{\n\
      \    if (target && target->IsAlive())\n    {\n        ApplyDeepWounds(target);\n\
      \        // Additional logic for ability effects\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies the target's aura stack count and updates combat
    state. It should only be called on valid, alive targets within combat range. The
    actual damage calculation and tick behavior are handled by the target's aura system
    rather than this method directly.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is not null or invalid before calling
    this method. Calling ApplyDeepWounds on non-combat units or dead targets may cause
    undefined behavior or client-side issues.
