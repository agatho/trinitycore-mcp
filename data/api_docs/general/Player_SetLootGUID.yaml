api:
  class: Player
  method: SetLootGUID
  signature: void Player::SetLootGUID(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot GUID for the player, establishing a unique identifier for loot
    tracking purposes.
  description: The SetLootGUID method assigns a specific GUID to the player's loot
    system, which is essential for tracking loot items and managing loot distribution
    within the game. This method typically involves setting a unique identifier that
    corresponds to a particular loot object or container, allowing the game engine
    to properly handle loot-related operations such as loot generation, item distribution,
    and tracking. The GUID value is crucial for maintaining proper synchronization
    between the player's loot system and the server-side loot management mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) that represents the loot object or container
      being assigned to the player. This GUID must be valid and corresponds to a specific
      loot item, chest, or other loot source within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetLootGUID(12345);

      // Sets the loot GUID to 12345 for the player''s loot system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related methods
    and may require synchronization with server-side loot management systems. The
    GUID value should be properly validated to ensure it corresponds to an existing
    loot object within the game world.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect loot tracking, potentially
    causing items to be lost or incorrectly distributed. Care must be taken to ensure
    that the GUID being set is valid and corresponds to a legitimate loot source.
