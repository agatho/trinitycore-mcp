  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SearchUnitInSphere
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SearchUnitInSphere(const int & sphere, int & targetList)
documentation:
  brief: Searches for units within a specified spherical area and populates a target
    list with found units.
  description: 'The SearchUnitInSphere method performs a spatial search around an
    AreaTrigger''s location to identify all units (players, creatures, etc.) that
    are within the defined radius. It updates the provided targetList parameter with
    references to these units. This functionality is commonly used in area-based spells
    or triggers where effects need to be applied to nearby targets. The method operates
    on the principle of checking unit positions against a spherical boundary and adding
    qualifying units to the list for further processing. Precondition: The AreaTrigger
    must be initialized and have a valid position set. Postcondition: The targetList
    parameter is updated with all units found within the specified sphere.'
  parameters:
  - name: sphere
    description: The radius of the spherical area to search for units. Must be a non-negative
      integer value representing the distance in game units (typically yards).
  - name: targetList
    description: Reference to an integer variable that will store the count or identifier
      of found units. The actual list of units is typically managed internally by
      the AreaTrigger class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      int radius = 10;

      int foundUnits = 0;

      trigger->SearchUnitInSphere(radius, foundUnits);

      // foundUnits now contains the number of units within 10-yard radius'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal spatial indexing or collision detection
    systems for performance optimization. It may not return all units if they are
    in different phases or zones unless explicitly configured to do so. The targetList
    parameter is typically an output-only value that reflects the number of units
    found, rather than a list of unit references.
  warnings: Ensure that the AreaTrigger has been properly initialized with a valid
    position before calling this method, otherwise results may be unpredictable. Be
    cautious when using large sphere values as it can impact performance on servers
    with many active units.
