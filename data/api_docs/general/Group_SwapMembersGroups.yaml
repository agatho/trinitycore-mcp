  signature: void Group::SwapMembersGroups(int firstGuid, int secondGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Swaps the group membership of two players identified by their GUIDs within
    the same group.
  description: The SwapMembersGroups method is used to exchange the positions or roles
    of two members within a group. This functionality is typically employed when managing
    group dynamics, such as reorganizing raid groups, swapping loot distribution settings,
    or adjusting player assignments during instance encounters. The method operates
    on the assumption that both players are currently part of the same group and performs
    an internal swap of their group member data without requiring explicit removal
    and re-addition. This operation is generally used for administrative purposes
    within the game's group management system.
  parameters:
  - name: firstGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the first player whose group membership
      will be swapped with the second player.
  - name: secondGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the second player whose group membership
      will be swapped with the first player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Member Swap
    code: "Group* group = player1->GetGroup();\nif (group && group == player2->GetGroup())\
      \ {\n    group->SwapMembersGroups(player1->GetGUID().GetCounter(), player2->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes both players are already members of the same group. It's
    important to verify group membership before calling this function to avoid unexpected
    behavior. The operation modifies internal group data structures and may affect
    loot distribution or role assignments.
  warnings: Calling this method on players not in the same group can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that both GUIDs correspond to valid players who are
    members of the same group before invoking this function.
