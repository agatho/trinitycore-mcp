  class: SceneMgr

  signature: void SceneMgr::RecreateScene(uint32 sceneScriptPackageId, int playbackflags,
    const Position * position)
documentation:
  brief: Recreates a scene using the specified script package ID, playback flags,
    and position.
  description: The RecreateScene method in the SceneMgr class is responsible for reinitializing
    or restarting a scene that was previously created. This function takes a scene
    script package identifier, playback flags to control how the scene should be played
    back, and a position indicating where the scene should be instantiated. It allows
    for dynamic recreation of scenes during gameplay, which can be useful for triggering
    cutscenes, quest events, or other interactive elements that need to be reset or
    re-triggered. The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state
    of the scene manager to reflect the new scene configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: sceneScriptPackageId
    description: The unique identifier for the scene script package that defines the
      scene's behavior and content.
  - name: playbackflags
    description: Flags that control how the scene is played back, such as whether
      it should loop, play in reverse, or be interrupted by player actions.
  - name: position
    description: A pointer to a Position object specifying the world coordinates where
      the scene should be recreated.
  returns: null

    code: 'Position pos;

      pos.x = 100.0f;

      pos.y = 200.0f;

      pos.z = 300.0f;

      sceneMgr->RecreateScene(12345, SCENEFLAG_NONE, &pos);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a scene needs to be reset or re-triggered
    in the game world. Ensure that the scene script package ID corresponds to an existing
    scene definition in the database.
