api:
  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: MonitorEncounterProgress
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::MonitorEncounterProgress(Group * group, uint32
    encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Monitors and tracks the progress of a specific encounter within an instance
    for a given group.
  description: The MonitorEncounterProgress method is responsible for tracking the
    status and progression of a particular encounter within a dungeon or raid instance.
    It ensures that the group's progress through the encounter is properly recorded
    and managed, which may include checking if the encounter has been completed, tracking
    kill counts, or managing rewards. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper instance coordination and ensuring that players receive appropriate rewards
    based on their progress. The method likely integrates with the broader instance
    management system to synchronize encounter states across all members of the group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group whose encounter
      progress is being monitored. Must not be null and must represent a valid group
      in the instance.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific encounter within the instance
      that is being tracked. This ID corresponds to a defined encounter in the instance's
      encounter database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Encounter Progress Monitoring
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = ...; // Assume valid group

      uint32 bossEncounterId = 12345;

      instanceCoordination->MonitorEncounterProgress(playerGroup, bossEncounterId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the instance management system
    when a group enters an encounter or when progress changes. It may also be used
    in conjunction with other coordination methods to ensure all players are synchronized
    regarding encounter status.
