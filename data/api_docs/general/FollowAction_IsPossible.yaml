  signature: bool FollowAction::IsPossible(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot can initiate or continue following a target in the
    World of Warcraft AI system.
  description: The IsPossible method evaluates if the current state of a bot allows
    it to perform a follow action. This includes checking conditions such as whether
    the bot has a valid target, if the target is within acceptable range, and if the
    bot's current AI state permits following behavior. The method is typically called
    before attempting to execute a follow action to ensure that doing so would not
    result in an invalid or harmful operation. It plays a crucial role in the decision-making
    process of bot AI logic, ensuring that actions are only attempted when conditions
    are met.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot can successfully begin or continue following its
    target; otherwise returns false if conditions prevent the follow action from being
    executed safely.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Follow Action is Possible
    code: "if (followAction.IsPossible(ai)) {\n    // Proceed with initiating the\
      \ follow behavior\n    ai->GetBot()->SetFollowTarget(target);\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Handle case where following is not possible\n    ai->TellMaster(\"Cannot\
      \ follow target at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal bot state flags, target validity, and
    distance constraints. It's commonly used in conjunction with other AI action methods
    to build a coherent decision tree for bot behavior.
