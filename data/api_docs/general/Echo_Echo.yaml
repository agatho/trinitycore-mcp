  class: Echo
  method: Echo
  signature: void Echo::Echo(int * tgt, int heals, int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes an echo effect that modifies target values based on heal and amount
    parameters.
  description: The Echo::Echo method is designed to apply a specific echo effect to
    a target integer value. It takes a pointer to an integer target, a heals parameter
    that likely influences healing calculations, and an amount parameter that determines
    the magnitude of the effect. This method appears to be part of a game mechanics
    system where echoes or reverberations are applied to values, possibly in combat
    or spell systems. The method modifies the value pointed to by 'tgt' directly,
    making it a destructive operation that alters the original data. It is typically
    used in scenarios where an effect needs to propagate or amplify based on healing
    and amount parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: tgt
    description: Pointer to an integer target value that will be modified by the echo
      effect. This parameter is passed by reference and will be directly altered by
      the method.
  - name: heals
    description: An integer representing the healing factor or influence that affects
      how the echo modifies the target value. Higher values may amplify the effect.
  - name: amount
    description: An integer specifying the magnitude of the echo effect to be applied
      to the target value. This determines how much the target is modified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Echo Usage
    code: 'int targetValue = 100;

      int heals = 50;

      int amount = 25;

      Echo echoInstance;

      echoInstance.Echo(&targetValue, heals, amount);

      // targetValue is now modified based on the echo effect'
    language: cpp
  - title: Echo in Combat Context
    code: 'int damage = 200;

      int healingFactor = 75;

      int multiplier = 150;

      // Apply echo effect to damage based on healing and amount

      Echo combatEcho;

      combatEcho.Echo(&damage, healingFactor, multiplier);

      // Damage is modified according to the echo mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies data in-place through a pointer parameter. Developers
    must ensure that the target pointer is valid and points to writable memory. The
    exact algorithm for how heals and amount interact with the target value is not
    specified, but it likely involves some form of mathematical transformation or
    scaling.
  warnings: Since this method modifies the value pointed to by 'tgt' directly, passing
    an invalid or null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Ensure that all
    parameters are properly initialized before calling this method.
