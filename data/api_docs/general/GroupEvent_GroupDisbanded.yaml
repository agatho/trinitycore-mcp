  class: GroupEvent
  method: GroupDisbanded
  signature: GroupEvent GroupEvent::GroupDisbanded(int groupGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a GroupEvent object indicating that a group has been disbanded, using
    the specified group GUID.
  description: The GroupDisbanded method is a static factory function within the GroupEvent
    class designed to construct and return a new GroupEvent instance representing
    the event of a World of Warcraft group being disbanded. This method takes a single
    integer parameter representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the disbanded group.
    The returned GroupEvent object can be used to notify players, trigger game logic,
    or update internal systems when a group is dissolved. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining accurate group state information in TrinityCore's player management
    system and ensures proper cleanup of group-related data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: An integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the
      group that has been disbanded. This GUID must correspond to a valid existing
      group in the game world.
  returns: A GroupEvent object initialized with the provided group GUID, representing
    the event of a group disbanding. The returned object can be used for event handling,
    logging, or dispatching notifications to players within the disbanded group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::GroupDisbanded(12345);

      // Creates a GroupEvent representing the disbanding of group with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Event Handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerLeaveGroup(Player* player, uint32 groupId) {\n    // Disband\
      \ the group when a player leaves\n    GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::GroupDisbanded(groupId);\n\
      \    // Process the event to notify other group members\n    ProcessGroupEvent(event);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's group management
    system when a group is disbanded due to all members leaving or explicit disbanding.
    The returned GroupEvent object should be handled appropriately by systems that
    listen for group-related events. This factory method does not perform any validation
    on the provided GUID, so it's assumed that the caller has already verified its
    validity.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided groupGuid parameter corresponds to an actual
    existing group before calling this method, as using an invalid GUID may lead to
    undefined behavior or inconsistent game state. This method should only be called
    when a group is actually being disbanded, not during normal group operations.
