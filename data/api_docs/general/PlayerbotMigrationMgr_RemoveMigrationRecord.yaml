  method: RemoveMigrationRecord
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::RemoveMigrationRecord(const std::string &
    version)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a migration record for the specified version from the playerbot migration
    manager.
  description: The RemoveMigrationRecord method removes a previously stored migration
    record associated with a specific version string from the PlayerbotMigrationMgr.
    This method is typically used during playerbot system upgrades or when cleaning
    up outdated migration data. The operation returns true if the record was successfully
    found and removed, or false if no matching record exists. This functionality supports
    the playerbot system's ability to track and manage version-specific changes and
    updates.
  parameters:
  - name: version
    description: The version string identifier for which the migration record should
      be removed. This typically represents a specific playerbot system version or
      patch level.
  returns: True if a migration record matching the specified version was found and
    successfully removed; false if no such record exists or if the removal operation
    failed.
  examples:
  - title: Remove a specific migration record
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr* mgr = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance();\nbool success\
      \ = mgr->RemoveMigrationRecord(\"3.3.5a\");\nif (success) {\n    // Migration\
      \ record for version 3.3.5a was removed\n    sLog->outString(\"Successfully\
      \ removed migration record for version 3.3.5a\");\n} else {\n    // No migration\
      \ record found for version 3.3.5a\n    sLog->outString(\"No migration record\
      \ found for version 3.3.5a\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with an internal data structure or database
    to store and manage migration records. It may be called during system initialization,
    version updates, or cleanup operations. The method is expected to be thread-safe
    as part of the playerbot system's architecture.
  warnings: Calling this method on a version that has not been previously recorded
    may result in a false return value without any error. Ensure that version strings
    match exactly with those previously stored to avoid unintended behavior.
