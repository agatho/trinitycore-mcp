  class: HealerPositioning
  method: OptimizeHealingCoverage
  signature: int HealerPositioning::OptimizeHealingCoverage(Player * healer, const
    int & allies)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal positioning for a healer to maximize healing
    coverage of allied targets.
  description: The OptimizeHealingCoverage method determines the best location for
    a healer player to position themselves in order to effectively heal the maximum
    number of allied units within their range. This method evaluates the spatial distribution
    of allies, their health status, and the healer's abilities to compute an ideal
    positioning strategy that maximizes healing efficiency. It is typically used in
    AI-driven gameplay scenarios or automated healer positioning systems. The method
    assumes that the healer and allies are already present in the same zone and that
    the healer has sufficient mana and line-of-sight to cast healing spells on targets.
  parameters:
  - name: healer
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the healer whose positioning
      is being optimized. Must be a valid player instance with healer class and active
      in the game world.
  - name: allies
    description: Integer reference indicating the number of allied targets that should
      be considered for optimal healing coverage. This value determines how many units
      the method will evaluate when calculating positioning.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated optimal positioning index
    or identifier. A positive value typically indicates a successful calculation and
    valid position, while zero or negative values may indicate insufficient targets,
    invalid parameters, or failure to compute a viable position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeHealingCoverage
    code: "Player* healer = ...; // Assume initialized\nint allyCount = 5;\nint optimalPosition\
      \ = healer->GetHealerPositioning()->OptimizeHealingCoverage(healer, allyCount);\n\
      if (optimalPosition > 0) {\n    // Proceed with moving to the calculated position\n\
      \    healer->MoveToPosition(optimalPosition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with dynamic ally count
    code: "Player* healer = ...; // Assume initialized\nint allyCount = GetNearbyAllyCount(healer,\
      \ 30.0f); // Get allies within 30 yards\nif (allyCount > 0) {\n    int optimalPosition\
      \ = healer->GetHealerPositioning()->OptimizeHealingCoverage(healer, allyCount);\n\
      \    if (optimalPosition > 0) {\n        MoveToOptimalHealingPosition(healer,\
      \ optimalPosition);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform calculations involving distance metrics, target health
    percentages, and spell range limitations. It is recommended to call this method
    only when the healer's position or the ally configuration has changed significantly
    to avoid unnecessary performance overhead. The method does not directly move the
    healer but rather returns a calculated positioning value that can be used by other
    systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'healer' parameter is a valid pointer and that the player
    is in an active game state before calling this method. Passing invalid or uninitialized
    ally counts may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect positioning results. The
    method assumes that all allies are within reasonable proximity for healing spells
    to be effective.
