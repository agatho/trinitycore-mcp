  signature: bool Creature::IsAffectedByDiminishingReturns() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is affected by diminishing returns mechanics.
  description: This method checks if a creature is subject to diminishing returns,
    which is a game mechanic that reduces the effectiveness of certain spells or abilities
    based on the creature's previous exposure to similar effects. The method evaluates
    whether the creature's current state allows it to be influenced by diminishing
    returns, typically used in spell handling and combat calculations within TrinityCore's
    core mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is affected by diminishing returns, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the creature's behavior or status may be modified
    by diminishing return effects, which are commonly applied to spells like crowd
    control, debuffs, or other affecting abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->IsAffectedByDiminishingReturns()) {\n    // Handle creature's\
      \ diminished returns behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine whether a creature's status should be modified by diminishing return
    effects. It may be called during spell application or removal processes.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method, as incorrect usage can lead
    to improper handling of spell effects and potentially cause gameplay imbalance.
    The method should only be used in contexts where the creature's state is already
    known to be affected by diminishing returns.
