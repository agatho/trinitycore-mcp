documentation:
  brief: Initializes and begins a battlefield battle, setting up the necessary game
    state and triggers associated events.
  description: The OnBattleStart method is invoked when a Battlefield instance commences
    its battle phase. This method handles the initialization of all battlefield-related
    systems including player registration, objective setup, and event triggering.
    It ensures that all participants are properly configured for combat and that the
    battlefield's core mechanics are activated. The method typically runs during the
    transition from the pre-battle preparation phase to active combat, ensuring that
    all necessary systems are in place before players engage in battle. This method
    does not accept any parameters and performs no direct return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Battlefield Start Usage
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    bf->OnBattleStart();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore battlefield
    management system during battle initialization. Developers should not call this
    method directly unless implementing custom battlefield logic. The method may perform
    operations that affect multiple players and should be considered a critical part
    of the battlefield lifecycle.
  warnings: Direct invocation of OnBattleStart without proper battlefield setup can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method assumes all prerequisites for
    battle commencement are already met, including player registration and objective
    initialization.
