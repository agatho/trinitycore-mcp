documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with a mount entry, determining its behavior
    and availability conditions.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags that define various properties and restrictions for a specific mount
    entry in the TrinityCore database. These flags control aspects such as whether
    the mount is account-bound, if it requires specific spells or achievements to
    be learned, or if it's only available during certain events. The returned value
    combines multiple flag bits using bitwise operations, allowing for efficient storage
    and retrieval of complex mount attributes. This method is commonly used in player
    interaction logic to validate mount usability and display appropriate UI elements
    based on mount restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flag bits for this mount entry. Each
    bit corresponds to a specific property or restriction, such as account-bound status,
    spell requirements, or event-based availability. The exact meaning of each bit
    must be interpreted using predefined constants from the TrinityCore codebase.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a mount is account-bound
    code: "MountEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetMountEntry(12345);\nif (entry && (entry->GetFlags()\
      \ & MOUNT_FLAG_ACCOUNT_BOUND)) {\n    // Mount is account-bound\n    printf(\"\
      This mount is bound to the account.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate mount availability based on flags
    code: "MountEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetMountEntry(player->GetMountId());\n\
      if (entry) {\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (!(flags & MOUNT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE))\
      \ {\n        // Mount can be selected by player\n        player->SetMountDisplayId(displayId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flag values are defined in the TrinityCore source code and typically
    correspond to specific mount behaviors. Developers should refer to the MountFlags
    enum or related constants in the codebase for proper interpretation of individual
    bits. This method performs no computation and returns a cached value, making it
    efficient to call frequently.
  warnings: Incorrectly interpreting flag bits can lead to unexpected behavior in
    mount availability or selection logic. Always use predefined flag constants rather
    than hardcoded values when checking specific flag conditions.
