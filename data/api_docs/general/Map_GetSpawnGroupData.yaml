documentation:
  brief: Returns the spawn group template data for a specified group ID.
  description: This method retrieves the spawn group template data associated with
    a given group ID from the map's internal spawn group storage. It is used to access
    detailed information about how objects are spawned in specific groups, including
    their spawn conditions and probabilities. The method allows developers to query
    spawn group data without needing to know the exact internal structure of the map's
    spawn system, making it useful for implementing custom spawn logic or debugging
    spawn-related issues. This function is typically called during map initialization
    or when processing spawn groups during game events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the SpawnGroupTemplateData structure corresponding
    to the given group ID. If no matching group is found, it returns nullptr, indicating
    that the group ID does not exist in the map's spawn group data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const SpawnGroupTemplateData* data = map->GetSpawnGroupData(12345);\nif\
      \ (data)\n{\n    // Process spawn group data\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "uint32 groupId = 54321;\nconst SpawnGroupTemplateData* data = map->GetSpawnGroupData(groupId);\n\
      if (data && data->conditions)\n{\n    // Check spawn conditions\n    uint32\
      \ conditionId = data->conditions->conditionId;\n    // Use conditionId for further\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It does not
    perform any validation checks on the group ID itself, so calling code should ensure
    that the ID is valid before invoking this method. Performance-wise, it uses a
    hash map lookup internally, making it relatively fast for most use cases.
  warnings: The method returns nullptr if no matching spawn group data exists for
    the given group ID. Developers should always check for null before dereferencing
    the returned pointer to avoid crashes or undefined behavior.
