  brief: Updates the personal GUID for the phase shift manager
  description: The UpdatePersonalGuid method is responsible for refreshing or setting
    the unique identifier (GUID) associated with the current player's phase shift
    state. This method ensures that the phase shift system maintains accurate tracking
    of the player's identity within different game phases, particularly important
    for managing visibility and interaction in phased environments. The method typically
    gets invoked when a player's GUID changes or when phase shift data needs to be
    synchronized with the current session state.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    player login or when phase shift data needs to be refreshed. It's important for
    maintaining synchronization between client and server phase shift states.
