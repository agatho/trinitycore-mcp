  method: GetQuestSlotQuestId
  signature: uint32 Player::GetQuestSlotQuestId(uint16 slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the quest ID assigned to a specific quest slot in the player's quest
    log.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier (ID) of the quest currently
    assigned to a specified quest slot in the player's active quest log. The quest
    slot is typically used to manage quest progress and tracking within the game interface.
    This method is commonly used when checking or updating quest status, especially
    during quest completion or progression events. It allows developers to access
    specific quest information without needing to iterate through all quest slots.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot index (0-19) to retrieve the quest ID from. This represents
      a specific position in the player's quest log where a quest is stored.
  returns: Returns the unique quest ID assigned to the specified quest slot, or 0
    if no quest is present in that slot. A value of 0 indicates either an empty slot
    or invalid slot index.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 questId = player->GetQuestSlotQuestId(0);\nif (questId != 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Quest exists in slot 0\n    printf(\"Quest ID: %u\\n\", questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's quest management system and should be
    used carefully when dealing with quest progression. The slot index must be within
    valid range (0-19), otherwise behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other quest-related
    methods, as incorrect slot indices may lead to unexpected results or errors. Also
    note that quest IDs returned may not always correspond to active quests, especially
    if the player has completed or abandoned a quest.
