documentation:
  brief: Triggers a scene event with the specified instance ID and trigger name.
  description: The OnSceneTrigger method is used to initiate a scene event within
    the TrinityCore framework. It takes a scene instance identifier and a trigger
    name as parameters, which together define the specific scene sequence to be executed.
    This method is typically invoked when a player interacts with a scene object or
    when a scripted event occurs that requires the activation of a predefined scene.
    The method does not return any value but may cause various game mechanics to be
    triggered depending on how the scene is configured, such as NPC animations, camera
    movements, or quest progress updates.
  parameters:
  - name: sceneInstanceID
    description: Unique identifier for the scene instance to be triggered. This ID
      corresponds to a specific scene definition in the database or script configuration.
  - name: triggerName
    description: Name of the trigger that activates the scene. This string identifies
      which part of the scene should be executed, such as 'Start', 'End', or custom
      trigger names defined in the scene setup.
  returns: null

  - title: Triggering a Scene Based on Quest State
    code: "if (player->GetQuestStatus(54321) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n    SceneMgr::OnSceneTrigger(67890,\

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the scene management system and relies on proper scene
    definitions being present in the database or script files. Ensure that the scene
    instance ID and trigger name are valid to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of scene instance IDs or invalid trigger names may lead
    to silent failures or incorrect scene execution. Always validate inputs before
    calling this method.
