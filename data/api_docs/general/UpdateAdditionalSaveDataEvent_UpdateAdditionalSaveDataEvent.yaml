  method: UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent
  signature: void UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent::UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent(const
    char * key, std::variant<int64, double> value)
documentation:
  brief: Updates additional save data with a key-value pair where value can be either
    an int64 or double.
  description: The UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent::UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent method
    is used to store or update arbitrary key-value pairs in the additional save data
    system. This functionality allows for flexible storage of custom data associated
    with entities such as players, creatures, or game objects that persist across
    sessions. The value parameter accepts either an int64 or double type through std::variant,
    enabling support for both integer and floating-point numeric values. This method
    is typically invoked during events or updates when additional persistent data
    needs to be recorded or modified in the database.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: A null-terminated character string representing the unique identifier
      for the data entry. Keys must be non-null and should follow naming conventions
      appropriate for database fields.
  - name: value
    description: A std::variant containing either an int64 or double value to be stored
      under the specified key. The variant ensures type safety while allowing flexible
      data types within a single parameter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Player Score
    code: 'UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent event;

      int64 playerScore = 12345;

      event.UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent("player_score", playerScore);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Storing Floating Point Progress
    code: 'UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent event;

      double progress = 98.76;

      event.UpdateAdditionalSaveDataEvent("quest_progress", progress);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's persistent data storage
    system and may trigger database write operations depending on implementation details.
    It is recommended to use concise, unique keys for better maintainability.
  warnings: Ensure that the key string is valid and does not contain special characters
    that could cause issues in database queries. Avoid frequent calls to this method
    in performance-critical sections of code due to potential I/O overhead.
