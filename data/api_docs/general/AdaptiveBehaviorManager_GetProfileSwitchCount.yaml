  method: GetProfileSwitchCount
  signature: uint32 AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetProfileSwitchCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of profile switches performed by the adaptive behavior
    manager.
  description: The GetProfileSwitchCount method retrieves the cumulative count of
    profile switches executed by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance. This counter
    tracks how many times the AI behavior has transitioned between different configured
    profiles, which is useful for monitoring and debugging adaptive AI behavior in
    World of Warcraft. The value is typically incremented each time a profile switch
    occurs due to changing conditions or thresholds within the adaptive system. This
    method provides read-only access to an internal counter that persists throughout
    the lifetime of the manager instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of profile switches that have
    occurred since the AdaptiveBehaviorManager was initialized. Returns 0 if no switches
    have been performed yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = player->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      uint32 switchCount = behaviorManager->GetProfileSwitchCount();

      printf("Profile switches performed: %u\n", switchCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Behavior Switches
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = unit->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();\n\
      uint32 previousSwitches = manager->GetProfileSwitchCount();\n// ... perform\
      \ AI actions that may trigger profile switches ...\nuint32 currentSwitches =\
      \ manager->GetProfileSwitchCount();\nif (currentSwitches > previousSwitches)\n\
      {\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_AI, \"AI profile switched %u times since last\
      \ check\", currentSwitches - previousSwitches);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    value is an atomic counter that may be incremented concurrently by different threads
    during AI processing. Performance impact is minimal as it only reads a simple
    integer value.
  warnings: The profile switch count does not reset automatically after each combat
    or encounter, so it represents a cumulative total. Be cautious when using this
    value for long-term behavior tracking as it will continue to increase throughout
    the lifetime of the manager instance.
