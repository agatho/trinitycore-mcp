  class: BotProfiler
  method: BuildCallTree
  signature: void BotProfiler::BuildCallTree(ProfilingSession * session)
documentation:
  brief: Builds a call tree structure for profiling session data.
  description: The BuildCallTree method constructs a hierarchical representation of
    function calls within a profiling session. This method processes the collected
    profiling data and organizes it into a tree structure that allows for analysis
    of execution flow and performance bottlenecks. The resulting call tree provides
    insights into which functions are called most frequently and how execution time
    is distributed across different code paths. This functionality is essential for
    optimizing bot behavior and identifying inefficient code patterns in TrinityCore's
    AI systems.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the ProfilingSession object containing collected profiling
      data to be processed into a call tree structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      ProfilingSession* session = new ProfilingSession();

      // ... populate session with profiling data ...

      profiler.BuildCallTree(session);

      // Call tree is now constructed and available for analysis'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ProfilingSession object has been properly initialized
    and contains valid profiling data. The call tree construction process may be computationally
    intensive for sessions with large amounts of profiling data. Thread safety is
    not guaranteed if multiple threads access the same session concurrently.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initializing the ProfilingSession
    parameter may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all profiling
    data has been collected before invoking this method to avoid incomplete call tree
    structures.
