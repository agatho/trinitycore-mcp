documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has beneficial buffs from the Roll the Bones ability.
  description: The HasGoodBuffs method determines whether the player currently possesses
    any of the positive buff effects granted by the Roll the Bones ability in World
    of Warcraft's Rogue class. This method evaluates the active buff states on the
    player character and returns true if at least one beneficial buff from Roll the
    Bones is present, otherwise false. The Roll the Bones ability provides various
    temporary buffs such as increased critical strike chance, haste, mastery, or versatility
    depending on the roll result. This check is typically used in game logic to determine
    when certain abilities or effects should be applied or modified based on the presence
    of these buffs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has any beneficial buff from Roll the Bones
    active; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (rollTheBonesTracker.HasGoodBuffs()) {\n    // Apply additional effects\
      \ or modify behavior\n    player->AddAura(SPELL_ROLL_THE_BONES_BONUS_AURA);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Activation
    code: "if (rollTheBonesTracker.HasGoodBuffs()) {\n    // Player has good buffs,\
      \ enable enhanced combo point generation\n    player->SetComboPoints(player->GetComboPoints()\
      \ + 1);\n} else {\n    // No good buffs, normal combo point behavior\n    player->SetComboPoints(player->GetComboPoints());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only checks for the presence of beneficial buffs and does not
    distinguish between different types of buffs from Roll the Bones. The implementation
    likely relies on checking active aura applications with specific spell IDs related
    to Roll the Bones effects.
  warnings: The method assumes that the player's buff state is properly maintained
    by the game engine. If used outside of a proper game context or with an uninitialized
    tracker, it may return incorrect results.
