documentation:
  brief: Returns the type identifier of the execution context
  description: The GetType method retrieves the ContextType enumeration value that
    represents the specific type of execution context this object instance represents.
    This is used internally by the TrinityCore AI system to determine how to process
    different types of contexts, such as global, creature, player, or GameObject contexts.
    The returned value directly corresponds to the context's role in the AI decision-making
    hierarchy and affects which actions and behaviors are available for execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ContextType enumeration value indicating the specific type of execution
    context. Possible values include but are not limited to GLOBAL_CONTEXT, CREATURE_CONTEXT,
    PLAYER_CONTEXT, GAMEOBJECT_CONTEXT, and others depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine context type
    code: "ExecutionContext* context = new CreatureExecutionContext(creature);\nContextType\
      \ type = context->GetType();\nif (type == ContextType::CREATURE_CONTEXT)\n{\n\
      \    // Handle creature-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using context type in AI decision making
    code: "void MyAIHandler(ExecutionContext* context)\n{\n    switch (context->GetType())\n\
      \    {\n        case ContextType::PLAYER_CONTEXT:\n            // Process player-specific\
      \ actions\n            break;\n        case ContextType::CREATURE_CONTEXT:\n\
      \            // Process creature-specific actions\n            break;\n    \
      \    default:\n            // Handle unknown context types\n            break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a pure getter and does not modify the state of the ExecutionContext
    object. It's typically called frequently during AI processing loops, so performance
    should be considered in high-frequency scenarios. The ContextType enumeration
    values are defined in the core TrinityCore AI system and should not be modified
    without understanding the entire system impact.
  warnings: Do not assume that all possible ContextType values are explicitly handled
    in your code. New context types may be added in future updates, so consider using
    a default case or error handling for unknown types. The method returns a constant
    value, so caching the result is unnecessary unless the context type might change
    during execution.
