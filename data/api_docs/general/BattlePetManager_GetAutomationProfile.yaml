  class: BattlePetManager
  method: GetAutomationProfile
  signature: PetBattleAutomationProfile BattlePetManager::GetAutomationProfile(uint32
    playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the automation profile configured for a specific player's pet battles.
  description: The GetAutomationProfile method fetches the PetBattleAutomationProfile
    associated with a given player, identified by their GUID. This profile defines
    how pet battles are automated for that player, including settings such as whether
    to auto-attack, auto-feed pets, or use specific battle strategies. The method
    is typically used in the context of managing player behavior during pet battles
    within World of Warcraft's Battle Pet system. It ensures that each player's automation
    preferences are correctly applied during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose automation profile
      is being retrieved. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game
      world.
  returns: A PetBattleAutomationProfile object containing the automation settings
    for the specified player. If no profile exists for the player, a default or empty
    profile may be returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Automation Profile for a Player
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nPetBattleAutomationProfile profile = battlePetManager->GetAutomationProfile(playerId);\n\
      // Use profile settings to configure pet battle behavior\nif (profile.autoAttack)\n\
      {\n    // Enable auto-attack logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BattlePetManager class, which handles all aspects
    of pet battle automation and management. The returned profile object should be
    used carefully as it may influence gameplay behavior during pet battles.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method is valid; invalid or
    non-existent GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or errors in retrieving the
    automation profile.
