  method: IsPlayerbotEnabled
  signature: bool PlayerbotWorldScript::IsPlayerbotEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether playerbot functionality is enabled in the world.
  description: The IsPlayerbotEnabled method determines if the playerbot system is
    currently active within the TrinityCore instance. This system allows for AI-controlled
    player characters to be created and managed by the game server. The method returns
    a boolean value indicating the global state of playerbot support. This check is
    typically used before attempting to interact with playerbots or to determine if
    certain bot-related features should be available to players. The functionality
    can be toggled via configuration settings or server commands, making this method
    essential for conditional logic in bot-related systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if playerbot functionality is enabled and active; returns
    false if playerbots are disabled or not supported in the current world instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (sPlayerbotAI->IsPlayerbotEnabled()) {\n    // Playerbot functionality\
      \ is available\n    sWorld->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_STRING, \"Playerbots\
      \ are enabled.\");\n} else {\n    // Playerbot functionality is disabled\n \
      \   sWorld->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_STRING, \"Playerbots are disabled.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple boolean check against an internal configuration
    flag. It does not perform any complex validation or runtime checks. The result
    may change during server operation if playerbot settings are modified via in-game
    commands or configuration files.
