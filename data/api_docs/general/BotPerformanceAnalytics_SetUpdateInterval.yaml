  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: SetUpdateInterval
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::SetUpdateInterval(uint64_t intervalMicroseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for bot performance analytics in microseconds.
  description: The SetUpdateInterval method configures how frequently the BotPerformanceAnalytics
    system collects and processes performance data for AI bots. This interval determines
    the granularity of performance metrics and affects system resource usage. The
    method accepts a time interval specified in microseconds, which controls how often
    internal performance sampling occurs. Setting this value too low may increase
    CPU overhead, while setting it too high may reduce the responsiveness of performance
    monitoring. This parameter directly influences the frequency at which bot behavior
    and resource consumption are recorded for analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMicroseconds
    description: The time interval between performance updates in microseconds. Valid
      values are positive integers representing the desired sampling frequency. Lower
      values (e.g., 1000) result in more frequent updates and higher precision, while
      higher values (e.g., 1000000) reduce update frequency and system load.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Performance Update Interval
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.SetUpdateInterval(500000); // Set to 0.5 second intervals'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure High-Frequency Monitoring
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.SetUpdateInterval(10000); // Set to 10ms intervals for detailed monitoring'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during initialization or configuration of bot
    performance monitoring systems. The interval value should be chosen based on the
    desired balance between monitoring precision and system performance impact. Updates
    are processed asynchronously to minimize disruption to bot operations.
  warnings: Setting extremely low intervals may cause performance degradation due
    to excessive CPU usage from frequent sampling. Ensure that the interval is appropriate
    for your server's capabilities and monitoring requirements.
