  method: GetEvokerOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetEvokerOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of offensive cooldowns currently active on the evoker
    player.
  description: The GetEvokerOffensiveCooldowns method is used within the PvPCombatAI
    class to determine how many offensive cooldowns are currently active for an evoker
    player. This information is crucial for AI decision-making in PvP scenarios, particularly
    when determining whether a player can use certain abilities or spells that are
    on cooldown. The method takes a pointer to a player object and returns an integer
    representing the count of active offensive cooldowns. It's designed to be used
    in combat situations where timing and ability usage are critical for success.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the evoker whose offensive
      cooldowns are being checked. This parameter must point to a valid Player instance;
      otherwise, behavior is undefined.
  returns: An integer value representing the number of active offensive cooldowns
    on the specified evoker player. Returns 0 if no offensive cooldowns are active
    or if the input player pointer is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* evoker = ...; // Get a reference to an evoker player\nint cooldownCount\
      \ = ai->GetEvokerOffensiveCooldowns(evoker);\nif (cooldownCount == 0) {\n  \
      \  // Player can use offensive abilities\n    // Execute offensive action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Decision Making
    code: "Player* evoker = ...;\nPvPCombatAI* ai = ...;\nint cooldowns = ai->GetEvokerOffensiveCooldowns(evoker);\n\
      if (cooldowns < 3) {\n    // Consider using a powerful ability if available\n\
      \    // Avoid spamming abilities when cooldowns are high\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and is intended for internal
    AI logic. It relies on the player's current state and may not reflect real-time
    changes if called outside of combat updates. The method assumes that the player
    object passed in is valid and represents an evoker class.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid player pointer to this method will result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is properly initialized and
    represents an evoker before calling this method. This function should only be
    called during active combat scenarios for meaningful results.
