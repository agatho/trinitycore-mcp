  signature: void RecipeProgressionInfo::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes recipe progression data to a ByteBuffer for client synchronization
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes recipe progression information into
    a ByteBuffer format suitable for network transmission to players. This method
    is typically used when sending initial recipe state data to clients, particularly
    during player login or when a new recipe becomes available. The serialization
    process includes relevant recipe progress statistics and ownership details that
    are necessary for client-side UI updates and gameplay mechanics. The method requires
    both owner and receiver player references to properly format the data according
    to TrinityCore's packet structure conventions.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized recipe progression
      data will be written
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object who owns the recipe progression data,
      used for determining ownership context
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the packet, used for
      proper client synchronization and visibility checks
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet creation
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = player1;

      Player* receiver = player2;

      recipeProgression.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      WorldPacket packet(SMSG_UPDATE_RECIPE_PROGRESS, data.size());

      packet.append(data);

      receiver->SendDirectMessage(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's recipe progression system and should
    only be called when preparing data for network transmission. The ByteBuffer must
    be properly initialized before calling this method, and both player pointers should
    be valid to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that both owner and receiver player pointers are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid pointers may cause crashes or undefined behavior. This
    method modifies the provided ByteBuffer directly, so ensure proper synchronization
    if used in multi-threaded contexts.
