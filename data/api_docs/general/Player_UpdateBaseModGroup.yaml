  signature: void Player::UpdateBaseModGroup(int modGroup)
documentation:
  brief: Updates base modifiers for the specified modifier group.
  description: The UpdateBaseModGroup method recalculates and applies base modifiers
    for a given modifier group to the player's statistics. This method is typically
    invoked when changes occur to the player's stats that affect specific modifier
    groups, such as armor, weapon damage, or resistances. It ensures that all relevant
    base modifiers are properly updated and reflected in the player's current stat
    calculations. The method operates on internal modifier data structures and does
    not directly modify visible attributes but rather prepares them for recalculation
    by other systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update base modifiers for armor group
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateBaseModGroup(BASEMOD_ARMOR);

      // This updates all armor-related base modifiers for the player.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core when stat modifications
    occur. Developers should not typically call this directly unless implementing
    custom stat systems or debugging modifier calculations. The method may trigger
    recalculations of dependent stats such as total armor, damage reduction, or resistance
    values.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may lead to inconsistent stat
    states. It's recommended to use this only when you understand the underlying modifier
    system and its dependencies.
