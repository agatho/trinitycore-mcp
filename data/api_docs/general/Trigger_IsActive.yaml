  signature: bool Trigger::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the trigger is currently active and ready to execute its associated
    actions.
  description: The IsActive method determines if a Trigger object is currently in
    an active state, meaning it can respond to events or conditions that would cause
    it to activate. This method is commonly used within the TrinityCore framework
    to manage trigger-based systems such as quest triggers, area triggers, or event-based
    activations. The return value indicates whether the trigger's internal state allows
    it to perform its intended function at the time of the call. Triggers may be inactive
    due to cooldowns, disabled states, or other game logic constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trigger is currently active and can execute its associated
    actions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check trigger status
    code: "if (trigger->IsActive()) {\n    // Perform action only if trigger is active\n\
      \    trigger->Execute();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsActive in a loop for continuous monitoring
    code: "while (true) {\n    if (trigger->IsActive()) {\n        trigger->Activate();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Handle inactive state\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically lightweight and should not cause performance issues
    when called frequently. It's important to note that IsActive does not modify the
    trigger's state but only reads it, making it safe for use in read-only contexts.
