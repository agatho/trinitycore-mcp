  brief: Processes and handles trash mob pulls within the advanced behavior manager
    system
  description: The HandleTrashPull method manages the logic for processing trash mob
    encounters in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment. This method is responsible
    for determining how the AI should respond when trash mobs are pulled, including
    handling initial aggro, positioning, and tactical decisions during these encounters.
    It typically integrates with the broader behavior tree system to ensure proper
    execution of combat strategies for non-boss enemies. The method operates within
    the context of advanced AI behaviors and is designed to maintain consistent gameplay
    mechanics across different trash mob scenarios.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n    if\
      \ (m_isTrashPullActive)\n        m_behaviorManager->HandleTrashPull();\n   \
      \ // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles when trash mob encounters
    are detected. It assumes that the necessary context (such as target information
    and combat state) has already been established by other systems in the behavior
    manager. The implementation may vary depending on the specific creature type and
    encounter design.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to inconsistent AI behavior
    during trash mob encounters, potentially causing mobs to not engage properly or
    behave unpredictably. Ensure that all prerequisite conditions for trash pull detection
    are met before calling this method.
