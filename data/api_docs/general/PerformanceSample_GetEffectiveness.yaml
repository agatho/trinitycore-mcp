  class: PerformanceSample
  method: GetEffectiveness
  signature: float PerformanceSample::GetEffectiveness() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the effectiveness ratio of a performance sample.
  description: The GetEffectiveness method computes a normalized effectiveness value
    for a PerformanceSample object, typically representing how well a specific action
    or ability performed relative to its expected or maximum potential. This value
    is often used in performance analysis, combat metrics, or skill evaluation systems
    within TrinityCore's framework. The method does not modify any internal state
    and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the effectiveness ratio, typically ranging from
    0.0 (least effective) to 1.0 (most effective). Values may exceed 1.0 in cases
    where performance surpasses expected thresholds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PerformanceSample sample;

      float effectiveness = sample.GetEffectiveness();

      // Returns a normalized effectiveness value between 0.0 and 1.0

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Combat Analysis
    code: "void AnalyzeCombatPerformance(Player* player) {\n    PerformanceSample\
      \ sample = player->GetCombatPerformance();\n    float effectiveness = sample.GetEffectiveness();\n\
      \    if (effectiveness > 0.9f) {\n        // High performance alert\n      \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Player %s has exceptional combat effectiveness.\", player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other performance metrics
    to provide a comprehensive view of character or ability performance. It may internally
    utilize historical data, baseline values, and normalization techniques to compute
    the final effectiveness score.
  warnings: Ensure that the PerformanceSample object has been properly initialized
    before calling this method, as uninitialized or invalid samples may produce unexpected
    results. The returned value is a floating-point approximation and should be compared
    using appropriate tolerance thresholds when necessary.
