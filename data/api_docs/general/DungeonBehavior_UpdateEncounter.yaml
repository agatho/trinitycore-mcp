  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: UpdateEncounter
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::UpdateEncounter(Group * group, uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the encounter state for a group within a dungeon.
  description: The UpdateEncounter method is responsible for managing and updating
    the current encounter state within a dungeon instance for a specified group. This
    method typically handles the progression or reset of encounters based on group
    activity, player actions, or game mechanics such as boss fights. It ensures that
    the dungeon's encounter tracking system remains synchronized with the actual progress
    of the group through the dungeon content. The method may be invoked when players
    engage with encounters, defeat bosses, or when certain conditions are met within
    the dungeon environment.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group whose encounter
      state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific encounter within the dungeon that
      should be updated. Represents the encounter's ID in the game's database or encounter
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = ...; // Assume group is initialized

      uint32 currentEncounterId = 12345;

      DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.UpdateEncounter(playerGroup, currentEncounterId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal dungeon tracking systems and may
    trigger updates to the group's encounter progress, timers, or loot distribution.
    It is typically called during gameplay events such as boss defeat or group progression.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Group pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method to prevent crashes or undefined behavior. The encounterId must correspond
    to a valid encounter in the dungeon's encounter system.
