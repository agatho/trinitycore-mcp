documentation:
  brief: Stops the current gathering process for a player
  description: The StopGathering method terminates any active gathering operation
    that is currently in progress for the player. This method is typically invoked
    when a player manually cancels their gathering action, moves out of range of the
    gatherable object, or when the gathering session is otherwise interrupted. The
    method ensures that all related resources are properly released and that the player's
    gathering state is reset to an inactive condition. It may also trigger cleanup
    operations such as removing temporary game objects or updating the player's UI
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GatheringManager* manager = player->GetGatheringManager();

      manager->StopGathering();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a gathering operation is actively
    in progress. Calling it without an active gathering session may result in undefined
    behavior or unnecessary overhead.
