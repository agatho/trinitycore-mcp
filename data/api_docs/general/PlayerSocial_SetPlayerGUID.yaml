documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the player for the social list entry
  description: The SetPlayerGUID method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to the
    player within the PlayerSocial class. This method is typically used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to maintain the relationship between a player's social
    data and their in-game character. The GUID represents the player's unique identification
    within the game world and is essential for social interactions such as friend
    lists, ignore lists, and group communications. This method does not perform any
    validation on the provided GUID value and assumes it is a valid player identifier
    from the database.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to set in the social list
      entry. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from the database or game
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Player GUID in Social List
    code: 'PlayerSocial* social = new PlayerSocial();

      uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      social->SetPlayerGUID(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal player social system and should typically
    be called during player loading or when initializing social data. The GUID parameter
    is expected to be a valid database identifier for an existing player character.
