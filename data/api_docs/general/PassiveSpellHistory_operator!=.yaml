documentation:
  brief: Compares two PassiveSpellHistory objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this PassiveSpellHistory
    object and another PassiveSpellHistory object to determine if they are not equal.
    This comparison typically checks the internal state or data members of both objects
    to see if any differences exist. In the context of TrinityCore's spell system,
    this might be used to verify that two passive spell histories differ in their
    recorded spell data, cooldowns, or other relevant attributes. The method returns
    true if the objects are not equal and false if they are equal. This operator is
    commonly used in conditional statements or when storing spell history objects
    in containers where equality comparisons are needed.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The PassiveSpellHistory object to compare against this instance.
      This parameter represents the right-hand side of the inequality comparison.
  returns: Returns true if the two PassiveSpellHistory objects are not equal, false
    otherwise. The comparison is based on the internal state or data members of both
    objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check
    code: "PassiveSpellHistory history1;\nPassiveSpellHistory history2;\n\n// Assuming\
      \ some initialization\nif (history1 != history2) {\n    // Handle the case where\
      \ histories are different\n    std::cout << \"Histories are not equal\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"Histories are equal\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in container operations
    code: "std::vector<PassiveSpellHistory> spellHistories;\nPassiveSpellHistory newHistory;\n\
      \n// Add history if it's not already present\nif (std::find(spellHistories.begin(),\
      \ spellHistories.end(), newHistory) == spellHistories.end()) {\n    spellHistories.push_back(newHistory);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using a member-wise comparison of
    the object's data members. The performance of this operation depends on how many
    data members are being compared and their complexity. Since this is a const method,
    it does not modify either object during the comparison.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on object inequality for logic decisions in high-frequency
    systems, as repeated comparisons may impact performance. Ensure that all relevant
    data members are properly compared to avoid false negatives in equality checks.
