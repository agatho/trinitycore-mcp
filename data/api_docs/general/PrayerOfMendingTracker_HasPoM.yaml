documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has a Prayer of Mending effect active.
  description: The HasPoM method determines whether a specific player currently has
    the Prayer of Mending spell effect applied to them. This method is typically used
    within the context of TrinityCore's spell system to track active buffs and their
    durations. It checks the internal tracking structure maintained by the PrayerOfMendingTracker
    class to see if the specified GUID corresponds to a player with an active Prayer
    of Mending buff. The method does not modify any state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player identified by the given GUID has an active Prayer
    of Mending effect; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player Has Prayer of Mending
    code: "if (prayerTracker.HasPoM(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player has Prayer of Mending\
      \ active\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Player has Prayer of Mending active.\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Player does not have Prayer of Mending active\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Player does not have Prayer of Mending active.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking structures that are updated when
    Prayer of Mending is applied or removed from players. The GUID parameter should
    be a valid player identifier within the TrinityCore system. Performance is optimized
    for frequent checks as it uses a lookup mechanism.
