  class: Unit
  method: SetInitialPowerValue
  signature: void Unit::SetInitialPowerValue(int powerType)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the initial power value for a unit's specified power type.
  description: This method configures the starting power value for a Unit's specific
    power type, typically used during creature or player initialization. It ensures
    that the unit's power is set to a predetermined value before any gameplay interactions
    occur. The method operates on the unit's internal power tracking system and is
    commonly invoked during object creation or initialization phases.
  parameters:
  - name: powerType
    description: 'The power type to initialize (e.g., mana, rage, focus, energy).
      Valid values include: 0 (mana), 1 (rage), 2 (focus), 3 (energy).'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetInitialPowerValue(0); // Initialize mana

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = new Player;

      player->SetInitialPowerValue(3); // Initialize energy for player

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during initialization phase to ensure proper
    power state setup. It's typically used in conjunction with other initialization
    methods like SetMaxPowerValue or SetPowerValue.
  warnings: Improper usage can lead to incorrect power values, potentially affecting
    gameplay mechanics and combat behavior. Ensure the power type is valid before
    calling this method.
