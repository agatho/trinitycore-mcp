    const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two PointMovementParams objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a component-wise comparison of two PointMovementParams
    objects to determine if they are identical. It evaluates whether all member variables
    of the current object match those of the provided object. This comparison is typically
    used in pathfinding and movement logic within TrinityCore's AI system, where precise
    movement parameter matching is required for consistent behavior. The method returns
    true if all components are equal, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: The PointMovementParams object to compare against the current instance.
  returns: True if all member variables of both objects are equal; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two PointMovementParams objects
    code: 'PointMovementParams params1;

      PointMovementParams params2;

      bool isEqual = (params1 == params2); // Returns true if all members are identical'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using operator== in a conditional movement logic
    code: "PointMovementParams currentParams;\nPointMovementParams targetParams;\n\
      \nif (currentParams == targetParams)\n{\n    // Movement parameters match, proceed\
      \ with movement\n    player->MoveTo(targetParams.GetX(), targetParams.GetY(),\
      \ targetParams.GetZ());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Parameters differ, recalculate path\n\
      \    player->RecalculatePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is commonly used in AI decision-making processes where movement
    parameters need to be compared for consistency. The comparison includes all relevant
    fields such as position coordinates and movement flags, ensuring that only truly
    identical parameter sets return true.
