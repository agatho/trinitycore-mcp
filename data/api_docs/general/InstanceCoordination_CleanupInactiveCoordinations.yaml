documentation:
  brief: Removes inactive instance coordination entries from the system.
  description: The CleanupInactiveCoordinations method is responsible for removing
    stale or expired instance coordination data from the TrinityCore server's internal
    tracking structures. This method ensures that outdated coordination entries, which
    may no longer be relevant due to player disconnections, instance closures, or
    timeout conditions, are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks and maintain
    system performance. It typically runs periodically as part of the server's maintenance
    routines to keep the coordination state clean and efficient.

  - title: Basic Usage in Server Maintenance Loop
    code: "void ServerUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    sInstanceCoordination->CleanupInactiveCoordinations();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the server's periodic cleanup
    routines. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom coordination management logic. The cleanup process may involve checking
    for expired sessions, disconnected players, or closed instances before removing
    coordination entries.
