  signature: void GroupCoordination::HandleLeaderDisconnect()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the disconnection of a group leader by transferring leadership to
    another member.
  description: The HandleLeaderDisconnect method is responsible for managing the transition
    of group leadership when the current leader disconnects from the game. This method
    ensures that group coordination remains intact by automatically promoting the
    next eligible member to take over as leader. It typically triggers during player
    logout, server shutdown, or unexpected disconnection scenarios where a group leader
    is no longer available. The method evaluates group membership and selects an appropriate
    successor based on predefined criteria such as role, activity level, or seniority
    within the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during player logout
    code: "void Player::OnLogout()\n{\n    // ... other cleanup code ...\n    sGroupCoordination->HandleLeaderDisconnect();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the group management system
    and should not be called directly from external modules unless specifically required.
    It performs automatic leadership transfer without user intervention, which may
    affect group dynamics and quest progression in certain scenarios.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method in custom scripts or modifications,
    as improper handling can lead to unintended group leadership changes. Ensure that
    all group members are properly notified of the leadership change for smooth gameplay
    experience.
