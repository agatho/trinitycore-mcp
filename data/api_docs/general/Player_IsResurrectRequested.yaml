documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has been requested for resurrection.
  description: This method determines if a player is currently in the process of being
    resurrected, typically through a resurrection spell or similar mechanism. It returns
    true when the player's resurrection request status is active, indicating that
    they are awaiting resurrection or have already been resurrected by another player.
    The method is commonly used in game mechanics related to player death and resurrection
    states, particularly in PvP scenarios or when a player is being resurrected by
    a priest or other player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has been requested for resurrection, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player's resurrection request status is active, which
    may occur during a resurrection spell casting or after being resurrected by another
    player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsResurrectRequested()) {\n    // Player is currently being\
      \ resurrected\n    // Do something with the player\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resurrection-related
    methods like GetResurrectionState or IsDead. The implementation relies on internal
    game state tracking and may be affected by server-side logic for handling resurrection
    requests.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with IsDead, which returns true when
    a player is dead but not necessarily resurrected. It's important to understand
    that the player may be in a resurrection state even if they are not yet fully
    resurrected or have been resurrected by another player.
