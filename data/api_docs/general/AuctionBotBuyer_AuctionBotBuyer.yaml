  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AuctionBotBuyer class for managing auction
    house bidding behavior.
  description: The AuctionBotBuyer constructor initializes a new instance of the AuctionBotBuyer
    class, which is responsible for handling automated bidding on the auction house.
    This class manages bid placement, price calculations, and auction monitoring for
    the auction bot system. The constructor sets up internal data structures and configuration
    parameters needed to perform automated purchasing actions within the game's auction
    house mechanics. It prepares the object for use in the auction bot framework without
    requiring additional setup or initialization calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AuctionBotBuyer instance
    code: 'AuctionBotBuyer* buyer = new AuctionBotBuyer();

      // The buyer object is now ready to manage auction bidding operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any network communication or database access.
    It only initializes internal state variables and configuration settings. The actual
    auction bidding functionality requires additional setup including proper configuration
    loading and active auction house connection.
  warnings: Do not use this constructor directly in a multithreaded environment without
    proper synchronization. The AuctionBotBuyer class is designed to be used as part
    of the larger auction bot system, and direct instantiation may lead to unexpected
    behavior if not properly integrated with the game's auction house subsystem.
