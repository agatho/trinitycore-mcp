  class: CreatureStaticFlagsHolder
  method: GetFlags6
  signature: int CreatureStaticFlagsHolder::GetFlags6() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the sixth set of static flags associated with a creature.
  description: The GetFlags6 method returns an integer value representing the sixth
    group of static flags stored within the CreatureStaticFlagsHolder class. These
    flags are typically used to define specific behavioral or visual properties of
    creatures in the World of Warcraft environment, such as whether they are selectable,
    immune to certain effects, or have special AI behaviors. The returned value is
    a bitmask that can be combined with other flag values using bitwise operations
    to determine the complete set of creature properties. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is safe for repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the sixth set of static flags for the creature.
    Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific flag, allowing bitwise
    checks to determine individual property states.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a creature has a specific flag
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder* flagsHolder = creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->GetStaticFlags();\n\
      int flags6 = flagsHolder->GetFlags6();\nif (flags6 & 0x10) // Check for a specific\
      \ flag\n{\n    // Creature has the special flag set\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger system that manages static creature properties.
    The flags are typically loaded from database entries and cached during server
    initialization. Developers should be aware that flag values may vary between different
    versions of TrinityCore or custom modifications.
