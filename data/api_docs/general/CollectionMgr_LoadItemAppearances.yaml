  method: LoadItemAppearances
  signature: void CollectionMgr::LoadItemAppearances()
documentation:
  brief: Loads item appearance data from the database into memory for use in the collection
    manager.
  description: The LoadItemAppearances method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures of the CollectionMgr class with item appearance information retrieved
    from the game database. This method is typically invoked during server startup
    or when the collection system needs to refresh its cached item appearance data.
    It ensures that all known item appearances are available for player collections,
    including cosmetic changes such as weapon skins, armor designs, and other visual
    modifications. The method performs database queries to fetch appearance records
    and processes them into an in-memory cache structure for fast lookup during gameplay
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeCollectionManager()\n{\n    CollectionMgr* collectionMgr\
      \ = sObjectAccessor->GetCollectionMgr();\n    if (collectionMgr)\n    {\n  \
      \      collectionMgr->LoadItemAppearances();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during server startup or database reload operations.
    It may block briefly while performing database queries and processing large datasets
    of item appearance records. The loaded data is cached in memory for fast access,
    so subsequent calls to related collection methods will be more efficient.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate data entries. Ensure that any existing cached data is
    properly cleared before reloading.
