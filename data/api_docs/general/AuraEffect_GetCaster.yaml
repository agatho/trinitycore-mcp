  class: AuraEffect
  method: GetCaster
  signature: Unit * AuraEffect::GetCaster() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Unit that cast the aura effect.
  description: The GetCaster method retrieves the Unit object that originally applied
    the aura effect to a target. This is typically the caster of the spell that created
    the aura, which could be a player, creature, game object, or any other Unit subclass.
    The returned pointer may be null if the aura was applied without a valid caster,
    such as in certain scripted or temporary effects. In World of Warcraft terms,
    this corresponds to the 'caster' of an aura as tracked by the server-side aura
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit that cast the aura effect, or nullptr if no valid
    caster exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AuraEffect* auraEffect = unit->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_ID, EFFECT_INDEX);\n\
      if (auraEffect)\n{\n    Unit* caster = auraEffect->GetCaster();\n    if (caster)\n\
      \    {\n        // Process the caster\n        sLog->outString(\"Aura cast by:\
      \ %s\", caster->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Player Caster
    code: "AuraEffect* auraEffect = target->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_ID, EFFECT_INDEX);\n\
      if (auraEffect)\n{\n    Unit* caster = auraEffect->GetCaster();\n    if (caster\
      \ && caster->IsPlayer())\n    {\n        Player* playerCaster = caster->ToPlayer();\n\
      \        // Perform actions specific to player casters\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any reference counting or ownership checks.
    The returned Unit pointer is valid only as long as the aura effect and its caster
    are alive. If the caster dies or is removed from the world, the pointer may become
    invalid.
  warnings: Always check for null return values when calling GetCaster() to prevent
    dereferencing a nullptr. In some edge cases, especially with temporary or scripted
    auras, the caster might not be set, leading to a null result.
