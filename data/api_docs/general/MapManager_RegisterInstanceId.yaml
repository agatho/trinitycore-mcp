documentation:
  brief: Registers a new instance ID with the map manager for tracking and management
    purposes.
  description: The RegisterInstanceId method is used to register a new instance identifier
    within the MapManager system. This allows the game server to track and manage
    different instance worlds, ensuring proper handling of player instances, object
    placement, and world state synchronization. The method typically gets called when
    a new dungeon, raid, or scenario instance is created. It integrates with the broader
    instance management system to maintain consistency across the game world and ensure
    that each instance operates independently while still being properly tracked by
    the server.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Instance Registration
    code: "void CreateNewInstance()\n{\n    uint32 newInstanceId = sMapMgr->GenerateInstanceId();\n\
      \    sMapMgr->RegisterInstanceId(newInstanceId);\n    // Proceed with instance\
      \ setup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the instance creation process.
    Developers should not call this directly unless implementing custom instance management
    logic. The MapManager maintains an internal registry of all active instances,
    and this registration ensures proper tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper instance setup may lead to undefined
    behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that any instance ID being registered is valid
    and has been properly initialized before calling this method.
