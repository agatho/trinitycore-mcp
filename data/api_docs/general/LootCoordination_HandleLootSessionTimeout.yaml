  signature: void LootCoordination::HandleLootSessionTimeout(uint32 lootSessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the timeout of a loot session by cleaning up associated loot and
    notifying players.
  description: The HandleLootSessionTimeout method is responsible for managing the
    cleanup process when a loot session expires. It ensures that all items in the
    session are properly handled, removes the session from active tracking, and notifies
    participating players of the session's end. This method typically gets invoked
    automatically when a loot session times out due to inactivity or a predefined
    time limit. The method is crucial for maintaining proper game state and preventing
    orphaned loot items or invalid session references.
  parameters:
  - name: lootSessionId
    description: The unique identifier of the loot session that has timed out. This
      ID corresponds to an active loot session in the system, and is used to locate
      and process the associated loot data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: LootCoordination::HandleLootSessionTimeout(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Timeout Logic
    code: "void GameWorld::OnLootTimeout(uint32 sessionId)\n{\n    LootCoordination::HandleLootSessionTimeout(sessionId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called for valid, active loot sessions. It assumes
    that the session ID is already validated and exists in the system's active session
    list. The cleanup process may involve updating player loot lists, sending packets
    to clients, and removing internal references.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent lootSessionId can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure the session exists before
    calling this method. Additionally, this method modifies global state and should
    be used carefully in multi-threaded environments.
