  brief: Initializes the opcode whitelist for bot packet relay functionality
  description: The InitializeOpcodeWhitelist method sets up the list of allowed network
    opcodes that can be processed by the bot packet relay system. This method is typically
    called during system initialization to configure which client-to-server messages
    are permitted through the relay mechanism. The whitelist ensures that only specific,
    safe opcodes are forwarded to avoid potential security issues or protocol violations.
    This method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations,
    but it modifies internal state that affects how subsequent packet relaying operations
    behave.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BotPacketRelay relay;

      relay.InitializeOpcodeWhitelist();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. Subsequent
    calls may result in undefined behavior or duplicate entries in the internal opcode
    list. The implementation likely involves reading from configuration files or hardcoded
    values to populate the whitelist.
  warnings: Do not call this method after the bot packet relay system has started
    processing packets, as it may cause inconsistent state or security vulnerabilities.
    Ensure that all opcodes added to the whitelist are properly validated and safe
    for relay operations.
