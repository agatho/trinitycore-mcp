  method: LoadExplorationBaseXP
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadExplorationBaseXP()
documentation:
  brief: Loads base exploration experience values from the database into memory for
    use in calculating player quest and exploration rewards.
  description: The LoadExplorationBaseXP method initializes the internal data structures
    used by the ObjectMgr class to store base experience values associated with different
    levels of exploration in World of Warcraft. This method is typically called during
    server startup or database reload operations to ensure that the game engine has
    access to the correct base XP values for determining rewards when players explore
    new areas or complete exploration-based quests. The method retrieves data from
    the database tables containing exploration experience definitions and populates
    internal lookup structures for fast access during gameplay. It does not perform
    any validation on the loaded data, assuming the database contains valid entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    sObjectMgr->LoadExplorationBaseXP();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the core system during server
    initialization. It's important to ensure that the database tables containing exploration
    XP data are properly populated before calling this method, as missing or invalid
    entries could lead to incorrect experience calculations. The method uses thread-safe
    access patterns internally but should not be called concurrently from multiple
    threads.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are actively exploring areas may result
    in inconsistent experience reward calculations until the next reload cycle. Do
    not invoke this method during active gameplay sessions without proper synchronization
    mechanisms.
