  signature: void UpdateData::AddOutOfRangeGUID(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a GUID to the list of out-of-range objects in the update data.
  description: The AddOutOfRangeGUID method is used to register a GameObject or Unit's
    GUID as being outside the client's update range. This is an internal mechanism
    within TrinityCore's update system that helps manage which objects should be removed
    from a player's client view when they move out of proximity. The method typically
    gets called during world object updates and is part of the broader UpdateData
    class functionality that prepares data for sending to clients. It ensures that
    objects that are no longer in range are properly marked for removal, preventing
    unnecessary network traffic and maintaining performance.

    code: 'UpdateData updateData;

      // Assume we''re processing a GameObject that has moved out of range

      int guid = 12345;

      updateData.AddOutOfRangeGUID(guid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core update loop and should
    not usually be called directly from game logic. The UpdateData class manages both
    in-range and out-of-range GUIDs separately to optimize network packet construction.
