  signature: bool DispelCoordinator::IsHealer(Unit * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified unit is classified as a healer in the context
    of dispel coordination.
  description: The IsHealer method evaluates whether a given Unit object is categorized
    as a healer within the DispelCoordinator's logic. This classification is typically
    used to determine which units should be prioritized for healing-based dispels
    or to exclude them from certain dispel operations. The method likely checks the
    unit's role, class, or spell capabilities to make this determination. It is commonly
    used in group-based dispel strategies where healers may require different handling
    than damage dealers or tanks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is classified as a healer; otherwise returns false.
    This boolean value indicates whether the unit should be treated according to healer-specific
    dispel rules or logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dispel logic
    code: "if (dispelCoordinator.IsHealer(targetUnit)) {\n    // Handle healer specially,\
      \ e.g., skip certain dispels\n    continue;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with dispel decision making
    code: "void DispelCoordinator::ProcessDispelList(std::vector<Unit*>& targets)\
      \ {\n    for (Unit* target : targets) {\n        if (!IsHealer(target)) {\n\
      \            // Proceed with normal dispel logic\n            DoDispel(target);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other dispel coordination
    logic to optimize group dispel efficiency. The exact criteria for healer classification
    may depend on the unit's class, role assignment, or spellbook composition.
