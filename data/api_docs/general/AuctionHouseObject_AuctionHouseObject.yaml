  brief: Moves an auction house object to a new location using move semantics.
  description: The AuctionHouseObject constructor that accepts an rvalue reference
    serves as a move constructor. It transfers ownership of resources from the source
    object to the newly constructed object, effectively relocating the auction house
    instance. This is a standard C++ move semantics implementation that optimizes
    resource management by avoiding unnecessary copying. In the context of TrinityCore's
    auction system, this method likely handles the efficient transfer of auction data
    structures when creating new auction house instances or reassigning existing ones.
    The operation should be performed only when the source object is no longer needed,
    as its state becomes undefined after the move.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing AuctionHouseObject
    code: 'AuctionHouseObject* source = new AuctionHouseObject();

      AuctionHouseObject movedObject = std::move(*source);

      // ''source'' is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // ''movedObject'' contains the auction house data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor follows standard move semantics. After calling this constructor,
    the source object should not be used as its internal state becomes undefined.
    The implementation assumes that the source object's resources can be safely transferred
    without side effects.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after moving from it. This is a fundamental
    rule of move semantics in C++. Attempting to access members of the moved-from
    object results in undefined behavior.
