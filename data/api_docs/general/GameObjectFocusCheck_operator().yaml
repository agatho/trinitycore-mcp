documentation:
  brief: Checks if a game object meets focus criteria for interaction or targeting.
  description: The GameObjectFocusCheck::operator() method evaluates whether a given
    game object satisfies specific focus conditions required for interaction or targeting
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used in AI behavior
    trees, target selection logic, or quest-related systems where only certain types
    of game objects should be considered as valid targets. The method takes a pointer
    to an integer representing the game object's identifier and returns true if the
    object meets the defined focus criteria, false otherwise. It is commonly invoked
    during game object validation processes to ensure that only appropriate objects
    are processed for player interaction or AI decision-making.
  parameters:
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the game object's identifier (GUID).
      This parameter must point to a valid game object in the world, otherwise behavior
      is undefined.
  returns: Returns true if the game object pointed to by 'go' meets the focus criteria
    for interaction or targeting; returns false otherwise. The method does not distinguish
    between different types of focus failure, only that the object failed to meet
    requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in target selection
    code: "GameObjectFocusCheck checker;\nint gameObjectId = 12345;\nbool isValidTarget\
      \ = checker(&gameObjectId);\nif (isValidTarget) {\n    // Proceed with interaction\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision making
    code: "class MyAIComponent {\npublic:\n    bool SelectValidTarget(std::vector<int>&\
      \ targets) {\n        GameObjectFocusCheck focusChecker;\n        for (int&\
      \ targetId : targets) {\n            if (focusChecker(&targetId)) {\n      \
      \          // Found a valid target\n                return true;\n         \
      \   }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a functor pattern used in TrinityCore's AI
    and targeting systems. It may perform checks such as object type validation, visibility
    conditions, or state-based filtering. The implementation assumes that the integer
    pointed to by 'go' represents a valid game object GUID within the current world
    context.
  warnings: Ensure that the input pointer 'go' is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Additionally, verify
    that the integer value points to an existing game object in the world to avoid
    invalid memory access or incorrect validation results.
