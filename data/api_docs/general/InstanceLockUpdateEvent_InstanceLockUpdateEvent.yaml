  brief: Moves an InstanceLockUpdateEvent object, transferring its resources to another
    instance.
  description: The InstanceLockUpdateEvent constructor is a move constructor that
    transfers ownership of resources from one InstanceLockUpdateEvent object to another.
    This operation is typically used when moving objects within the TrinityCore framework,
    particularly in event handling and instance management systems. The move constructor
    ensures efficient resource management by avoiding unnecessary copying of data
    structures while maintaining the integrity of instance lock update events. This
    is especially relevant in World of Warcraft's instance locking mechanisms where
    events need to be efficiently passed between different system components without
    duplicating complex data.

  examples:
  - title: Move InstanceLockUpdateEvent to new variable
    code: 'InstanceLockUpdateEvent event1;

      // ... populate event1 with data ...

      InstanceLockUpdateEvent event2 = std::move(event1);

      // event1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // event2 contains the moved resources'
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor follows standard C++ move semantics. After the move
    operation, the source object (other) should not be used for any operations that
    require valid state, as it will be left in a valid but unspecified state. The
    implementation likely involves transferring pointers or handles rather than deep
    copying data structures to optimize performance.
  warnings: Using the moved object after this constructor call can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure no further operations are performed on the source object after
    moving. This is particularly important in event-driven systems where objects may
    be moved between different event handlers or contexts.
