  signature: float MovementValidator::GetSafeFallDistance(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the maximum safe falling distance for a player bot.
  description: The GetSafeFallDistance method determines the maximum vertical distance
    a player bot can fall without taking damage or experiencing undesirable game mechanics
    effects. This calculation considers various factors such as the bot's current
    state, equipped items, buffs, debuffs, and environmental conditions. The returned
    value represents the distance in yards that the bot can safely fall before landing
    on the ground or a surface that would cause harm. This method is typically used
    by AI systems to make decisions about movement, jumping, and pathfinding for player-controlled
    bots.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum safe falling distance in yards.
    The value is always non-negative and indicates how far the bot can fall without
    taking damage or experiencing negative consequences.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine safe fall distance
    code: "float safeDistance = validator.GetSafeFallDistance(bot);\nif (safeDistance\
      \ > 5.0f)\n{\n    // Bot can safely fall from a height greater than 5 yards\n\
      \    bot->SetCanFly(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using safe fall distance for AI decision making
    code: "float safeDistance = validator.GetSafeFallDistance(bot);\nPosition currentPosition\
      \ = bot->GetPosition();\nPosition targetPosition = GetNextWaypoint();\nfloat\
      \ verticalDistance = currentPosition.GetZ() - targetPosition.GetZ();\n\nif (verticalDistance\
      \ > safeDistance)\n{\n    // Need to find an alternative path or use a flight\
      \ path\n    bot->SetCanFly(true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Safe to proceed with falling\
      \ or jumping\n    bot->MoveTo(targetPosition, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MovementValidator class which is designed for
    AI-driven movement calculations. The implementation likely accounts for player
    stats, gear, and game mechanics such as fall damage reduction effects. The returned
    value may vary based on the bot's current condition and equipped items.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided Player pointer is valid and not null.
    Using an invalid or uninitialized player reference will result in undefined behavior.
    Additionally, this calculation does not account for temporary environmental factors
    like weather conditions or dynamic terrain changes during runtime.
