documentation:
  brief: Adds a unit type mask to the unit's type mask.
  description: This method adds a specified unit type mask to the current unit's type
    mask, allowing for extended classification of unit types within the game. The
    method is typically used in conjunction with other unit type related functions
    to manage and modify the unit's classification. It operates on the principle that
    unit types are represented by bitmask values, enabling multiple types to be combined
    and stored in a single unit instance. This functionality is essential for handling
    complex unit interactions and behaviors within World of Warcraft's game mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->AddUnitTypeMask(UNIT_TYPE_HUMAN);

      // This adds the human unit type mask to the unit''s type mask'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on a bitmask system where each unit type has a specific
    value. It is important to note that this method does not replace existing masks
    but rather adds to them, allowing for multiple types to coexist in the unit's
    type mask. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple bitwise
    operation.
