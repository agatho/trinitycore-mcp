  class: SocialManager
  method: RecordFriendAdded
  signature: void SocialManager::RecordFriendAdded(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Records the addition of a friend to the player's social list.
  description: The RecordFriendAdded method is used to log or track when a player
    adds another player as a friend in the game's social system. This method likely
    updates internal data structures or database entries to reflect the new friendship
    relationship. It may also trigger notifications or synchronization events to ensure
    the social data is consistent across the game world. The method operates on the
    provided player GUID to identify which player added the friend, and it typically
    does not return any value as it's a void function.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is adding a friend.
      This value must be a valid player GUID within the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = sSocialMgr;

      socialMgr->RecordFriendAdded(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Login
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    // Record any pre-existing friends\
      \ during login\n    SocialManager* socialMgr = sSocialMgr;\n    socialMgr->RecordFriendAdded(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger social system implementation and may
    interact with database operations to persist friend relationships. It's important
    that the playerGuid parameter is validated before calling this function to avoid
    invalid data entries.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the player GUID could
    lead to data inconsistency or errors in the social subsystem. Ensure that the
    GUID corresponds to an actual logged-in player.
