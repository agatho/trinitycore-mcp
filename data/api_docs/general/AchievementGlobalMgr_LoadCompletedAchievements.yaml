  method: LoadCompletedAchievements
  signature: void AchievementGlobalMgr::LoadCompletedAchievements()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all completed achievements from the database into memory for global
    tracking and validation.
  description: The LoadCompletedAchievements method initializes the internal data
    structures of the AchievementGlobalMgr by retrieving all records of completed
    achievements from the game's database. This process ensures that the server maintains
    an accurate global record of which achievements have been earned by players across
    the entire realm. The method is typically invoked during server startup or when
    the achievement system requires a refresh of its global state. It does not return
    any value but updates internal caches and tracking mechanisms used for achievement
    validation, progression checks, and cross-player achievement comparisons.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeAchievementSystem()\n{\n    AchievementGlobalMgr::instance()->LoadCompletedAchievements();\n\
      \    // Achievement data is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query that may impact server startup time
    or performance if there are many completed achievements. It should only be called
    once during initialization or when a full refresh is required. The method assumes
    the database connection is already established and valid.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    duplicate entries in internal caches. Avoid invoking it during active gameplay
    sessions unless specifically needed for real-time updates.
