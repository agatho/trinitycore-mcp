  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void FuryWarriorRefactored::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the fury warrior's rotation based on the current target and combat
    state.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate combat rotation sequence for a Fury Warrior class character. This
    method evaluates the current target's health, available abilities, resource levels
    (such as rage), and other relevant combat conditions to decide which ability should
    be executed next in the rotation. It typically integrates with the AI system to
    ensure optimal damage output while maintaining proper resource management and
    cooldown tracking. The method is called regularly during combat to maintain an
    up-to-date rotation strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter determines the priority and selection of abilities based on target
      health, debuffs, and other combat factors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void FuryWarriorAI::Update()\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n        _warrior->UpdateRotation(me->GetVictim());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom AI Logic
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::UpdateRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Evaluate current combat\
      \ state and update rotation\n    if (me->GetRage() >= 10)\n        DoMeleeAttack(target);\n\
      \    else\n        DoAbilityRotation(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the AI update loop and should
    not be called directly unless in specific custom AI scenarios. The implementation
    may vary depending on the current specialization, talents, and gear of the warrior.
    Ensure that target validation is performed before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer dereferences.
  warnings: Calling UpdateRotation without a valid target or when the unit is not
    in combat can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect ability selection. Avoid
    recursive calls within this method as it may cause stack overflow issues.
