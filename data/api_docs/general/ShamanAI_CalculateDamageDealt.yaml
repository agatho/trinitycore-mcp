  signature: int ShamanAI::CalculateDamageDealt(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the total damage dealt by a Shaman AI unit to a target.
  description: The CalculateDamageDealt method computes the total damage output of
    a Shaman AI unit against a specified target. This method is typically used within
    the context of AI decision-making processes to evaluate offensive capabilities
    and determine optimal spell or ability usage. It considers various factors such
    as weapon damage, spell power, and any applicable modifiers or buffs that may
    affect the damage calculation. The method returns an integer value representing
    the calculated damage amount.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit against which damage is calculated. Must
      be a valid pointer to a Unit object, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: An integer representing the total calculated damage dealt to the target.
    Returns 0 if the target is invalid or no damage can be calculated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Damage Calculation
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // some valid unit\nint damage = shamanAI->CalculateDamageDealt(&target);\n\
      if (damage > 0) {\n    // Apply damage to target\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Damage in Combat Logic
    code: "Unit* target = player;\nint damage = shamanAI->CalculateDamageDealt(&target);\n\
      if (damage >= target->GetHealth()) {\n    // Target would be killed by this\
      \ attack\n    // Trigger special logic for kill\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Shaman AI subsystem and should only be called
    during active combat scenarios. The calculation may vary depending on current
    buffs, debuffs, and spell effects applied to both the shaman and the target.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid pointer for the target parameter will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate that the target is a
    valid Unit object before calling this method.
