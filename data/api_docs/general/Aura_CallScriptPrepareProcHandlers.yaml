  signature: bool Aura::CallScriptPrepareProcHandlers(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    ProcEventInfo & eventInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Invokes script handlers to prepare for proc events triggered by an aura application.
  description: The CallScriptPrepareProcHandlers method is responsible for executing
    any registered script handlers that are designed to prepare for proc events associated
    with a specific aura application. This method is typically called during the aura's
    processing cycle when a proc event is about to occur, allowing scripts to perform
    necessary setup or modifications before the actual proc logic is executed. It
    ensures that all procedural triggers related to the aura are properly initialized
    and ready for execution. The method returns true if any script handlers were successfully
    invoked, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial in TrinityCore's aura
    system where custom scripting can modify how auras behave during proc events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether any script handlers were successfully
    called. Returns true if at least one handler was executed, false if no handlers
    were invoked or if an error occurred during execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura proc handling
    code: "if (aura->CallScriptPrepareProcHandlers(auraApp, eventInfo)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with normal proc logic\n    aura->HandleProc(eventInfo);\n} else {\n\
      \    // No script handlers executed, proceed with default behavior\n    aura->HandleDefaultProc(eventInfo);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal aura processing pipeline and should not
    typically be called directly by external code. It is usually invoked automatically
    by the core aura management system when a proc event is detected. The method assumes
    that the aura application and event information are valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Improper handling of script handlers in this method can lead to unexpected
    behavior or crashes. Ensure all registered scripts are properly validated before
    execution. This method should not be used as a replacement for proper aura state
    management.
