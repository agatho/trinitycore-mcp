  method: GetModifiedManaCost
  signature: uint32 ArcaneChargeResource::GetModifiedManaCost(uint32 baseCost) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the modified mana cost for arcane charge-based abilities.
  description: The GetModifiedManaCost method adjusts the base mana cost of arcane
    charge-based spells or abilities based on the current state of arcane charges.
    This method is typically used in the context of spell systems where arcane charges
    affect resource consumption. It applies modifiers such as arcane charge multipliers,
    aura effects, or class-specific adjustments to determine the final mana cost that
    should be consumed when casting an ability. The calculation considers the player's
    current arcane charge state and any relevant buffs or debuffs that may alter the
    cost.
  parameters:
  - name: baseCost
    description: The original mana cost of the spell or ability before any modifications
      are applied.
  returns: Returns the adjusted mana cost as a uint32 value, which represents the
    actual amount of mana that will be consumed when the spell is cast, taking into
    account arcane charge modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell casting
    code: 'uint32 baseMana = 100;

      uint32 modifiedCost = arcaneChargeResource->GetModifiedManaCost(baseMana);

      player->ModifyMana(-modifiedCost); // Deduct the modified cost from player''s
      mana'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with spell effect calculation
    code: "SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nuint32 baseCost\
      \ = spellInfo->ManaCost;\nuint32 finalCost = arcaneChargeResource->GetModifiedManaCost(baseCost);\n\
      if (player->GetPower(POWER_MANA) >= finalCost)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell\
      \ casting\n    player->ModifyPower(POWER_MANA, -finalCost);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger arcane charge system that tracks player's
    arcane charges and applies appropriate cost modifications. The implementation
    may involve checking for active auras, class-specific abilities, or other game
    mechanics that influence mana consumption.
  warnings: Ensure that the baseCost parameter is valid before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior. This method should only be called when the arcane
    charge resource state is properly initialized and accessible.
