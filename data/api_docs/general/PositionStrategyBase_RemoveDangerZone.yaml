  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: RemoveDangerZone
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::RemoveDangerZone(const int & center)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified danger zone from the current position strategy.
  description: The RemoveDangerZone method removes a predefined danger zone centered
    at the given coordinate from the position strategy's internal list of dangerous
    areas. This is typically used in AI pathfinding or positioning logic to avoid
    areas that are considered hazardous for NPC movement or player safety. The method
    modifies the internal state of the PositionStrategyBase object by eliminating
    the specified danger zone, which may affect subsequent path calculations or positioning
    decisions. It is important to note that this operation does not validate whether
    the provided center coordinate actually corresponds to an existing danger zone,
    and calling this method with an invalid index may result in undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The integer identifier representing the center point of the danger
      zone to be removed. This value is typically used as an index or hash key to
      locate the specific danger zone within the strategy's internal data structures.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a Danger Zone by Center Coordinate
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase strategy;

      // Assume some danger zones have been added previously

      strategy.RemoveDangerZone(42); // Removes the danger zone centered at coordinate
      42'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state and should be used carefully
    in multi-threaded environments. The underlying implementation likely uses a container
    such as std::vector or std::set to store danger zones, and removal operations
    may have O(n) complexity depending on the chosen data structure.
  warnings: Calling RemoveDangerZone with an invalid center parameter (e.g., one that
    does not correspond to any existing danger zone) can lead to undefined behavior.
    Always ensure that the center coordinate refers to a valid danger zone before
    calling this method.
