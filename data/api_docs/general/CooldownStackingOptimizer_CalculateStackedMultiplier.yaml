  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: CalculateStackedMultiplier
  signature: float CooldownStackingOptimizer::CalculateStackedMultiplier(const int
    & cooldowns) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the stacked multiplier effect based on the number of active cooldowns.
  description: The CalculateStackedMultiplier method determines the cumulative multiplier
    applied to a specific game mechanic, such as damage or healing, when multiple
    cooldown effects are active simultaneously. This function is typically used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to compute stacking behavior for abilities
    that scale with the number of active cooldowns. The method takes an integer representing
    the count of active cooldowns and returns a floating-point multiplier value that
    reflects how much the effect should be amplified. It is commonly employed in systems
    where buffs or debuffs stack multiplicatively rather than additively, such as
    certain talent trees or class-specific mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: cooldowns
    description: An integer representing the number of active cooldown effects that
      contribute to the stacking multiplier. Valid values are typically non-negative
      integers, with 0 indicating no active cooldowns.
  returns: A floating-point value representing the cumulative multiplier effect from
    stacked cooldowns. A return value of 1.0 indicates no additional multiplier, while
    values greater than 1.0 indicate increased effectiveness due to stacking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      int activeCooldowns = 3;

      float multiplier = optimizer.CalculateStackedMultiplier(activeCooldowns);

      // Result: multiplier would be calculated based on the stacking rules for 3
      cooldowns'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Ability Effects
    code: "void ApplyAbilityEffect(Unit* caster, int cooldownCount) {\n    CooldownStackingOptimizer\
      \ optimizer;\n    float stackMultiplier = optimizer.CalculateStackedMultiplier(cooldownCount);\n\
      \    float baseDamage = 100.0f;\n    float finalDamage = baseDamage * stackMultiplier;\n\
      \    // Apply finalDamage to target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger cooldown management system and may
    be used in conjunction with other utility functions that track active cooldowns.
    The exact stacking formula (linear, exponential, or custom) is not specified here
    but would typically be defined within the class implementation. Performance-wise,
    this function should be lightweight as it's expected to be called frequently during
    combat calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the input parameter 'cooldowns' is properly validated to prevent
    unexpected behavior from negative values. The method assumes that cooldowns are
    counted in a consistent manner across all systems using it, so inconsistent counting
    may lead to incorrect multipliers.
