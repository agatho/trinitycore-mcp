  class: LootStore
  method: HaveQuestLootForPlayer
  signature: bool LootStore::HaveQuestLootForPlayer(uint32 loot_id, const Player *
    player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player has quest loot available in the specified loot store.
  description: The HaveQuestLootForPlayer method determines if a given player has
    any quest-related loot items available within a specific loot store. This functionality
    is crucial for determining which loot should be offered to players when they interact
    with game objects or NPCs that provide quest rewards. The method evaluates the
    player's quest status and available loot entries to decide whether there are valid
    quest items to be looted. It ensures that only appropriate quest rewards are presented
    to players based on their current quest progress and completion status.
  parameters:
  - name: loot_id
    description: The unique identifier of the loot store to check for quest loot availability.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose quest loot availability is being
      evaluated. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player has available quest loot in the specified loot
    store, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest loot availability
    code: "if (lootStore->HaveQuestLootForPlayer(12345, player)) {\n    // Player\
      \ has quest loot available\n    player->SendLoot(lootStore, LOOT_MODE_DEFAULT);\n\
      } else {\n    // No quest loot available for this player\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      No quest loot available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a quest reward system
    code: "void Player::OnQuestComplete(Quest const* quest) {\n    // Check if there's\
      \ quest loot for this specific loot store\n    if (sLootStore->HaveQuestLootForPlayer(quest->GetQuestId(),\
      \ this)) {\n        // Award quest loot\n        Loot loot;\n        loot.FillLoot(quest->GetQuestId(),\
      \ LOOT_TYPE_QUEST, this);\n        SendLoot(&loot, LOOT_MODE_DEFAULT);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest completion and loot
    distribution systems. The implementation likely involves checking the player's
    quest log and comparing it against the loot store entries to determine which items
    should be available for looting.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also note that this
    method only checks for quest loot specifically, not general loot items.
