documentation:
  brief: Analyzes gossip text to determine the appropriate interaction type for a
    player's dialogue with an NPC.
  description: The AnalyzeGossipText method processes the text content of a gossip
    interaction to identify and return the corresponding InteractionType. This method
    is used internally by the GossipHandler to route player actions based on the specific
    gossip options presented by NPCs. It evaluates the provided text string against
    predefined patterns or conditions to determine how the interaction should be handled,
    such as initiating a quest, opening a vendor interface, or displaying a custom
    message. The method does not modify any state and is purely analytical in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an InteractionType enum value that indicates the type of interaction
    determined from the gossip text. Possible values may include types such as QUEST_GREETING,
    VENDOR, TRAINER, or CUSTOM_MESSAGE depending on how the text matches predefined
    patterns within the gossip system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a gossip handler
    code: "InteractionType type = gossipHandler.AnalyzeGossipText(\"I want to buy\
      \ some goods.\");\nswitch (type) {\n    case InteractionType::VENDOR:\n    \
      \    // Handle vendor interaction\n        break;\n    case InteractionType::QUEST_GREETING:\n\
      \        // Handle quest greeting\n        break;\n    default:\n        //\
      \ Handle unknown interaction\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during gossip processing when a player selects
    an option from an NPC's dialogue menu. It assumes that the text parameter has
    already been sanitized and validated for proper formatting. The implementation
    likely uses pattern matching or lookup tables to determine interaction types,
    so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the input text is properly formatted and does not contain
    malicious content before passing it to this method. While the method itself is
    read-only, improper handling of the input string could lead to incorrect interaction
    routing or potential security vulnerabilities if not validated appropriately.
