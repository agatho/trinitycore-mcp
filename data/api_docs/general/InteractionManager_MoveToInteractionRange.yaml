    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a bot player toward the interaction range of a target object.
  description: The MoveToInteractionRange method attempts to move a player bot towards
    a specified target object until it reaches the appropriate interaction distance.
    This method is typically used in AI behavior systems where bots need to approach
    NPCs, game objects, or other players to perform interactions such as talking,
    looting, or engaging in combat. The method evaluates the current distance between
    the bot and the target, and if the distance exceeds the interaction range threshold,
    it initiates movement toward the target. It returns true upon successful initiation
    of movement or when the bot is already within range, and false if movement cannot
    be initiated due to invalid parameters or navigation issues.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that needs to move
      towards the target.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that represents the target the bot should
      move toward. This can be an NPC, GameObject, or another Player.
  returns: Returns true if the bot successfully begins moving toward the target or
    is already within interaction range; returns false if movement cannot be initiated
    due to invalid parameters, navigation failure, or other issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MoveToInteractionRange
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nWorldObject* target = ...;\nif (interactionManager->MoveToInteractionRange(bot,\
      \ target)) {\n    // Bot is moving or already in range\n} else {\n    // Movement\
      \ failed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using MoveToInteractionRange in AI logic
    code: "void BotAI::Update() {\n    Player* bot = GetBot();\n    if (Unit* target\
      \ = GetTarget()) {\n        if (!interactionManager->MoveToInteractionRange(bot,\
      \ target)) {\n            // Handle movement failure\n            SetState(BotState::FAILED);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's navigation system to calculate and execute
    movement paths. It may not work correctly if the target is unreachable or if the
    bot's movement is blocked by terrain or other obstacles. The interaction range
    is determined by the game's internal settings and may vary depending on the type
    of target object.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and target pointers are valid before calling
    this method, as passing null pointers can lead to undefined behavior. Also, be
    aware that continuous calls to this method without checking for completion might
    cause performance issues or unintended movement loops.
