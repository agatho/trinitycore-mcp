documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new BotActionResult instance indicating successful
    completion of a bot action.
  description: The Success method is a static factory method that constructs and returns
    a BotActionResult object representing a successful outcome. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore bot framework to signal that an AI-controlled bot
    has completed an action without errors. The returned object can be used to communicate
    success status back to calling code, enabling proper flow control and decision-making
    in bot behavior logic. It's commonly employed in bot action handlers where a successful
    operation needs to be reported to the parent system or subsequent action sequencer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotActionResult object initialized to represent a successful operation
    state. The returned instance should be checked for validity before use, and its
    properties should be examined to determine specific success details if needed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Action Handler
    code: "class MyBotAction {\npublic:\n    BotActionResult Execute() {\n       \
      \ // Perform some bot action\n        bool success = DoSomething();\n      \
      \  \n        if (success) {\n            return BotActionResult::Success();\n\
      \        }\n        \n        return BotActionResult::Failure(\"Operation failed\"\
      );\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Success Result in Action Chain
    code: "BotActionResult result = bot->MoveToTarget();\nif (result.Success()) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with next action\n    BotActionResult nextResult = bot->AttackTarget();\n\
      \    if (nextResult.Success()) {\n        return BotActionResult::Success();\n\
      \    }\n}\nreturn result;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a static method that returns a new BotActionResult instance each
    time it's called. The implementation likely uses default initialization for success
    states, but the exact internal representation depends on how the BotActionResult
    class is designed. Developers should not assume any specific internal state beyond
    the success indicator.
  warnings: Ensure proper handling of return values from this method - while it returns
    a valid object, calling code must still verify that the operation actually succeeded
    rather than just checking if the return value itself is non-null. The method does
    not perform any validation or error checking on its own.
