  class: CooldownEventBus
  method: SubscribeAll
  signature: bool CooldownEventBus::SubscribeAll(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all cooldown events in the CooldownEventBus.
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a given BotAI instance to receive
    notifications for all cooldown-related events within the CooldownEventBus. This
    allows the bot to react to various cooldown states, such as when abilities become
    available or when cooldowns are reduced. The method typically returns true if
    the subscription was successful and false otherwise. It is commonly used in AI
    scripting to ensure that bots are notified of relevant cooldown changes without
    having to manually subscribe to individual events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotAI subscriber was successfully added to all cooldown
    event listeners; otherwise, returns false if the subscription failed or if the
    subscriber was already registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Subscription Example
    code: "BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();\nbool success = CooldownEventBus::SubscribeAll(myBot);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot is now subscribed to all cooldown events\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely manages internal event listener lists and may involve
    thread synchronization depending on how the CooldownEventBus is implemented. Ensure
    that the BotAI instance remains valid for the duration of its subscription.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times with the same BotAI instance may lead
    to duplicate subscriptions or undefined behavior. Always verify the return value
    to confirm successful registration.
