  class: DefensiveManager
  method: NeedsEmergencyDefensive
  signature: bool DefensiveManager::NeedsEmergencyDefensive()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the defensive manager should initiate an emergency defensive
    action.
  description: The NeedsEmergencyDefensive method evaluates the current state of the
    defensive manager to determine if an urgent defensive measure is required. This
    typically involves checking health levels, threat assessments, or other combat-related
    conditions that would trigger an immediate defensive response. The method is commonly
    used in AI decision-making processes for NPCs or player characters to ensure timely
    reactions to dangerous situations. It serves as a predicate function that returns
    true when emergency defensive actions should be considered.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the defensive manager determines that an emergency defensive
    action is needed, false otherwise. The return value indicates whether the system
    should prioritize defensive measures over other behaviors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (defensiveManager.NeedsEmergencyDefensive()) {\n    // Initiate emergency\
      \ defensive actions\n    unit->CastSpell(unit, EMERGENCY_DEFENSIVE_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles or combat state checks.
    It may involve performance-sensitive calculations and should be used judiciously
    in frequently executed code paths. The implementation likely considers factors
    such as current health percentage, incoming threat level, and available defensive
    cooldowns.
  warnings: The method's behavior might change based on the specific implementation
    details of the defensive manager class. Ensure that emergency defensive actions
    are properly synchronized with other AI behaviors to avoid conflicting actions
    or race conditions during combat scenarios.
