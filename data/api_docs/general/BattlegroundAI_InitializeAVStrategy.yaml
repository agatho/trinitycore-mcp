  signature: void BattlegroundAI::InitializeAVStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the Alterac Valley strategy for the battleground AI.
  description: The InitializeAVStrategy method sets up the strategic behavior and
    objectives specific to the Alterac Valley battleground type. This method configures
    the AI's approach to capturing objectives, managing resources, and coordinating
    with team members during AV matches. It typically initializes internal state variables,
    sets up objective tracking systems, and prepares the AI for the unique mechanics
    of Alterac Valley such as tower and graveyard captures. The method is usually
    called during battleground initialization or when the AI needs to reset its strategy
    for a new match.

  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground Initialization
    code: "void MyBattleground::HandlePlayerJoin(Player* player)\n{\n    if (GetBgType()\
      \ == BATTLEGROUND_AV)\n    {\n        m_bgAI->InitializeAVStrategy();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during battleground setup,
    but may also be called manually when resetting AI behavior. The method assumes
    that the battleground type has been properly identified as Alterac Valley before
    execution.
