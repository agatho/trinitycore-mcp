  class: PathGenerator
  method: BuildShortcut
  signature: void PathGenerator::BuildShortcut()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and applies the most efficient path between two points in the
    game world, optimizing for minimal distance and valid navigation.
  description: 'The BuildShortcut method computes a direct or optimized path between
    the current position and a target location within the game world. It evaluates
    the navigation mesh to determine the shortest viable route while respecting terrain,
    obstacles, and other environmental constraints. This method is typically invoked
    during AI movement processing or player pathfinding operations to ensure characters
    move efficiently through the game environment. The computed path is stored internally
    for subsequent use in movement execution. Precondition: The PathGenerator must
    have a valid start position and target set. Postcondition: The internal path buffer
    contains the optimized route, ready for execution by the movement system.'

  - title: Basic Path Generation
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.SetStart(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      pathGen.SetTarget(500.0f, 600.0f, 700.0f);

      pathGen.BuildShortcut();

      // Path is now computed and ready for movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs pathfinding calculations using the game's navigation
    mesh system. It may block briefly during complex terrain evaluation. The resulting
    path is optimized for directness but not necessarily for smoothness or adherence
    to specific movement constraints like climbing or swimming.
  warnings: Calling BuildShortcut without setting valid start and target positions
    will result in undefined behavior or empty paths. This method should not be called
    repeatedly in tight loops as it may impact performance during intensive AI processing.
