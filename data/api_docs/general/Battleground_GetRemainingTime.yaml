  class: Battleground
  method: GetRemainingTime
  signature: int Battleground::GetRemainingTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in seconds for the battleground match.
  description: The GetRemainingTime method retrieves the amount of time left in seconds
    until the current battleground match ends. This value is typically used to display
    countdown timers to players, determine when reinforcements arrive, or manage game
    state transitions. The returned value represents the time remaining from the start
    of the battleground's active phase, not including any pre-match or post-match
    periods. The method is const and safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of seconds remaining in the battleground
    match. Returns 0 if the match has ended or if no match is currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Display remaining time to players
    code: "void SendRemainingTimeToPlayers(Battleground* bg)\n{\n    int timeLeft\
      \ = bg->GetRemainingTime();\n    if (timeLeft > 0)\n    {\n        ChatHandler(bg->GetPlayers().begin()->second)->SendSysMessage(\"\
      Time remaining: \" + std::to_string(timeLeft) + \" seconds.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if time is running out
    code: "void CheckForTimeOut(Battleground* bg)\n{\n    int timeLeft = bg->GetRemainingTime();\n\
      \    if (timeLeft <= 30 && timeLeft > 0)\n    {\n        // Send warning message\n\
      \        bg->SendPacketToAll(new WorldPacket(SMSG_BATTLEGROUND_WAIT_TIME, 4));\n\
      \    }\n    else if (timeLeft == 0)\n    {\n        // Handle match end logic\n\
      \        bg->EndBattleground(RESULT_TIMEOUT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal battleground timers that are managed by the
    game server. The returned value updates dynamically as time passes and is affected
    by game mechanics such as player disconnections or match start delays. It's recommended
    to cache this value only for short periods to avoid stale data.
  warnings: Do not use this method to determine if a battleground is active; instead,
    check the battleground state using IsArena() or GetStatus(). Calling this method
    on a non-active battleground may return unexpected values or zero.
