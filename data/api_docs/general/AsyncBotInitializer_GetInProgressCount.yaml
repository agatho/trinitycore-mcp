documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of asynchronous bot initialization operations currently
    in progress
  description: The GetInProgressCount method provides a snapshot of the number of
    bot initialization tasks that are currently active or pending completion within
    the AsyncBotInitializer system. This counter reflects the concurrent workload
    of background initialization processes, which may include loading bot configurations,
    establishing connections, or performing other setup operations. The method is
    typically used for monitoring and debugging purposes to understand the current
    load on the bot initialization subsystem. It's important to note that this count
    represents a momentary state and may change rapidly as initialization tasks complete
    or new ones begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the number of active asynchronous bot initialization
    operations currently being processed by the system
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Initialization Load
    code: "AsyncBotInitializer* initializer = AsyncBotInitializer::GetSingleton();\n\
      size_t inProgress = initializer->GetInProgressCount();\nif (inProgress > 10)\n\
      {\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"High bot initialization load: %zu\
      \ operations in progress\", inProgress);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned count may fluctuate rapidly as initialization tasks are completed or
    new ones are queued, so it should be used for approximate monitoring rather than
    precise synchronization.
