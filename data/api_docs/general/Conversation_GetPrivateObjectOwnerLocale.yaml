  class: Conversation
  method: GetPrivateObjectOwnerLocale
  signature: int Conversation::GetPrivateObjectOwnerLocale() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the locale identifier of the private object owner in a conversation.
  description: The GetPrivateObjectOwnerLocale method returns an integer representing
    the locale setting of the player who owns the private object associated with this
    conversation. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's quest and dialogue
    systems where conversations are tied to specific player locales for localized
    content delivery. The returned value corresponds to the standard locale identifiers
    used by the game client, such as 0 for enUS, 1 for koKR, etc. This method does
    not modify any state and is safe to call during conversation processing or event
    handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the locale identifier of the private object owner.
    Common values include 0 (enUS), 1 (koKR), 2 (frFR), 3 (deDE), 4 (zhCN), 5 (zhTW),
    6 (esES), 7 (esMX), 8 (ruRU). Returns -1 if the private object owner is not set
    or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check conversation owner's locale
    code: "void CheckConversationLocale(Conversation* conv)\n{\n    int locale = conv->GetPrivateObjectOwnerLocale();\n\
      \    if (locale >= 0)\n    {\n        // Process locale-specific dialogue\n\
      \        switch (locale)\n        {\n            case 0: // enUS\n         \
      \       // Handle English dialogue\n                break;\n            case\
      \ 4: // zhCN\n                // Handle Chinese dialogue\n                break;\n\
      \            default:\n                // Default handling\n               \
      \ break;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the conversation has a valid private object owner
    set. If no owner exists, it may return -1 or undefined behavior depending on implementation
    details. The locale value returned should match the client's expected format for
    proper localization handling.
  warnings: Ensure that the conversation object is properly initialized before calling
    this method. Calling this on an uninitialized or destroyed conversation may result
    in undefined behavior or memory access violations.
