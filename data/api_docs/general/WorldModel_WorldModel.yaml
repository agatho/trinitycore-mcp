documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new WorldModel instance with default values and prepares it
    for use in the game world.
  description: The WorldModel constructor initializes a new instance of the WorldModel
    class, setting up internal data structures and default state variables required
    for representing in-game world models. This method is typically called when creating
    new world model objects that will be used to define terrain, buildings, or other
    environmental elements within the TrinityCore game world. The constructor ensures
    that all necessary memory is allocated and initialized properly before the object
    can be utilized by the game engine's rendering and collision systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new WorldModel instance
    code: 'WorldModel* model = new WorldModel();

      // The model is now initialized and ready for use in the world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs essential initialization of internal member variables
    and data structures. It should not be called directly in most cases as WorldModel
    instances are typically created through factory methods or resource managers within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of WorldModel objects should generally be avoided
    unless you understand the complete initialization process. Improper use may lead
    to undefined behavior or memory corruption in the game world system.
