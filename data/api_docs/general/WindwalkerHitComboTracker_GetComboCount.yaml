  class: WindwalkerHitComboTracker
  method: GetComboCount
  signature: uint32 WindwalkerHitComboTracker::GetComboCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current combo count from the WindwalkerHitComboTracker instance.
  description: The GetComboCount method returns the number of combo points currently
    accumulated by the WindwalkerHitComboTracker. This tracker is typically used in
    the context of Windwalker monk abilities and combo point mechanics within TrinityCore's
    combat system. The returned value represents how many combo points have been built
    up through successful hits or abilities, which can influence the effectiveness
    of subsequent actions such as special attacks or abilities that consume combo
    points. This method is read-only and does not modify any internal state of the
    tracker.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current number of combo points stored in
    the tracker. The value is typically between 0 and 5, though exact range may depend
    on game mechanics or specific implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'WindwalkerHitComboTracker tracker;

      uint32 comboCount = tracker.GetComboCount();

      // comboCount now holds the current number of combo points'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Combo Count in Logic
    code: "if (tracker.GetComboCount() >= 3) {\n    // Execute an ability that requires\
      \ at least 3 combo points\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_WINDWALKER_SERPENT_STRIKE,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const and safe to call from any thread context where the WindwalkerHitComboTracker
    instance is accessible. It should not be used for modifying combo point state;
    instead, use dedicated methods like AddComboPoint or RemoveComboPoint.
  warnings: Ensure that the WindwalkerHitComboTracker instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method. Accessing a destroyed or invalid tracker may result
    in undefined behavior.
