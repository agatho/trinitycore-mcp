documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the vignette entry has infinite area of interest.
  description: The IsInfiniteAOI method checks if a VignetteEntry object represents
    a vignette with an infinite area of interest. In World of Warcraft's context,
    vignettes are interactive elements such as quest markers or special events that
    may have different AOI (Area of Interest) behaviors. This flag typically indicates
    whether the vignette should be displayed or considered active regardless of player
    distance or location boundaries. The method returns true if the vignette has infinite
    AOI, meaning it is always relevant to the player's experience, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the vignette entry has infinite area of interest, indicating
    that the vignette should be active or visible regardless of distance or location
    constraints. Returns false if the vignette has a finite AOI and is only relevant
    within specific bounds.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a VignetteEntry has infinite AOI
    code: "VignetteEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetVignetteEntry(12345);\nif (entry\
      \ && entry->IsInfiniteAOI())\n{\n    // Handle infinite AOI vignette\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Vignette has infinite AOI\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in the client-server synchronization logic for
    vignettes, particularly in determining when to send updates or render elements.
    It's important to note that this flag may affect performance if not handled properly,
    especially in areas with many vignettes.
