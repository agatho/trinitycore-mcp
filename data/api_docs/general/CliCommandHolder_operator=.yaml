  class: CliCommandHolder
  method: operator=
  signature: CliCommandHolder & CliCommandHolder::operator=(const CliCommandHolder
    & right)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one CliCommandHolder object to another, performing
    a deep copy of its command data and associated metadata.
  description: The operator= method implements assignment semantics for the CliCommandHolder
    class, allowing one instance to be assigned the contents of another. This operation
    performs a deep copy of all internal data members including command strings, help
    text, and access permissions. The method ensures that both the source and destination
    objects remain independent after assignment, preventing shared memory issues or
    dangling references. In the context of TrinityCore's command-line interface system,
    this operator is crucial for managing command definitions and their associated
    properties when dynamically loading or reconfiguring CLI commands at runtime.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The source CliCommandHolder object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance. This parameter must be a valid, initialized object.
  returns: A reference to the current CliCommandHolder instance (this) after the assignment
    has been completed. This allows for chaining of assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Operation
    code: 'CliCommandHolder cmd1;

      cmd1.SetCommand("test");

      cmd1.SetHelp("This is a test command.");


      CliCommandHolder cmd2 = cmd1; // Uses the assignment operator

      // Now cmd2 contains identical data to cmd1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Assignment Operations
    code: 'CliCommandHolder cmdA, cmdB, cmdC;

      cmdA.SetCommand("commandA");

      cmdB.SetCommand("commandB");

      cmdC.SetCommand("commandC");


      // Chaining assignments

      cmdA = cmdB = cmdC; // Assigns cmdC''s contents to cmdB, then to cmdA'
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely handles deep copying of dynamically allocated memory
    for command strings and help text. This method should be used carefully in performance-critical
    sections as it may involve memory allocation/deallocation operations. The assignment
    operator ensures proper cleanup of existing resources before copying new data.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large CliCommandHolder objects, as the deep
    copy operation may cause temporary memory spikes. Ensure that the source object
    remains valid throughout the assignment process to prevent undefined behavior.
