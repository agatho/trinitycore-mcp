documentation:
  brief: Sends a WorldPacket to all players within the OutdoorPvP area
  description: The BroadcastPacket method is used to transmit a WorldPacket to all
    connected players who are currently within the boundaries of the OutdoorPvP zone.
    This method is typically employed for sending updates, notifications, or game
    state changes that affect all players in the outdoor PvP area. The packet is sent
    directly to the clients without any filtering based on faction or other criteria,
    ensuring that all players in the zone receive the message simultaneously. This
    mechanism is crucial for maintaining synchronized gameplay experiences in outdoor
    PvP zones where real-time communication between server and client is essential.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A pointer to a WorldPacket object containing the data to be broadcasted
      to all players in the OutdoorPvP zone. The packet should be properly constructed
      with appropriate opcode and payload before being passed to this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a Custom Message Packet
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_MESSAGE_CHAT, 100);

      packet << uint8(CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM);

      packet << uint32(0);

      packet << "Outdoor PvP Event Activated!";


      outdoorPvP->BroadcastPacket(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Territory Capture Update
    code: 'WorldPacket updatePacket(SMSG_UPDATE_WORLD_STATE, 8);

      updatePacket << uint32(0x1234); // Territory ID

      updatePacket << uint32(1);   // New controlling faction (Alliance)


      outdoorPvP->BroadcastPacket(&updatePacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates synchronously and will block until all packets are sent
    to connected players. It's important to ensure that the WorldPacket passed to
    this method is valid and properly formatted, as invalid packets can cause client-side
    errors or disconnections. The method does not perform any filtering or validation
    on player presence - it broadcasts to everyone currently within the OutdoorPvP
    zone regardless of their faction or status.
  warnings: Avoid calling BroadcastPacket with large or frequently updated packets
    as this can lead to performance degradation and network congestion. Ensure that
    the packet data being broadcasted is appropriate for all players in the zone,
    as there's no mechanism to filter recipients based on player state or faction.
