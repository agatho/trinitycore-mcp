  brief: Processes a guild petition rename request from a player
  description: Handles the client-side packet sent when a player attempts to rename
    their guild using a petition. This method validates the petition signature and
    updates the guild's name in the database. The operation requires the player to
    have a valid petition with proper signatures and sufficient permissions to modify
    the guild name. The method ensures that the new guild name meets game requirements
    and is not already taken by another guild.

  - title: Basic petition rename handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandlePetitionRenameGuild(WorldPackets::Petition::PetitionRenameGuild&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Validate petition signature\n    if (!packet.PetitionId\
      \ || !packet.NewName.empty())\n        return;\n    \n    // Process guild rename\
      \ logic\n    // ... implementation details ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the petition system that allows players to legally
    change their guild's name through official channels. The method performs validation
    checks on both the petition data and the proposed guild name before committing
    changes to the database.
  warnings: Improper handling of petition signatures can lead to unauthorized guild
    name changes. Always validate that the petition belongs to the requesting player
    and contains valid signatures before processing.
