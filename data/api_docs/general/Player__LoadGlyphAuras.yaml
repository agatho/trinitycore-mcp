documentation:
  brief: Loads glyph auras for the player character, enabling the application of glyph
    effects to the player's abilities.
  description: This method initializes and loads all glyph auras associated with the
    player's character, allowing the system to properly apply glyph effects to various
    abilities and skills. It is typically invoked during player initialization or
    when glyphs are updated, ensuring that the player's glyph system functions correctly.
    The method handles the loading of glyph-related auras from database storage, which
    may include various passive effects that modify character abilities. This process
    is essential for maintaining proper gameplay balance and ensuring that players
    can utilize their glyph investments effectively.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during player initialization or when glyph
    updates occur. It's important to note that the method does not directly apply
    glyphs to abilities; instead, it loads the necessary aura information for later
    application. The implementation may involve database queries and caching mechanisms.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method can lead to incorrect glyph effects
    being applied to player abilities, potentially causing gameplay imbalance or character
    performance issues. This method should never be called during active gameplay
    unless specifically required by game mechanics.
