  signature: bool Player::HasSummonPending() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has a pending summon request.
  description: This method determines whether the player currently has an active summon
    request that is pending completion. It typically checks for the presence of a
    summoning spell or event that has not yet been executed, such as a resurrection
    spell or summoning event. The method returns true if there is a pending summon
    request, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for managing player state
    during resurrection events and summoning mechanics in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has a pending summon request, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether a summon event is currently active or pending
    execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->HasSummonPending()) {\n    // Handle pending summon\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks internal player state
    flags or spell cooldowns related to summoning mechanics. Performance considerations:
    The method should be fast and not involve complex operations as it''s called frequently
    during gameplay. Thread safety: This method is generally safe for use in single-threaded
    contexts, but may require synchronization in multi-threaded scenarios.'
  warnings: This method may return false even when a player has a pending summon request
    if the summoning event hasn't been fully processed yet. Care should be taken to
    avoid relying on this method alone for determining player state during resurrection
    events.
