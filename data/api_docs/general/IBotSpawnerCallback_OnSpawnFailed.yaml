  signature: void IBotSpawnerCallback::OnSpawnFailed(const int & request, const int
    & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies when a bot spawn request fails with a specific reason code
  description: 'The OnSpawnFailed method is invoked by the bot spawner system when
    a request to spawn a bot has been rejected or encountered an error during execution.
    This callback allows developers to handle failed spawn attempts gracefully, logging
    errors, retrying spawn requests, or adjusting bot behavior based on the failure
    reason. The method is part of the IBotSpawnerCallback interface and is typically
    used in conjunction with bot management systems within TrinityCore''s AI framework.
    It provides two key parameters: the request identifier that failed and a reason
    code indicating why the spawn failed.'
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific bot spawn request
      that failed. This value uniquely identifies the request within the system for
      tracking purposes.
  - name: reason
    description: 'An integer code indicating the reason for the spawn failure. Possible
      values may include: 0 = Unknown error, 1 = Invalid parameters, 2 = Resource
      limit exceeded, 3 = Map not available, etc., depending on implementation details.'
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Implementation of OnSpawnFailed
    code: "class MyBotSpawnerCallback : public IBotSpawnerCallback {\npublic:\n  \
      \  void OnSpawnFailed(const int& request, const int& reason) override {\n  \
      \      std::cout << \"Spawn request \" << request << \" failed with reason code\
      \ \" << reason << std::endl;\n        // Handle the failure (log, retry, notify\
      \ user, etc.)\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Reason-Based Handling
    code: "class AdvancedBotSpawnerCallback : public IBotSpawnerCallback {\npublic:\n\
      \    void OnSpawnFailed(const int& request, const int& reason) override {\n\
      \        switch (reason) {\n            case 1: // Invalid parameters\n    \
      \            LogError(\"Invalid spawn parameters for request \" + std::to_string(request));\n\
      \                break;\n            case 2: // Resource limit exceeded\n  \
      \              LogWarning(\"Resource limit reached for request \" + std::to_string(request));\n\
      \                ScheduleRetry(request);\n                break;\n         \
      \   default:\n                LogError(\"Unexpected spawn failure for request\
      \ \" + std::to_string(request) + \", reason: \" + std::to_string(reason));\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is part of an asynchronous callback system and should not block
    execution. It's recommended to avoid heavy computations or database operations
    directly in this handler. The request identifier can be used to correlate with
    internal tracking systems for debugging purposes.
  warnings: Do not perform long-running operations inside this method as it may block
    the main thread. Ensure that any logging or error handling does not introduce
    performance bottlenecks. The reason codes are implementation-specific and may
    vary between different versions of TrinityCore.
