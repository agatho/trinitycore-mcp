  brief: Applies buffs to the Mage baseline rotation bot.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for applying necessary buffs to
    a Mage baseline rotation AI bot. This method typically handles the logic for determining
    which buffs should be applied based on the current game state, available mana,
    and combat conditions. It ensures that the bot maintains optimal performance by
    managing buff application timing and priority. The method operates within the
    context of the Mage's baseline rotation strategy, ensuring that essential buffs
    like Arcane Brilliance, Frost Armor, or other relevant auras are properly maintained.
