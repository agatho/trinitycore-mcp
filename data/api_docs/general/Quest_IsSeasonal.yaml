  brief: Determines whether the quest is seasonal.
  description: This method checks if a quest is designated as seasonal, meaning it
    is only available during specific times of the year or season. It returns true
    if the quest has seasonal restrictions and false otherwise. The method is commonly
    used in quest scripts and game mechanics to determine seasonal availability and
    to handle seasonal events such as holiday quests or seasonal content. This functionality
    helps ensure proper quest handling during seasonal periods.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is seasonal, false otherwise. A seasonal quest
    typically has restrictions that prevent it from being available outside of specific
    seasonal periods.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsSeasonal()) {\n    // Handle seasonal quest logic\n}"

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine seasonal availability. It may be used in quest scripts or event handlers
    to ensure proper handling of seasonal content.
  warnings: This method does not directly affect quest completion or progression,
    but it is important for determining whether a quest should be available during
    certain seasons. Misusing this method could lead to incorrect quest handling during
    seasonal events.
