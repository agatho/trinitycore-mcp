  class: ArenaAI
  method: GetGlobalMetrics
  signature: const ArenaMetrics & ArenaAI::GetGlobalMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the global arena metrics object used for
    tracking and managing arena-related statistics and data.
  description: The GetGlobalMetrics method provides access to a shared ArenaMetrics
    instance that holds aggregate statistics and data related to arena gameplay. This
    includes information such as match outcomes, player performance indicators, and
    overall arena activity metrics. The returned reference is constant, ensuring that
    the metrics cannot be modified through this interface. This method is typically
    used by AI systems or game logic components that need to analyze or respond to
    global arena conditions without altering the underlying data structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an ArenaMetrics object containing global arena
    statistics and gameplay data. The reference remains valid for the lifetime of
    the ArenaAI instance and should not be stored or used beyond that scope.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Global Arena Metrics
    code: 'ArenaAI* ai = ...; // Assume initialized

      const ArenaMetrics& metrics = ai->GetGlobalMetrics();

      uint32 totalMatches = metrics.GetTotalMatches();

      uint32 wins = metrics.GetWins();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ArenaMetrics reference points to a singleton-like object managed
    by the ArenaAI class. Modifications to this data structure should be done through
    dedicated setter methods or internal AI logic, not directly via GetGlobalMetrics.
    This method is thread-safe as long as the underlying ArenaMetrics object is properly
    synchronized.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned ArenaMetrics object through the
    reference, as it's const. Any modifications should be made through appropriate
    interfaces or methods designed for that purpose. The metrics may change during
    gameplay, so caching the reference for extended periods might lead to stale data.
