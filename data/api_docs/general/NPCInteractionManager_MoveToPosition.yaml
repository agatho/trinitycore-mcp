  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: MoveToPosition
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::MoveToPosition(float x, float y, float z)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a movement action for an NPC to a specified world position.
  description: The MoveToPosition method instructs an NPC to move to the given coordinates
    (x, y, z) in the game world. This method is typically used within NPC AI scripts
    or interaction systems to control the movement behavior of non-player characters.
    The method returns true if the movement request was successfully queued or initiated,
    and false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters or system constraints.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with other NPC interaction methods to create
    dynamic and responsive character behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the target position in world space. Valid range
      depends on the map boundaries.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the target position in world space. Valid range
      depends on the map boundaries.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the target position in world space. Represents
      vertical elevation.
  returns: Returns true if the movement request was successfully processed and queued
    for execution, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate invalid coordinates,
    pathfinding failure, or system limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic NPC Movement
    code: "if (npcInteractionManager->MoveToPosition(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f)) {\n \
      \   // Movement initiated successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"npc\", \"NPC started\
      \ moving to position (100, 200, 50)\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate\
      \ movement\n    LOG_ERROR(\"npc\", \"Failed to move NPC to position (100, 200,\
      \ 50)\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Movement with Error Handling
    code: "float targetX = player->GetPositionX() + 10.0f;\nfloat targetY = player->GetPositionY()\
      \ + 10.0f;\nfloat targetZ = player->GetPositionZ();\n\nif (npcInteractionManager->MoveToPosition(targetX,\
      \ targetY, targetZ)) {\n    // Movement started successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      npc\", \"NPC moving to player's offset position\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ movement failure\n    LOG_WARN(\"npc\", \"Could not move NPC to requested\
      \ position\");\n    // Possibly trigger alternative behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically queues the movement action for execution rather than
    performing it immediately. The actual movement may take several frames to complete
    depending on pathfinding complexity and server performance. The coordinates are
    expected to be valid world coordinates within the current map boundaries.
  warnings: Invalid coordinate values (e.g., NaN, infinity) or positions outside of
    valid map boundaries may cause this method to return false without initiating
    movement. Always validate input coordinates before calling this method to prevent
    unexpected behavior.
