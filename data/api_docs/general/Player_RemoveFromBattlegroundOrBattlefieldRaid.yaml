  brief: Removes the player from any active battleground or battlefield raid instance
  description: This method removes the player from the current battleground or battlefield
    raid instance, effectively ending their participation in the combat scenario.
    It is typically called when a player leaves a battleground or battlefield, either
    due to victory, defeat, or manual leave. The method ensures that the player's
    state is properly updated and that they are no longer bound to the specific raid
    instance. This functionality is crucial for maintaining game balance and preventing
    players from remaining in combat zones after their participation has ended.

    zones or experiencing incorrect game state updates, potentially causing issues
