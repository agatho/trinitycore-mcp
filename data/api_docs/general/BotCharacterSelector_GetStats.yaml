  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: GetStats
  signature: const SelectionStats & BotCharacterSelector::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current selection statistics for bot character allocation.
  description: The GetStats method provides access to the internal selection statistics
    maintained by the BotCharacterSelector class. These statistics track various metrics
    related to how bot characters are being selected and allocated within the system.
    The returned SelectionStats object contains information about the number of bots
    processed, successful selections, failed attempts, and other relevant performance
    data. This method is typically used for monitoring and debugging purposes to understand
    the behavior of the character selection algorithm.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a SelectionStats object containing detailed statistics
    about the bot character selection process, including counts of various selection
    outcomes and performance metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Selection Statistics
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      const SelectionStats& stats = selector.GetStats();

      std::cout << "Total selections: " << stats.totalSelections << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Successful: " << stats.successfulSelections << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Failed: " << stats.failedSelections << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data that may be modified by other
    methods in the class. Users should not store or modify the returned object directly
    as it may lead to unexpected behavior. The statistics are updated incrementally
    during selection operations and reflect the current state of the selector.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned SelectionStats object directly, as this can
    corrupt internal state. The reference remains valid only as long as the BotCharacterSelector
    instance exists. Accessing the stats after the selector has been destroyed results
    in undefined behavior.
