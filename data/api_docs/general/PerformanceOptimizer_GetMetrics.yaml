documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current optimization metrics from the PerformanceOptimizer
    instance
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a copy of the current optimization metrics
    collected by the PerformanceOptimizer class. These metrics typically include performance
    statistics such as frame times, update frequencies, resource usage, and other
    relevant data points that help monitor and optimize the game's performance. The
    returned OptimizationMetrics object is immutable and represents a snapshot of
    the metrics at the time of the call. This method does not modify any internal
    state of the PerformanceOptimizer and can be called safely from any thread.
  parameters: []
  returns: An OptimizationMetrics object containing current performance statistics
    including frame times, update rates, and resource usage data that reflects the
    system's performance at the moment the method was invoked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      // ... some performance monitoring code ...

      OptimizationMetrics metrics = optimizer.GetMetrics();

      std::cout << "Average Frame Time: " << metrics.averageFrameTime << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned OptimizationMetrics object is a copy, so modifications to it
    will not affect the internal state of the PerformanceOptimizer. This method is
    designed to be lightweight and should not cause performance degradation when called
    frequently.
