documentation:
  brief: Checks if a group member has assistant permissions.
  description: The IsAssistant method determines whether a specified group member
    holds the assistant role within the group. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, groups can have members with different permission levels, including
    regular members, assistants, and leaders. This method verifies if the given player,
    identified by their GUID, possesses assistant privileges. The check is performed
    against the current group state and returns true if the member has been granted
    assistant status, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified group member has assistant permissions; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player is an assistant
    code: "if (group->IsAssistant(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player has assistant permissions\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"You are an assistant in this group.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Player does not have assistant permissions\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You do not have assistant permissions.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal group member data structures and assumes that
    the group object is valid and properly initialized. It should only be called on
    groups where the player GUID exists.
