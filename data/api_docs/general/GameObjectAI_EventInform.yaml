documentation:
  brief: Handles event notifications sent to the game object AI, allowing for custom
    behavior in response to specific events.
  description: The EventInform method is a virtual callback function within the GameObjectAI
    class that allows game objects to respond to various events triggered during the
    game's execution. This method is invoked when an event occurs that requires the
    AI to take action or update its state. It serves as a communication channel between
    different systems in the TrinityCore framework, enabling dynamic and interactive
    behaviors for game objects such as doors, chests, quest objectives, or interactive
    environment elements. The implementation of this method should be overridden by
    derived classes to define custom behavior upon receiving event notifications.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An unsigned 32-bit integer parameter that represents the event identifier
      or type. This value is typically used to distinguish between different types
      of events that may trigger this callback, allowing the AI implementation to
      branch logic based on the specific event received.
  returns: null

    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    explicit MyGameObjectAI(GameObject*\
      \ go) : GameObjectAI(go) {}\n\n    void EventInform(uint32 param0) override\n\
      \    {\n        switch (param0)\n        {\n            case 1:\n          \
      \      // Handle event type 1\n                break;\n            case 2:\n\
      \                // Handle event type 2\n                break;\n          \
      \  default:\n                // Default handling\n                break;\n \
      \       }\n    }\n};"

    code: "class QuestObjectiveAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    explicit\
      \ QuestObjectiveAI(GameObject* go) : GameObjectAI(go) {}\n\n    void EventInform(uint32\
      \ param0) override\n    {\n        if (param0 == 100)\n        {\n         \
      \   // Notify quest system that objective has been completed\n            if\
      \ (GetGameObject()->GetGOInfo()->questItem)\n            {\n               \
      \ // Trigger quest completion logic\n                GetGameObject()->SetGoState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is part of the GameObjectAI virtual function table and must be
    properly overridden in derived classes to provide meaningful behavior. It's commonly
    used in conjunction with other AI methods like UpdateAI or JustRespawned to create
    complex interactions. The parameter value should be carefully defined and documented
    by the system that triggers this event to ensure proper handling.
  warnings: Improper handling of the param0 value can lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that all possible event types are accounted for in your implementation,
    and consider using a default case to handle unknown events gracefully. Avoid performing
    heavy operations within this method as it may be called frequently during gameplay.
