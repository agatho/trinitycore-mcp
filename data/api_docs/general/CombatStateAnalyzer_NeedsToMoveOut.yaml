  method: NeedsToMoveOut
  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::NeedsToMoveOut() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat state analyzer indicates that a unit needs
    to move out of its current position during combat.
  description: The NeedsToMoveOut method evaluates the current combat state of a unit
    and returns true if the unit should move away from its present location. This
    typically occurs when the unit's positioning is no longer optimal for engaging
    enemies or when environmental factors (such as line of sight, threat distribution,
    or spell casting requirements) dictate a change in position. The method considers
    various combat-related factors including distance to target, available movement
    space, and tactical positioning. It is commonly used by AI systems to make dynamic
    decisions about unit movement during active combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit's current combat state requires it to move out
    of its present position; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (analyzer.NeedsToMoveOut()) {\n    // Initiate movement away from current\
      \ position\n    unit->MoveOutOfCombat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Logic
    code: "void CombatAI::Update()\n{\n    if (analyzer.NeedsToMoveOut())\n    {\n\
      \        // Find a suitable escape point\n        Position escapePoint = GetEscapePosition();\n\
      \        unit->MoveTo(escapePoint);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat update cycles and may involve
    performance considerations when used frequently. The decision logic might be influenced
    by factors such as threat level, target distance, and available terrain for movement.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatStateAnalyzer instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as uninitialized state could lead to unpredictable results.
    This method should not be used in non-combat situations where positioning decisions
    are irrelevant.
