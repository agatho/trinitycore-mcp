  class: FrostDeathKnightRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void FrostDeathKnightRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32
    enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the frost death knight's AoE rotation logic for targeting multiple
    enemies.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for a frost
    death knight's area-of-effect combat rotation. This method evaluates the current
    combat situation, determines optimal abilities to use against multiple targets,
    and executes them in sequence. It considers factors such as enemy count, available
    runes, energy levels, and cooldowns to maximize damage output in AoE scenarios.
    The method is typically invoked during group encounters or when facing multiple
    enemies within the death knight's range.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of target identifiers (GUIDs) representing the
      current enemies in combat. This parameter allows the AI to process multiple
      targets simultaneously.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: The total number of enemies currently engaged in combat with the
      death knight. Used to determine rotation priority and ability selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: 'FrostDeathKnightRefactored dk;

      int targets[5] = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005};

      dk.ExecuteAoERotation(targets, 5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Management in Combat
    code: "FrostDeathKnightRefactored dk;\nint* enemyTargets = new int[enemyList.size()];\n\
      for (size_t i = 0; i < enemyList.size(); ++i) {\n    enemyTargets[i] = enemyList[i]->GetGUID();\n\
      }\ndk.ExecuteAoERotation(enemyTargets, static_cast<uint32>(enemyList.size()));\n\
      delete[] enemyTargets;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all targets are within the death knight's effective
    range. The implementation may include logic to prioritize targets based on threat
    level or proximity. Performance is optimized for up to 10 simultaneous enemies,
    though behavior with higher numbers may vary.
  warnings: Ensure that target pointers are valid and properly allocated before calling
    this method. Passing null or invalid target arrays can lead to undefined behavior.
    The method does not perform any validation of enemy GUIDs internally.
