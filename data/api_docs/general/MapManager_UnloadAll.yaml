documentation:
  brief: Unloads all loaded maps from the MapManager
  description: The UnloadAll method releases all currently loaded map instances from
    memory, ensuring that no map data remains in the system. This operation is typically
    used during server shutdown or when performing maintenance tasks that require
    clearing the map cache. The method iterates through all active maps and properly
    disposes of their resources, including any associated grid data and object references.
    It's important to note that this action is irreversible without reloading the
    maps, and should only be called when it's safe to do so.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Shutdown
    code: "void ShutdownServer()\n{\n    // Perform cleanup operations\n    sMapMgr->UnloadAll();\n\
      \    // Continue with shutdown process\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server shutdown or maintenance. It's
    a blocking operation that may take some time depending on the number of loaded
    maps and their complexity. The method ensures proper cleanup of all map resources
    including grids, objects, and associated data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are actively in the world may cause
    crashes or undefined behavior. Always ensure no players are on any maps before
    calling UnloadAll. This operation cannot be undone without reloading the maps.
