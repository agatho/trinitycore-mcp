  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: AdjustAvoidanceForFormation
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::AdjustAvoidanceForFormation(const int &
    avoidancePos, const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts obstacle avoidance positioning for a specified group within formation
    movement.
  description: The AdjustAvoidanceForFormation method modifies the avoidance behavior
    of an AI unit or group to ensure proper spacing and pathfinding when moving in
    formation. This method is typically used during group movement scenarios where
    units need to avoid obstacles while maintaining their relative positions within
    a formation. It adjusts the internal avoidance parameters based on the provided
    group identifier and current avoidance position, returning a status code indicating
    success or failure of the adjustment operation.
  parameters:
  - name: avoidancePos
    description: The current avoidance position index that determines how far along
      the avoidance path the unit should move. Valid values are typically integers
      representing positions in an avoidance sequence.
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier for which the avoidance behavior is being adjusted.
      This parameter identifies the specific formation or group of units affected
      by this adjustment.
  returns: 'Returns an integer status code: 0 indicates successful adjustment, negative
    values indicate errors such as invalid parameters or internal failures, and positive
    values may represent specific success states or warnings.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int result = obstacleAvoidanceManager->AdjustAvoidanceForFormation(5, 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "int result = obstacleAvoidanceManager->AdjustAvoidanceForFormation(-1,\
      \ 3);\nif (result < 0) {\n    // Handle error\n    std::cout << \"Failed to\
      \ adjust avoidance for formation\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI obstacle avoidance system and interacts with
    internal pathfinding logic. It should be called regularly during movement updates
    to maintain proper group positioning. The method assumes that the group has already
    been initialized and registered within the avoidance manager.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (e.g., negative avoidance
    positions or non-existent group IDs) may result in undefined behavior or errors.
    Ensure that groups are properly initialized before calling this method.
