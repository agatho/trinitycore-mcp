  class: TargetIconChangedHandler
  method: HandleEvent
  signature: bool TargetIconChangedHandler::HandleEvent(const GroupEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Handles group target icon change events and returns true if the event was
    processed successfully.
  description: The TargetIconChangedHandler::HandleEvent method processes group target
    icon change notifications within the TrinityCore framework. This method is invoked
    when a player's target icon (such as a raid marker or loot master indicator) is
    updated in a group context. It validates the incoming event data, ensures proper
    group membership, and updates internal state accordingly. The method integrates
    with the game's group management system to maintain synchronization of target
    icons across all group members. It returns true if the event was successfully
    handled, or false if processing failed due to invalid data or other issues.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A constant reference to a GroupEvent structure containing information
      about the target icon change, including the player who changed the icon, the
      new icon value, and group context details.
  returns: True if the target icon change event was successfully processed and applied
    within the group; false if processing failed due to invalid data, missing group
    context, or other error conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Handling
    code: "void HandleGroupTargetIconChange(GroupEvent const& event)\n{\n    TargetIconChangedHandler\
      \ handler;\n    bool success = handler.HandleEvent(event);\n    if (success)\n\
      \    {\n        // Icon change processed successfully\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Target icon updated successfully\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Failed\
      \ to process the event\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed to handle target icon\
      \ change\");\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically called from within the group management subsystem
    of TrinityCore. It assumes that the GroupEvent parameter contains valid data and
    that the player associated with the event has proper group membership. The handler
    may perform additional validation checks on the target icon value to ensure it's
    within allowed ranges.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with invalid or uninitialized GroupEvent
    objects, as this could lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the group context
    is valid before invoking this handler, as it relies on proper group state management.
