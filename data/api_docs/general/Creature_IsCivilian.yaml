documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is a civilian NPC, returning true if the
    creature is not engaged in combat and is not a quest giver.
  description: The IsCivilian method checks if a creature is classified as a civilian,
    meaning it does not participate in combat or serve as a quest giver. This method
    is used to identify non-combat NPCs that are typically found in towns or cities,
    where they may provide services such as vendor, trainer, or innkeeper functionality.
    The method returns true for creatures that are not flagged as hostile and do not
    have any quest-related behavior enabled. It is commonly used in AI scripts and
    game logic to distinguish between civilian and non-civilian NPCs during various
    gameplay scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is classified as a civilian, false otherwise.
    A civilian creature typically does not engage in combat or serve as a quest giver,
    and may be found in town areas where they provide services like vendor, trainer,
    or innkeeper functionality.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsCivilian()) {\n    // Creature is civilian\n    // Perform\
      \ civilian-specific actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage in AI context
    code: "bool isCivilian = creature->IsCivilian();\nif (isCivilian) {\n    // Handle\
      \ civilian behavior\n    // This creature can be safely interacted with\n}\n\
      else {\n    // Handle non-civilian behavior\n    // This creature may be hostile\
      \ or quest-related\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature classification
    methods to determine NPC behavior. It should be noted that the method may not
    return accurate results for creatures that have been modified through scripting
    or game mechanics, as it relies on standard creature flags and classifications.
  warnings: This method does not account for creatures that may have been modified
    through custom scripts or game mechanics. It's important to verify that the creature
    is truly civilian before using this method in gameplay logic, especially when
    dealing with quest-related behavior or combat scenarios.
