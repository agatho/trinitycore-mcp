  signature: void WarriorAI::OptimizeRageUsage()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes rage usage for the warrior AI by determining the most efficient
    ability to cast based on available rage and combat state.
  description: The OptimizeRageUsage method is responsible for calculating and selecting
    the optimal rage-consuming ability for a warrior AI character. This method evaluates
    the current rage pool, available abilities, and combat context to determine which
    attack or ability will provide the best return on rage investment. It considers
    factors such as weapon type, stance, target health, and cooldowns to make intelligent
    decisions about when and how to spend rage. The method is typically called during
    the AI's update cycle to ensure efficient resource management and optimal damage
    output.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    OptimizeRageUsage();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the warrior AI decision-making system and should be
    called regularly during the AI's update cycle. The implementation likely involves
    complex state tracking and ability evaluation logic that considers multiple combat
    factors simultaneously.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method without proper rage management or ability
    state tracking could lead to inefficient resource usage or invalid ability casting
    decisions in the warrior AI.
