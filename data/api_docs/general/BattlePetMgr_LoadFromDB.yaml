  signature: void BattlePetMgr::LoadFromDB(int pets, int slots)
documentation:
  brief: Loads battle pet data from the database into the manager's internal storage.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes and populates the BattlePetMgr with
    battle pet information retrieved from the database. This method is typically invoked
    during player login or when the battle pet system needs to be refreshed in memory.
    It ensures that all relevant pet data, including pet GUIDs, species, levels, and
    other attributes, are correctly loaded and available for use within the game session.
    The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the BattlePetMgr
    instance.
  parameters:
  - name: pets
    description: An integer representing the number of battle pets to load from the
      database.
  - name: slots
    description: An integer indicating the number of pet slots available for loading
      battle pets into.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petMgr = new BattlePetMgr();

      petMgr->LoadFromDB(5, 3); // Load 5 pets into 3 slots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database connection is already established and
    valid. It should be called after the player session has been initialized but before
    any battle pet interactions occur.
