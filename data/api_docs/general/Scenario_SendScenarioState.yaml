  class: Scenario
  method: SendScenarioState
  signature: void Scenario::SendScenarioState(const int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends the current scenario state to the specified player.
  description: The SendScenarioState method is responsible for transmitting the current
    state of a scenario to a specific player client. This method is typically used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to update players on their progress
    within a scenario, including objectives, timers, and completion status. The method
    ensures that the player's client receives the most up-to-date information about
    the ongoing scenario, allowing for proper UI updates and gameplay mechanics. It
    operates on the principle of sending state data from the server to the client,
    maintaining synchronization between server-side scenario tracking and client-side
    display.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose scenario state needs to be sent.
      This parameter represents the target recipient of the scenario update information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Scenario* scenario = player->GetScenario();

      scenario->SendScenarioState(&player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "if (scenario && player)\n{\n    // Only send state if scenario is active\
      \ and player is valid\n    if (scenario->IsActive())\n    {\n        scenario->SendScenarioState(&player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal packet sending mechanisms to transmit scenario
    data. It should be called whenever there's a change in scenario state that requires
    client synchronization. The method may internally handle serialization of scenario
    progress, objectives, and other relevant data for transmission.
  warnings: Ensure the player pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer dereferences. This method should only be called when the scenario
    is active and the player is properly connected. Calling it with an invalid player
    reference could lead to undefined behavior or client disconnection.
