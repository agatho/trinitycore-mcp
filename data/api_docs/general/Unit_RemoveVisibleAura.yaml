  class: Unit
  method: RemoveVisibleAura
  signature: void Unit::RemoveVisibleAura(AuraApplication * aurApp)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a visible aura application from the unit's aura list.
  description: This method removes a specific aura application from the unit's visible
    aura list, effectively removing the aura from the unit's display. The method is
    typically used when an aura needs to be removed from a unit's visual representation,
    such as when a spell effect expires or when a player is no longer affected by
    a particular aura. It ensures that the aura is properly removed from the unit's
    visible state and updates the client accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that represents the aura being
      removed. This parameter must not be null, as attempting to remove a null aura
      application will result in undefined behavior or potential crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic removal example
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nAuraApplication* auraApp = target->GetAuraApplication(12345);\n\
      if (auraApp)\n{\n    target->RemoveVisibleAura(auraApp);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the visual representation
    of a unit's aura. It is typically called during spell effects or when a player's
    aura status changes, ensuring that the client receives proper updates about the
    removal of visible aura effects.
  warnings: The method assumes that the AuraApplication pointer passed is valid and
    correctly initialized. Passing a null pointer may lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Also, this method should not be used in situations where the aura application
    has already been removed from the unit's list, as it could cause double-free errors.
