  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleIgnoreMovementForces(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes movement force ignoring effects from an aura application.
  description: The HandleIgnoreMovementForces method manages the application state
    of movement force ignoring effects for a given aura. It is typically invoked during
    aura application or removal to modify how movement forces affect the target. This
    method adjusts the target's ability to be influenced by movement-altering effects
    such as knockbacks, pulls, or pushes. The behavior depends on whether the aura
    is being applied or removed and the specific mode of operation. This functionality
    is crucial for certain spells and abilities that need to temporarily disable or
    enable movement restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This parameter determines which aura's effects should be
      handled.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation, indicating how the movement force ignoring
      effect should be processed. Valid values are typically 0 for application and
      1 for removal, though exact values depend on internal TrinityCore implementation.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the movement force ignoring effect. When true, movement forces are ignored;
      when false, normal movement restrictions are restored.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Movement Force Ignore Effect
    code: 'AuraEffect* auraEffect = ...;

      AuraApplication* app = ...;

      auraEffect->HandleIgnoreMovementForces(app, 0, true); // Apply ignore effect'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Movement Force Ignore Effect
    code: 'AuraEffect* auraEffect = ...;

      AuraApplication* app = ...;

      auraEffect->HandleIgnoreMovementForces(app, 1, false); // Remove ignore effect'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system in TrinityCore and interacts
    with movement mechanics. It should only be called during appropriate aura application
    or removal phases to avoid inconsistent behavior. The mode parameter may have
    specific internal values that are not publicly documented.
  warnings: Improper use of this method, especially with incorrect mode values, can
    lead to unexpected movement behavior or client-server desynchronization. Ensure
    the aura application is valid before calling this method.
