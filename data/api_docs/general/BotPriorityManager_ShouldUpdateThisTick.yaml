  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: ShouldUpdateThisTick
  signature: bool BotPriorityManager::ShouldUpdateThisTick(int botGuid, uint32 currentTick)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific bot should be updated during the current tick
    based on its priority and scheduling logic.
  description: The ShouldUpdateThisTick method evaluates if a given bot, identified
    by its GUID, should undergo an update operation during the current game tick.
    This decision is typically based on the bot's priority level, internal scheduling
    rules, and potentially cooldowns or throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive
    processing. The method ensures that bots are updated efficiently without overloading
    the system, especially in environments with many active bots. It returns true
    if the bot should be updated this tick, false otherwise. This functionality is
    crucial for maintaining performance and ensuring fair distribution of CPU resources
    among multiple AI-controlled entities.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that needs to be evaluated
      for update eligibility. This value uniquely identifies a specific bot instance
      within the game world.
  - name: currentTick
    description: The current game tick number used as reference point for determining
      whether the bot should be updated. This value typically represents the global
      tick counter in the TrinityCore system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot should be updated during the current
    tick, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the bot's priority
    and scheduling logic allow for an update at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot management loop
    code: "if (botPriorityManager->ShouldUpdateThisTick(botGuid, currentTick)) {\n\
      \    // Perform bot update logic here\n    bot->Update();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with a tick-based AI update system
    code: "void BotManager::UpdateAllBots(uint32 currentTick) {\n    for (auto& bot\
      \ : activeBots) {\n        if (botPriorityManager->ShouldUpdateThisTick(bot->GetGUID(),\
      \ currentTick)) {\n            bot->DoAIUpdate();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal state tracking to determine bot update eligibility.
    It may consider factors such as bot priority levels, last updated timestamps,
    and system load to make decisions. This function is expected to be called frequently
    during the game loop, so performance is important. The implementation may involve
    caching or precomputed values to avoid expensive calculations on every call.
  warnings: Do not assume that calling this method guarantees a bot will be updated;
    it only indicates eligibility. The actual update logic should still be implemented
    separately. Also, ensure that botGuid and currentTick are valid values to prevent
    unexpected behavior or crashes.
