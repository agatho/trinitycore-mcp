  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: FindDPS
  signature: int LFGBotSelector::FindDPS(uint8 minLevel, uint8 maxLevel, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the number of available DPS bots within the specified level
    range for LFG.
  description: The FindDPS method searches for available bots that are suitable for
    DPS roles within a given level range. It is typically used in the context of Looking
    For Group (LFG) systems to identify appropriate bot participants for dungeons
    or raids. The method filters bots based on their level constraints and returns
    a count of those matching the criteria. This functionality supports automated
    group formation by ensuring that the required role types (in this case, DPS) are
    available within the specified parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: minLevel
    description: The minimum character level allowed for DPS bots in the search. Must
      be a valid level between 1 and 255.
  - name: maxLevel
    description: The maximum character level allowed for DPS bots in the search. Must
      be a valid level between 1 and 255, and should be greater than or equal to minLevel.
  - name: count
    description: The desired number of DPS bots to find. This parameter may influence
      how many bots are selected from the available pool.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of DPS bots found within the
    specified level range. A return value of zero indicates no matching bots were
    found, while a positive integer indicates the count of bots that meet the criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Find 5 DPS bots between levels 60 and 70
    code: int numDpsBots = selector.FindDPS(60, 70, 5);
    language: cpp
  - title: Find all available DPS bots at level 80
    code: int numDpsBots = selector.FindDPS(80, 80, 10);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that bot data is pre-loaded and available within the
    LFGBotSelector instance. The implementation likely involves iterating through
    a list of registered bots and applying level filters to determine eligibility
    for DPS roles.
  warnings: Ensure that minLevel is not greater than maxLevel, as this could lead
    to incorrect results or undefined behavior. Also, be aware that the actual number
    of bots returned may be less than requested if insufficient bots exist within
    the specified range.
