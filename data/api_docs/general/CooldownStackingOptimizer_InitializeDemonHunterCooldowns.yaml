  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::InitializeDemonHunterCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for Demon Hunter class abilities.
  description: The InitializeDemonHunterCooldowns method sets up internal data structures
    and state management for tracking cooldowns specific to Demon Hunter class abilities
    within the CooldownStackingOptimizer system. This method prepares the optimizer
    to handle the unique cooldown mechanics of Demon Hunter specs, including Havoc
    and Vengeance, ensuring proper stacking calculations and priority management for
    abilities like Eye Beam, Fel Rush, and other key spells. The initialization process
    typically occurs during player login or spec switching to ensure accurate cooldown
    tracking throughout the session.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeDemonHunterCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player session after the Demon
    Hunter class has been initialized. The method assumes that the player's current
    spec and talent information is already available in the system. It may internally
    query the player's active abilities and cooldown state to set up proper tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate cooldown entries or inconsistent tracking behavior. Ensure that the
    player object is fully initialized with class-specific data before invoking this
    method.
