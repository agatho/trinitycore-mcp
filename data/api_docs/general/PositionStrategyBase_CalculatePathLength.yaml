  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: CalculatePathLength
  signature: float PositionStrategyBase::CalculatePathLength(const int & path) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total length of a specified path in world coordinates.
  description: 'The CalculatePathLength method computes the cumulative distance of
    all waypoints in a given path, returning the result as a floating-point value
    representing meters. This method is typically used by AI systems to evaluate movement
    strategies or determine if a path exceeds certain distance thresholds. The path
    parameter refers to an identifier or index that uniquely identifies a precomputed
    navigation path within the system. The calculation includes all segments between
    consecutive waypoints in the path, using Euclidean distance formula for each segment.
    Precondition: The specified path must exist and be valid; otherwise, behavior
    is undefined.'
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: An integer identifier referencing a specific precomputed navigation
      path. This value should correspond to a valid path index within the system's
      pathfinding data structures.
  returns: A float value representing the total length of the specified path in world
    units (typically meters). Returns zero if the path is invalid or contains no waypoints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float pathLength = positionStrategy->CalculatePathLength(5);\nif (pathLength\
      \ > 100.0f)\n{\n    // Path too long for current movement strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Path Length Validation
    code: "int pathId = GetNextPathId();\nfloat length = positionStrategy->CalculatePathLength(pathId);\n\
      if (length < 50.0f)\n{\n    // Consider alternative path or adjust movement\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the path data is already computed and stored in
    memory. Performance may vary depending on the number of waypoints in the path,
    as each segment requires distance calculation. The implementation likely uses
    optimized vector math operations for calculating Euclidean distances between consecutive
    points.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized path identifier may
    lead to undefined behavior or access violations. Always validate that the path
    exists before calling this function.
