  signature: void InterruptDatabase::LoadDungeonSpells()
documentation:
  brief: Loads dungeon spell data from the database into memory for use in interrupt
    handling.
  description: The LoadDungeonSpells method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with dungeon-specific spell information required for interrupt mechanics
    in World of Warcraft. This method is typically called during server startup or
    database reload operations to ensure that all relevant dungeon spells are available
    for processing when players encounter interrupts. The method retrieves spell data
    from the database tables containing dungeon-related spell definitions and stores
    them in memory for fast lookup during gameplay. It handles loading of spell IDs,
    associated interrupt types, and any conditional requirements for dungeon-specific
    spell interruptions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'InterruptDatabase* interruptDB = new InterruptDatabase();

      interruptDB->LoadDungeonSpells();

      // Dungeon spells are now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and valid. The method performs no error handling for individual spell loading
    failures, but will log warnings if database queries fail. It's designed to be
    thread-safe when called during server initialization, though concurrent access
    during runtime should be avoided.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    memory leaks or duplicate entries. Ensure that the database connection is properly
    initialized before invoking this method. This method does not validate spell IDs
    against the current spell database - invalid references may cause runtime issues.
