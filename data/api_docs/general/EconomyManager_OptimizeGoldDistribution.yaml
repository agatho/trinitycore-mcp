documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the distribution of gold across player accounts in the economy
    system.
  description: The OptimizeGoldDistribution method redistributes gold among players
    within the TrinityCore economy system to ensure balanced currency flow and prevent
    excessive accumulation by individual players. This method typically runs periodically
    as part of the server's economic maintenance routines. It evaluates current gold
    holdings, applies redistribution rules based on player activity, account status,
    or other criteria, and adjusts balances accordingly. The optimization process
    may involve transferring gold between accounts, applying taxes, or resetting excessive
    balances to maintain a healthy in-game economy. This method is usually invoked
    by the server's economy manager module during scheduled maintenance windows or
    economic updates.

  notes: This method is typically called during server maintenance or economic update
    cycles. It may temporarily lock player accounts during redistribution to prevent
    concurrent modifications. The exact redistribution algorithm and criteria are
    configurable within the TrinityCore configuration files.
  warnings: Invoking this method manually during active gameplay may cause temporary
    account balance inconsistencies or unexpected behavior. It should only be called
    from trusted system routines or maintenance scripts.
