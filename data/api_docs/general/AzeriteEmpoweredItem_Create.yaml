  class: AzeriteEmpoweredItem
  method: Create
  signature: bool AzeriteEmpoweredItem::Create(int guidlow, int itemId, int context,
    const int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Azerite empowered item with specified properties.
  description: The Create method initializes a new AzeriteEmpoweredItem instance using
    the provided GUID low value, item ID, context, and owner. This method is typically
    used during item creation or loading processes within the TrinityCore framework
    to set up the necessary data structures for Azerite empowered items. The method
    returns true upon successful initialization, or false if any of the required parameters
    are invalid or if the creation process fails. Azerite empowered items in World
    of Warcraft represent gear that can be upgraded with Azerite powers, and this
    method ensures proper setup of such items during their lifecycle.
  parameters:
  - name: guidlow
    description: The low part of the unique identifier (GUID) for the item. This value
      uniquely identifies the item within the game world.
  - name: itemId
    description: The template ID of the item being created. This corresponds to the
      ItemTemplate entry in the database.
  - name: context
    description: The context in which the item is being created, often representing
      item level or quality context for Azerite empowerment.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the owner's GUID low value. This parameter determines
      which player or entity owns the item.
  returns: True if the Azerite empowered item was successfully created and initialized
    with the provided parameters; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Azerite Item Creation
    code: "AzeriteEmpoweredItem item;\nbool success = item.Create(12345, 123456, 100,\
      \ &playerGuidLow);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Item successfully created\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Azerite Item Creation with Error Handling
    code: "AzeriteEmpoweredItem* newItem = new AzeriteEmpoweredItem();\nint ownerGuid\
      \ = player->GetGUIDLow();\nif (!newItem->Create(98765, 654321, 150, &ownerGuid))\n\
      {\n    // Handle creation failure\n    delete newItem;\n    newItem = nullptr;\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Successfully created item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Azerite system implementation in TrinityCore,
    which handles the empowerment mechanics for items. The context parameter may influence
    how Azerite powers are applied or scaled. The owner parameter should point to
    a valid GUID low value that corresponds to an existing player or entity in the
    game world.
  warnings: The owner parameter must be a valid pointer to a GUID low value; passing
    null or invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the itemId
    corresponds to a valid item template that supports Azerite empowerment, otherwise
    the item may not function correctly in-game.
