documentation:
  brief: Schedules a quest pickup request for processing within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The ScheduleQuestPickup method is responsible for queuing a QuestPickupRequest
    for later execution within the game's quest system. This method typically handles
    the asynchronous scheduling of quest-related events, ensuring that pickup operations
    are processed at an appropriate time without blocking the main game thread. It
    integrates with the core quest management subsystem to manage when and how quest
    pickups are handled, particularly in scenarios involving multiple concurrent requests
    or delayed processing. The method does not directly perform the pickup action
    but rather prepares it for execution by the appropriate subsystem.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: A const reference to a QuestPickupRequest object containing all necessary
      data and context for scheduling the quest pickup operation, including player
      information, quest identifiers, and any associated parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Pickup Scheduling
    code: 'QuestPickupRequest request;

      request.playerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      request.questId = 12345;

      questPickup->ScheduleQuestPickup(request);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the game's main update loop or
    event handlers. The actual pickup processing may be deferred until the next tick
    of the quest system's scheduler, allowing for better performance and avoiding
    race conditions in concurrent environments.
