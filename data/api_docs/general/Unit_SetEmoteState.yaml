  class: Unit
  method: SetEmoteState
  signature: void Unit::SetEmoteState(int emote)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the emote state of the unit to the specified emote value.
  description: This method allows a unit (such as a player or creature) to display
    an emote state, which represents a specific animation or action that the unit
    performs. The emote state is typically used for visual representation of actions
    like sitting, standing, or other gestures. This method does not directly affect
    the unit's physical position but rather controls the visual behavior of the unit
    in terms of emotes. The emote value should be a valid emote ID from the game's
    emote database, and setting it will cause the unit to perform that emote immediately.
  parameters:
  - name: emote
    description: The emote ID to set for the unit. This is typically an integer value
      representing a specific emote from the game's emote database, such as 1 for
      standing, 2 for sitting, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetEmoteState(1); // Sets the unit to stand

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetEmoteState(2); // Sets the unit to sit

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other emote-related methods
    like SetEmoteState or GetEmoteState. It's important to note that emotes are not
    just visual effects; they can also be used for gameplay mechanics such as triggering
    certain events or interactions with other players. The implementation may vary
    depending on whether the unit is a player or NPC, and it should be used carefully
    to avoid unintended behavior.
  warnings: This method should only be used when the unit is in a state where emotes
    are appropriate and allowed. Using invalid emote values can cause visual glitches
    or unexpected behavior in game mechanics. Also, ensure that the emote ID is valid
    and corresponds to an actual emote in the game database.
