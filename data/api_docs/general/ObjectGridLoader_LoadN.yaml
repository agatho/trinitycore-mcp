documentation:
  brief: Loads all objects in the grid for the current map
  description: The LoadN method is responsible for loading all game objects (creatures,
    gameobjects, players) that are present within the grid cells of the current map.
    This method typically executes during map initialization or when a player enters
    a new grid area. It ensures that all relevant objects are properly instantiated
    and registered with the world system. The method operates on the grid-based spatial
    partitioning system used by TrinityCore to efficiently manage object loading and
    unloading based on player proximity.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in map loading context
    code: "void Map::LoadGridObjects()\n{\n    ObjectGridLoader loader;\n    loader.LoadN();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the map loading process and should
    not be invoked manually during normal gameplay. The method relies on grid coordinates
    and spatial partitioning to determine which objects need loading. It may trigger
    additional loading operations for related objects such as nearby creatures or
    gameobjects.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper map loading contexts can lead to
    object duplication, memory leaks, or inconsistent world state. The method assumes
    that the grid system is properly initialized and that the current map context
    is valid.
