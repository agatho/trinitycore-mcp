documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the minion is a Doomguard pet.
  description: This method checks if the current minion instance represents a Doomguard
    pet summoned by a warlock. It evaluates the creature's entry ID and flags to determine
    if it matches the specific Doomguard type. The method is commonly used in AI logic
    and pet management systems within the TrinityCore framework. This check is essential
    for warlock-specific abilities and spell interactions that target or affect Doomguard
    pets specifically.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the minion is a Doomguard pet (creature entry ID 11859),
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if minion is a Doomguard
    code: "if (minion->IsPetDoomguard()) {\n    // Handle Doomguard-specific logic\n\
      \    SendDoomguardMessage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in warlock pet AI
    code: "class WarlockPetAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (me->IsPet() && me->ToPet()->GetEntry() == 11859)\
      \ {\n            if (IsPetDoomguard()) {\n                // Apply Doomguard-specific\
      \ behavior\n                DoDoomguardAbility();\n            }\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the creature entry ID 11859 which is hardcoded for
    Doomguard pets in World of Warcraft. The implementation may need to be updated
    if Blizzard changes pet entries in future expansions. This check is lightweight
    and suitable for frequent use in AI update loops.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks for the specific Doomguard entry
    ID (11859). Other summoned demons or pets with similar appearance may not return
    true even if they appear visually like a Doomguard.
