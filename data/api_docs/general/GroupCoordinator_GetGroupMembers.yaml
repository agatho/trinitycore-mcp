api:
  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: GetGroupMembers
  signature: int GroupCoordinator::GetGroupMembers() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of members currently in the group coordinated
    by this GroupCoordinator instance.
  description: The GetGroupMembers method returns an integer value representing the
    count of players currently part of the group managed by this GroupCoordinator.
    This method is typically used to determine the size of a group for various game
    mechanics such as loot distribution, quest progression, or raid coordination.
    The returned value includes all active members of the group, including the leader
    and any regular members. This method does not perform any modifications to the
    group state and is safe to call at any time during gameplay. It's commonly used
    in conjunction with other group management functions to ensure proper handling
    of group-based activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of members currently in the group.
    Returns 0 if the group is empty or invalid, and may return negative values in
    error conditions (though this depends on implementation details).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Group Size
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinatorForPlayer(player);\n\
      if (coordinator)\n{\n    int memberCount = coordinator->GetGroupMembers();\n\
      \    if (memberCount > 0)\n    {\n        // Proceed with group-based logic\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Group has %d members\", memberCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a read-only operation and does not modify any internal state
    of the GroupCoordinator. It's recommended to cache this value if it will be used
    multiple times within a single game tick to avoid repeated calls. The performance
    impact is minimal as it typically just returns a cached member count.
  warnings: Be aware that calling this method on a destroyed or invalid GroupCoordinator
    instance may result in undefined behavior. Always verify the validity of the GroupCoordinator
    pointer before invoking this method.
