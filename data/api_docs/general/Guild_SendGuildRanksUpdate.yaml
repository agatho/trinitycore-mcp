  signature: void Guild::SendGuildRanksUpdate(int setterGuid, int targetGuid, GuildRankId
    rank)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild rank update message to all online guild members.
  description: The SendGuildRanksUpdate method is responsible for notifying all currently
    online members of a guild about a change in a specific member's guild rank. This
    method ensures that the guild interface and related UI elements are updated across
    all client instances. The update includes information about which player's rank
    has changed, who made the change (setter), and what the new rank is. It typically
    gets invoked when a guild officer or leader promotes or demotes a guild member
    through the in-game guild management system.
  parameters:
  - name: setterGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is making the
      rank change. This should be a valid player GUID from the game world.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose guild rank
      is being updated. This must correspond to an actual guild member.
  - name: rank
    description: The new GuildRankId that the target player is being assigned. This
      value should be a valid rank ID within the range of allowed guild ranks for
      this guild.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Guild* guild = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (guild)\n{\n\
      \    guild->SendGuildRanksUpdate(player1Guid, player2Guid, GR_OFFICER);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Rank Validation
    code: "if (guild && guild->IsMember(playerGuid))\n{\n    // Ensure the rank is\
      \ valid before sending update\n    if (newRank >= GR_INITIATE && newRank <=\
      \ GR_GUILD_MASTER)\n    {\n        guild->SendGuildRanksUpdate(setterGuid, playerGuid,\
      \ newRank);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only sends updates to players currently online. Offline members
    will receive the updated rank information upon logging back in. The method does
    not perform any validation on the input parameters beyond basic type checking;
    it's expected that callers ensure valid GUIDs and rank IDs are passed.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in incorrect
    UI updates or client-side errors if invalid GUIDs or out-of-range rank values
    are provided. It should only be called from within a valid game context where
    guild operations are permitted.
