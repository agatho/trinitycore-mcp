documentation:
  brief: Sets the action and type for an action button in the player's action bar
  description: The SetActionAndType method configures an action button by assigning
    it a specific action identifier and defining its type. This method is used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to manage the state of action buttons displayed on
    the player's user interface. The action parameter typically represents the identifier
    for the spell, item, or other game action that the button should execute, while
    the type parameter specifies what kind of action this button represents (e.g.,
    spell, item, macro, etc.). This method is crucial for maintaining synchronization
    between the client UI and the server-side action state.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: The unique identifier for the action this button represents. This
      can be a spell ID, item entry, or other game action identifier depending on
      the button type.
  - name: type
    description: The type of action this button represents. Must be one of the predefined
      ActionButtonType values such as ACTION_BUTTON_SPELL, ACTION_BUTTON_ITEM, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Spell Action Button
    code: 'ActionButton* button = player->GetActionButton(1);

      button->SetActionAndType(80001, ACTION_BUTTON_SPELL); // Set button to cast
      spell ID 80001'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting an Item Action Button
    code: 'ActionButton* button = player->GetActionButton(5);

      button->SetActionAndType(12345, ACTION_BUTTON_ITEM); // Set button to use item
      ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during action bar initialization or when
    updating button states. It does not automatically update the client UI - that
    requires additional network messages. The method assumes valid input parameters
    and performs no validation checks internally.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid action IDs or unsupported types may lead
    to undefined behavior or client-side errors. Always ensure that the action ID
    corresponds to a valid spell, item, or other game object before calling this method.
