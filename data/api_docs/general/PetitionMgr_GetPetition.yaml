  class: PetitionMgr
  method: GetPetition
  signature: Petition * PetitionMgr::GetPetition(int petitionGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a petition object by its unique identifier from the petition manager.
  description: The GetPetition method fetches a Petition object from the PetitionMgr
    system using the provided petition GUID. This method is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's petition system to access specific guild charter or player signature
    data. The returned petition object can be used to examine petition details such
    as owner, signatures, and status. It is important to note that this method may
    return a null pointer if no petition exists with the specified GUID, so callers
    should always validate the result before using it.
  parameters:
  - name: petitionGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the petition to retrieve. This value
      corresponds to the database entry for the petition and is typically generated
      when a new petition is created.
  returns: A pointer to the Petition object if found, or nullptr if no petition exists
    with the specified GUID. The returned pointer should be checked for null before
    dereferencing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Petition* petition = sPetitionMgr->GetPetition(12345);\nif (petition !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the petition object\n    uint32 ownerGuid = petition->GetOwnerGuid();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "uint32 petitionId = 54321;\nPetition* petition = sPetitionMgr->GetPetition(petitionId);\n\
      if (petition == nullptr)\n{\n    // Handle case where petition does not exist\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"No petition found with ID %u\", petitionId);\n    return;\n\
      }\n// Proceed with using the petition safely\nuint32 signatureCount = petition->GetSignatureCount();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in an internal container or map maintained
    by PetitionMgr. Performance is generally O(1) for hash-based lookups, but depends
    on the underlying implementation. The returned Petition object should not be deleted
    by the caller as it's managed by the PetitionMgr system.
  warnings: Always check the return value for null before using the petition object.
    Accessing a null pointer will cause a crash. Additionally, the petition object
    may become invalid if the petition is deleted or modified elsewhere in the system
    during use.
