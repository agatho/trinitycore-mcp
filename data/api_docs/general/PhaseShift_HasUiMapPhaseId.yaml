  signature: bool PhaseShift::HasUiMapPhaseId(uint32 uiMapPhaseId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the PhaseShift object contains a specific UI map phase ID.
  description: The HasUiMapPhaseId method determines whether a given UI map phase
    ID is present in the current PhaseShift object. This functionality is crucial
    for managing phase-based visibility and interaction in World of Warcraft, particularly
    when dealing with user interface elements that should only be visible during certain
    phases. The method performs a lookup within the internal collection of UI map
    phase IDs associated with the PhaseShift instance. It returns true if the specified
    phase ID exists in the collection, false otherwise. This check is commonly used
    to control visibility of quest markers, minimap icons, and other UI components
    that are tied to specific game phases.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified UI map phase ID is found in the PhaseShift's
    internal collection; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (phaseShift.HasUiMapPhaseId(1234))\n{\n    // UI element should be visible\n\
      \    uiElement->Show();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // UI element should be hidden\n  \
      \  uiElement->Hide();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Phase-Based UI Control
    code: "void UpdatePlayerUI(Player* player)\n{\n    PhaseShift& phaseShift = player->GetPhaseShift();\n\
      \    if (phaseShift.HasUiMapPhaseId(5678))\n    {\n        // Enable special\
      \ quest markers\n        player->SetFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS, PLAYER_FLAG_QUEST_LOG_OPEN);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Disable special quest markers\n        player->RemoveFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS,\
      \ PLAYER_FLAG_QUEST_LOG_OPEN);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the internal UI map phase ID
    collection. For performance-critical code paths, consider caching results or using
    alternative data structures if frequent lookups are required. The PhaseShift object
    maintains its own collection of UI map phase IDs separate from regular phase IDs.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks UI map phase IDs and not general
    phase IDs. Ensure you're checking the correct type of phase ID for your use case
    to avoid unexpected behavior in phase-based UI logic.
