  signature: bool WorldObject::IsPrivateObject() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the world object is a private object, typically used for
    determining visibility and interaction rules in the game world.
  description: The IsPrivateObject method checks if a WorldObject instance represents
    a private object within the TrinityCore framework. In World of Warcraft terms,
    private objects are those that may not be visible or interactable by all players,
    often related to specific player-owned entities such as pets, vehicles, or other
    objects with restricted access. This method is commonly used in visibility calculations
    and object interaction logic to enforce game rules regarding which players can
    see or interact with certain objects. The method does not take any parameters
    and returns a boolean value indicating the private status of the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the WorldObject is considered a private object, false otherwise.
    Private objects typically have restricted visibility or interaction rules within
    the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an object is private before allowing interaction
    code: "if (worldObject->IsPrivateObject()) {\n    // Handle private object logic\n\
      \    // e.g., restrict access or show special UI\n} else {\n    // Allow normal\
      \ interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsPrivateObject in visibility calculations
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nWorldObject* object = ...;\nif (!object->IsPrivateObject()\
      \ || player->IsInSameGroup(object)) {\n    // Object is visible to player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other visibility and access
    control mechanisms within TrinityCore. The implementation may vary depending on
    the specific type of WorldObject (Creature, GameObject, Item, etc.) and its associated
    flags or ownership rules.
  warnings: Developers should be aware that the behavior of IsPrivateObject might
    differ based on object type and context. It's important to verify the object's
    type before calling this method if the logic depends on specific object categories.
