  class: PathfindingManager
  method: FindPathToUnit
  signature: PathResult PathfindingManager::FindPathToUnit(Unit * target, float range,
    PathFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a path to the specified unit within the given range
    using the provided path flags.
  description: The FindPathToUnit method computes a navigable path from the caller's
    current position to a target Unit, considering the specified range and pathfinding
    flags. It utilizes TrinityCore's internal pathfinding system to determine whether
    a valid route exists between the two entities. The method is commonly used by
    AI-controlled creatures or NPCs to navigate toward players or other units. The
    returned PathResult contains information about the success of the path calculation
    and can be used to determine if movement along the path should proceed. This function
    respects terrain, obstacles, and unit-specific movement constraints defined by
    the provided flags.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Unit for which the path is being calculated.
      Must not be null.
  - name: range
    description: Maximum distance within which the path should lead to the target
      unit. A value of 0.0f typically means no range restriction.
  - name: flags
    description: PathFlags that define how the pathfinding algorithm behaves, such
      as whether to avoid water or obstacles. These flags control path quality and
      constraints.
  returns: A PathResult object indicating the success or failure of the pathfinding
    operation. On success, it contains valid path data; on failure, it indicates why
    no path was found (e.g., invalid target, unreachable destination).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find a path to a player unit
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // Assume this is a valid player or NPC\nfloat range\
      \ = 10.0f;\nPathFlags flags = PATHFINDING_NORMAL;\nPathResult result = sPathfindingManager->FindPathToUnit(target,\
      \ range, flags);\nif (result.IsSuccess()) {\n    // Proceed with movement along\
      \ the path\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using FindPathToUnit for AI navigation with custom flags
    code: "Unit* target = ...;\nfloat range = 5.0f;\nPathFlags flags = PATHFINDING_NO_WATER\
      \ | PATHFINDING_NO_OBSTACLES;\nPathResult result = sPathfindingManager->FindPathToUnit(target,\
      \ range, flags);\nif (result.IsSuccess()) {\n    // AI can now move along the\
      \ path\n    // Example: Move towards the first point in the path\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is blocking and may impact performance if called frequently without
    optimization. It internally uses the NavMesh system for pathfinding, so ensure
    that the target unit's location is valid and within loaded grids. The PathResult
    object returned should be checked for validity before attempting to use the path
    data.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null target pointer; it will likely crash
    or produce undefined behavior. Avoid calling this in tight loops without caching
    results, as pathfinding can be computationally expensive. Be aware that even if
    a path is found, it may not be traversable due to dynamic obstacles or terrain
    changes.
