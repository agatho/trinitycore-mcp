  brief: Sends remote Garrison information to the player's client
  description: The SendRemoteInfo method is responsible for transmitting garrison-related
    data from the server to the client's game interface. This method typically handles
    the synchronization of garrison details such as building status, resource levels,
    and other remote garrison properties that need to be displayed or updated in the
    player's UI. The method is usually invoked when a player interacts with their
    garrison or when periodic updates are required to maintain consistency between
    server state and client display.

    code: "void Player::HandleGarrisonUpdate()\n{\n    if (GetGarrison())\n    {\n\
      \        GetGarrison()->SendRemoteInfo();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers a network packet transmission to update the client's
    garrison UI. It may be called automatically during certain garrison events or
    manually when explicit updates are needed.
