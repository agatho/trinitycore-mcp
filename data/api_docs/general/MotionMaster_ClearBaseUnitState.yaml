  class: MotionMaster
  method: ClearBaseUnitState
  signature: void MotionMaster::ClearBaseUnitState(const MovementGenerator * movement)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the base unit state associated with a specific movement generator
    from the motion master.
  description: The ClearBaseUnitState method removes the base unit state that is linked
    to a given movement generator from the MotionMaster's internal tracking. This
    typically occurs when a movement generator is being replaced or removed, ensuring
    that stale or outdated state information does not persist. The method operates
    on the assumption that the provided movement generator is currently active within
    the motion master's state management system. It is commonly used during movement
    updates, transitions, or cleanup operations to maintain consistency in unit movement
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: movement
    description: A pointer to the MovementGenerator whose base unit state should be
      cleared. This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid movement
      generator currently managed by this MotionMaster instance.
  returns: None. The method performs an in-place modification of the MotionMaster's
    internal state and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Base Unit State for a Movement Generator
    code: 'MovementGenerator* mg = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();

      unit->GetMotionMaster()->ClearBaseUnitState(mg);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the MotionMaster during movement
    transitions or when a movement generator is being replaced. It's important to
    ensure that the provided MovementGenerator pointer is valid and corresponds to
    an active generator managed by this MotionMaster instance, otherwise behavior
    may be undefined.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or a MovementGenerator not currently managed by
    this MotionMaster can lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. Always
    verify that the movement generator exists in the motion master's active list before
    calling this method.
