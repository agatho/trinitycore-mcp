  class: Action
  method: IsPossible
  signature: bool Action::IsPossible(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the action can be executed by the bot AI.
  description: The IsPossible method evaluates whether a given action is currently
    feasible for execution within the context of the provided bot AI. It performs
    necessary validations to determine if all preconditions required for the action
    are met, such as resource availability, target validity, or state constraints.
    This method is typically used during action selection and planning phases to filter
    out invalid actions before attempting their execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the action is possible to execute under current conditions;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (action.IsPossible(ai)) {\n    action.Execute(ai);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle impossible action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during AI update cycles to ensure
    that only valid actions are considered for execution. It may perform lightweight
    checks but could involve state lookups or condition evaluations depending on the
    specific implementation of the Action class.
