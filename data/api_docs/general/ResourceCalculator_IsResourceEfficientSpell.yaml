  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: IsResourceEfficientSpell
  signature: bool ResourceCalculator::IsResourceEfficientSpell(uint32 spellId, int
    * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell is considered resource-efficient based on its
    properties and caster.
  description: The IsResourceEfficientSpell method evaluates if a given spell ID meets
    criteria for being classified as resource-efficient. This typically involves checking
    spell properties such as mana cost, power type, and other resource-related attributes.
    The method may consider the caster's class or specialization to determine appropriate
    efficiency thresholds. It is commonly used in gameplay logic to optimize spell
    usage, enforce resource management rules, or adjust spell behavior based on player
    resources.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to evaluate for resource efficiency.
      Must be a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's identifier or index.
      Can be null if not required for evaluation, otherwise should point to a valid
      caster object reference.
  returns: Returns true if the spell is considered resource-efficient according to
    internal criteria; false otherwise. The exact conditions for efficiency are determined
    by game mechanics and may vary based on spell properties and caster context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spell efficiency
    code: "uint32 spellId = 12345;\nint casterId = 0;\nbool isEfficient = ResourceCalculator::IsResourceEfficientSpell(spellId,\
      \ &casterId);\nif (isEfficient)\n{\n    // Handle resource-efficient spell logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic caster reference
    code: "uint32 spellId = 67890;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\n\
      bool isEfficient = ResourceCalculator::IsResourceEfficientSpell(spellId, &player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      if (isEfficient)\n{\n    // Apply special handling for efficient spells\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal spell data structures and may perform
    lookups in the spell database. Performance is generally acceptable for single
    checks but could be impacted by frequent calls in tight loops. The exact efficiency
    criteria are implementation-defined and may change with game updates or patches.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to an existing spell in
    the game's database, otherwise behavior is undefined. When using the caster parameter,
    make sure it points to a valid object or is null to avoid potential crashes or
    incorrect results.
