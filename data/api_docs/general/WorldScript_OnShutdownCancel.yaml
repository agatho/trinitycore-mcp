documentation:
  brief: Called when a pending server shutdown is canceled
  description: This method is invoked by the TrinityCore server framework when a scheduled
    shutdown operation is aborted. It allows WorldScript implementations to perform
    cleanup or notification tasks when the shutdown process is cancelled before completion.
    The method serves as a callback mechanism for scripts that need to react to shutdown
    cancellation events, ensuring proper state management and resource handling. This
    typically occurs when an admin cancels a shutdown command that was previously
    issued via console or in-game commands.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Implementation
    code: "class MyWorldScript : public WorldScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnShutdownCancel()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Log that shutdown was canceled\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Shutdown has been canceled.\");\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WorldScript callback system and executes in the
    main server thread. It should not perform heavy operations that could block the
    server's main loop. The cancellation typically occurs during the pre-shutdown
    phase when the shutdown timer is active but before the actual shutdown sequence
    begins.
  warnings: Avoid performing long-running operations within this method as it may
    delay server responsiveness. Ensure that any cleanup or state changes performed
    here are thread-safe and do not interfere with other systems.
