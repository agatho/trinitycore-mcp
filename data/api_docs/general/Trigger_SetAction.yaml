  class: Trigger
  method: SetAction
  signature: void Trigger::SetAction(const std::string & actionName)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the action name for the trigger, determining its behavior in the game
    world.
  description: The SetAction method assigns a specific action name to a Trigger object,
    which controls how the trigger behaves when activated. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with trigger events and AI systems within TrinityCore's framework.
    The action name determines what script or behavior is executed when the trigger
    is engaged. The method does not validate whether the action name exists or is
    valid; it simply assigns the provided string to the internal action field of the
    trigger. This allows for dynamic behavior modification of triggers during runtime
    based on game conditions or player interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: actionName
    description: A string representing the name of the action to be assigned to this
      trigger. This string is used to identify and execute specific behaviors when
      the trigger is activated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Action Assignment
    code: 'Trigger* trigger = ...; // Get a reference to a trigger

      trigger->SetAction("ActivateDoor"); // Assigns the action name to the trigger'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Trigger Action Based on Game State
    code: "Trigger* trigger = ...;\nif (player->HasQuest(12345))\n{\n    trigger->SetAction(\"\
      QuestCompleteEvent\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    trigger->SetAction(\"QuestIncompleteEvent\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the Trigger object. It
    should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments where concurrent access
    to the same trigger instance might occur. The action name string is stored as-is
    and will be used by the game engine's event system when the trigger is activated.
  warnings: Ensure that the actionName parameter does not contain invalid characters
    or sequences that could cause issues with the underlying scripting system. Improperly
    set action names may result in triggers failing to execute expected behaviors
    or causing runtime errors.
