documentation:
  brief: Initializes a non-melee spell damage instance with attacker, target, spell
    info, and related parameters.
  description: The SpellNonMeleeDamage constructor initializes a non-melee spell damage
    event in the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the necessary data structures
    for handling spell effects that do not involve direct melee combat, such as ranged
    attacks, magical spells, or area-of-effect abilities. It takes references to the
    attacker and target entities, along with spell information and visual data to
    properly process and apply damage calculations. The method is typically used internally
    by the spell system when a non-melee spell is cast and needs to be processed for
    damage application.
  parameters:
  - name: _attacker
    description: Pointer to the attacker entity's identifier, typically representing
      the caster or source of the spell. Must not be null.
  - name: _target
    description: Pointer to the target entity's identifier, representing the recipient
      of the spell damage. Must not be null.
  - name: _spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the spell being cast, including damage values, school mask, and other
      spell properties.
  - name: spellVisual
    description: Integer value representing the visual effect ID associated with the
      spell. Used for displaying appropriate spell effects to players.
  - name: _schoolMask
    description: Bitmask indicating the magic school(s) of the spell damage (e.g.,
      fire, frost, nature). Used for damage type calculations and resistances.
  - name: _castId
    description: Unique identifier for the spell cast instance. Helps track specific
      spell casts and their associated effects in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: 'SpellNonMeleeDamage damage(&attackerGuid, &targetGuid, spellInfo, 12345,
      SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_FIRE, 67890);

      // This initializes a fire spell damage event with visual ID 12345 and cast
      ID 67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Damage for Mage Fireball Spell
    code: 'SpellInfo* fireballSpell = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(133);

      uint32 visualId = 15678;

      uint32 schoolMask = SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_FIRE;

      SpellNonMeleeDamage damage(&casterGuid, &targetGuid, fireballSpell, visualId,
      schoolMask, castId);

      // Initializes a fireball spell damage event for mage class'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell processing system and should not
    be called directly by external modules. The constructor handles all necessary
    initialization and setup for non-melee spell damage events. It's important to
    ensure that all parameters are valid before calling this method, as null pointers
    or invalid spell info can cause runtime errors.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you're implementing a custom
    spell handler or modifying the core spell system. The SpellNonMeleeDamage class
    is designed to be used internally by TrinityCore's spell processing engine. Passing
    invalid parameters may lead to undefined behavior or crashes in the game server.
