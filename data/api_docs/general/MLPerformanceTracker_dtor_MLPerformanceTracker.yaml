documentation:
  brief: Destroys the MLPerformanceTracker instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the MLPerformanceTracker class is responsible for
    releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the tracker. This
    method ensures proper cleanup when an instance of MLPerformanceTracker goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    performance tracking objects may hold data structures related to machine learning
    model execution times, resource usage, or other profiling metrics that need to
    be properly disposed of to prevent memory leaks. The destructor typically handles
    internal bookkeeping such as clearing buffers, closing file handles, or notifying
    other systems about the tracker's destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker* tracker = new MLPerformanceTracker();

      // ... use the tracker ...

      delete tracker; // This calls ~MLPerformanceTracker()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocation Example
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    MLPerformanceTracker tracker; // Constructor\
      \ called\n    // ... perform tracking operations ...\n} // Destructor ~MLPerformanceTracker()\
      \ automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope or are deleted. Developers should ensure that no other code attempts
    to access the tracker after its destructor has been called, as this would result
    in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling the destructor manually on a stack-allocated object will result
    in double-destruction if the object goes out of scope afterward. Additionally,
    any references or pointers to this object should be invalidated immediately after
    destruction to prevent use-after-free errors.
