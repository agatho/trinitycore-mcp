  class: InstanceScript
  method: DoUseDoorOrButton
  signature: void InstanceScript::DoUseDoorOrButton(int guid, uint32 withRestoreTime,
    bool useAlternativeState)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a door or button GameObject in the instance, optionally restoring
    it after a specified time.
  description: The DoUseDoorOrButton method is used to interact with door or button
    GameObjects within an instance script. It triggers the object's activation state,
    which may include opening or closing doors, activating switches, or triggering
    other interactive elements. The method supports optional restoration of the object
    to its original state after a specified time interval, useful for temporary mechanisms
    like timed doors or buttons that reset automatically. This functionality is commonly
    used in dungeon and raid encounters where environmental interactions are required
    as part of the encounter mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the GameObject representing the door
      or button to be activated. This must correspond to a valid GameObject in the
      instance.
  - name: withRestoreTime
    description: The time in milliseconds after which the door or button should automatically
      restore to its original state. A value of 0 means no automatic restoration will
      occur.
  - name: useAlternativeState
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to use an alternative state for
      the object. If true, the object may enter a different visual or functional state
      than normal (e.g., a button that remains pressed).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Door Activation
    code: DoUseDoorOrButton(12345, 0, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Timed Button Activation with Restoration
    code: DoUseDoorOrButton(67890, 5000, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of an InstanceScript and relies on
    the GameObject being properly registered in the instance's data structures. The
    GUID must reference a valid GameObject that has been initialized in the current
    instance. The restoration mechanism uses the instance's timer system, so ensure
    proper timing values are used to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify
    that the GameObject exists and is properly initialized before calling this method.
    Using large restoration times may impact performance if many objects are being
    restored simultaneously.
