  brief: Updates and synchronizes quest data for the player's current quest pickup
    state
  description: The RefreshQuestData method is responsible for updating the internal
    quest data structures associated with a player's current quest pickup state. This
    method ensures that all quest-related information, such as quest objectives, progress
    tracking, and available rewards, are synchronized with the current game state.
    It typically gets invoked when a player interacts with quest givers or when quest
    states change dynamically during gameplay. The method operates on the QuestPickup
    object's internal data cache and may trigger updates to the player's quest log
    UI elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Refresh Usage
    code: "QuestPickup* pickup = player->GetQuestPickup();\nif (pickup)\n{\n    pickup->RefreshQuestData();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player's quest state has changed
    or when explicit synchronization is required. It may trigger UI updates and database
    writes internally, so frequent calls could impact performance.
  warnings: Calling this method in rapid succession without proper state checks may
    cause unnecessary resource consumption. Ensure that quest data changes have actually
    occurred before invoking this method.
