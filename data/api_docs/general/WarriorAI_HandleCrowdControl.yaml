  method: HandleCrowdControl
  signature: void WarriorAI::HandleCrowdControl()
documentation:
  brief: Handles crowd control effects for the warrior AI, managing interrupt and
    dispel actions.
  description: The HandleCrowdControl method in WarriorAI is responsible for managing
    how the AI responds to crowd control effects applied to the warrior. This includes
    determining when to use defensive abilities such as Shield Block or Spell Reflection
    to mitigate incoming interrupts or dispels. The method evaluates the current state
    of the warrior and the nature of the crowd control effect to decide on an appropriate
    counteraction strategy. It is typically invoked during combat updates when the
    AI detects that the warrior is under a crowd control effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    HandleCrowdControl();\n\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the warrior's defensive AI behavior and should be
    called regularly during combat updates. It assumes that the warrior has access
    to relevant defensive abilities and that the AI state is properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the warrior AI has valid target information before calling
    this method, as it may rely on the current victim or threat state to determine
    appropriate responses.
