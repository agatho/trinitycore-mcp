  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: RecordCalculationTime
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::RecordCalculationTime(uint64_t microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records the time taken to calculate a position strategy in microseconds
  description: The RecordCalculationTime method logs the duration of position calculation
    operations performed by the PositionStrategyBase class. This method is typically
    used for performance monitoring and debugging purposes within the TrinityCore
    AI system. It stores the provided microsecond value for tracking how long various
    positioning calculations take, which can help identify bottlenecks in pathfinding
    or movement logic. The recorded times are often used for statistical analysis
    to optimize NPC behavior and player movement systems.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The time duration of the calculation in microseconds. This value
      represents how long a position calculation took to complete, with higher values
      indicating slower performance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for recording calculation time
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase strategy;

      uint64_t calcTime = 1500; // 1.5 milliseconds

      strategy.RecordCalculationTime(calcTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording time after performing a complex position calculation
    code: 'auto startTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... complex positioning logic ...

      auto endTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      uint64_t duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(endTime
      - startTime).count();

      strategy.RecordCalculationTime(duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with performance profiling tools
    within TrinityCore. The recorded times may be aggregated or stored in internal
    buffers for later analysis. It's important to note that this method does not perform
    any validation on the input value, so invalid values (like negative numbers) could
    potentially cause issues if not handled properly elsewhere.
  warnings: Be cautious when recording very large time values as they might overflow
    or cause unexpected behavior in performance tracking systems. Ensure that timing
    measurements are accurate and consistent to maintain reliable performance data.
