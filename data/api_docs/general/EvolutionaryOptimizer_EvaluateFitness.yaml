  class: EvolutionaryOptimizer
  method: EvaluateFitness
  signature: void EvolutionaryOptimizer::EvaluateFitness(int fitnessFunc)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the fitness of individuals in the evolutionary optimization process
    using the specified fitness function.
  description: The EvaluateFitness method performs fitness assessment on the current
    population within the EvolutionaryOptimizer class. It applies the selected fitness
    function (determined by the fitnessFunc parameter) to calculate fitness values
    for each individual in the population. This method is typically called during
    the evolutionary algorithm's evaluation phase, where individuals are scored based
    on how well they solve the given problem. The method updates internal fitness
    tracking data structures and may trigger selection mechanisms based on the calculated
    fitness values. It serves as a core component of the evolutionary optimization
    loop, enabling the algorithm to determine which individuals should be selected
    for reproduction.
  parameters:
  - name: fitnessFunc
    description: Identifier specifying which fitness function to use for evaluation.
      Valid values typically correspond to predefined fitness function indices or
      enums within the EvolutionaryOptimizer class. The exact range of valid values
      depends on the implementation and may include constants like FITNESS_FUNC_1,
      FITNESS_FUNC_2, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fitness Evaluation
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.EvaluateFitness(0); // Evaluate using the first fitness function'
    language: cpp
  - title: Evaluating with Different Fitness Functions
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      // Evaluate population using different fitness functions

      optimizer.EvaluateFitness(FITNESS_FUNC_1);

      optimizer.EvaluateFitness(FITNESS_FUNC_2);

      optimizer.EvaluateFitness(FITNESS_FUNC_3);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the population has been properly initialized and
    that individuals contain the necessary data for fitness calculation. The method
    modifies internal state variables related to fitness tracking and should only
    be called after population initialization. Performance may vary depending on the
    complexity of the fitness function implementation.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper population initialization may result
    in undefined behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that the fitnessFunc parameter
    is within valid range for the specific implementation, as invalid values could
    cause assertion failures or incorrect evaluation results.
