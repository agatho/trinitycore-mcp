documentation:
  brief: Modifies player's currency amount by specified value
  description: The ModifyCurrency method allows players to adjust their currency values,
    such as honor points or arena points, by a given amount. This method is commonly
    used in game mechanics to add or remove currency from a player's inventory. It
    supports both positive and negative adjustments, making it useful for various
    game events including PvP rewards, quest rewards, or custom modifications. The
    method also handles different gain sources and destroy reasons to properly track
    how currency was acquired or lost.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The currency ID to modify, typically representing a specific type
      of currency such as honor points or arena points
  - name: amount
    description: The amount by which to modify the currency, positive for adding and
      negative for removing
  - name: gainSource
    description: The source of gain, used to track how currency was acquired (e.g.,
      PvP, quest rewards)
  - name: destroyReason
    description: The reason for destruction, used to track how currency was lost (e.g.,
      PvP loss, item destruction)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Currency Modification Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ModifyCurrency(2345, 100, 1, 2);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Currency Modification Example
    code: '// Add currency with specific gain source and destroy reason

      Player* player = new Player();

      player->ModifyCurrency(2345, 50, 1, 2);

      // Remove currency with different parameters

      player->ModifyCurrency(2345, -20, 0, 3);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player-related methods
    to maintain currency balance. It should be used carefully as it can affect game
    mechanics such as PvP rankings or quest completion. Performance considerations
    include potential updates to player's inventory and UI notifications.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect currency tracking, especially
    when dealing with gainSource and destroyReason parameters. Always ensure that
    the currency ID is valid and that the amount is correctly interpreted for both
    positive and negative values.
