  method: GetDamageMultiplier
  signature: float WindwalkerHitComboTracker::GetDamageMultiplier() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the damage multiplier applied by the Windwalker hit
    combo system.
  description: The GetDamageMultiplier method retrieves the current damage multiplier
    value that is applied to attacks within the Windwalker class's combo system. This
    multiplier is typically used in conjunction with martial arts abilities and combo
    point systems to determine enhanced damage output. The returned value represents
    a scalar factor that modifies base attack damage, with typical values ranging
    from 1.0 (no bonus) to higher multipliers based on combo state and ability usage.
    This method does not modify internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current damage multiplier. A value of 1.0
    indicates no bonus damage, while values greater than 1.0 indicate increased damage
    output due to combo effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float multiplier = windwalkerTracker->GetDamageMultiplier();\nif (multiplier\
      \ > 1.0f)\n{\n    // Apply enhanced damage logic\n    damage *= multiplier;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Calculation
    code: "void ApplyWindwalkerDamageBoost(Unit* attacker, Unit* victim)\n{\n    WindwalkerHitComboTracker*\
      \ tracker = GetWindwalkerComboTracker(attacker);\n    if (tracker)\n    {\n\
      \        float multiplier = tracker->GetDamageMultiplier();\n        uint32\
      \ baseDamage = CalculateBaseDamage(attacker, victim);\n        uint32 finalDamage\
      \ = static_cast<uint32>(baseDamage * multiplier);\n        // Apply finalDamage\
      \ to victim\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during damage calculation phases of combat.
    The returned value may vary dynamically based on the player's current combo state,
    active abilities, and talent selections. It is recommended to cache this value
    if it will be used multiple times within a single combat calculation cycle.
  warnings: Do not assume that this multiplier will always be greater than 1.0; it
    can return 1.0 when no combo effects are active. Also, ensure that the WindwalkerHitComboTracker
    instance is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
