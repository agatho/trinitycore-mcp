  method: GetReactState
  signature: int Creature::GetReactState() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the reaction state of the creature to players.
  description: The GetReactState method retrieves the current react state of a creature,
    which determines how the creature responds to player actions. This state controls
    whether the creature will attack, follow, or remain neutral towards players. The
    method is commonly used in AI scripts and quest handling to determine creature
    behavior based on player interaction. It returns an integer value representing
    one of several predefined states including passive, aggressive, defensive, or
    friendly reactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the creature's react state. Possible
    values include 0 (passive), 1 (aggressive), 2 (defensive), and 3 (friendly). The
    specific value depends on the creature's current AI state and behavior configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int reactState = creature->GetReactState();\nif (reactState == 1)\n{\n\
      \    // Creature is aggressive\n    // Handle attack logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the creature's AI system and should be used carefully
    when implementing custom behavior. The react state can be modified through various
    methods like SetReactState or by changing creature's AI flags. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this is a simple getter method.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other AI-related
    functions, as improper handling may lead to unexpected creature behavior. Also
    note that the react state might be influenced by player's reputation and other
    factors.
