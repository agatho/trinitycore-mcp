  signature: void WaypointMgr::LoadPathNodesFromDB(const PathNodeQueryResult & fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads waypoint path nodes from the database into memory for creature movement.
  description: The LoadPathNodesFromDB method retrieves all waypoint path node records
    from the database and populates internal data structures used for creature movement.
    This method is typically invoked during server startup or when a creature's waypoints
    need to be reloaded from the database. It processes the PathNodeQueryResult data,
    which contains serialized waypoint information including node IDs, creature GUIDs,
    positions, and movement parameters. The loaded path nodes are stored in memory
    and made available for pathfinding and movement execution by the AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::LoadAllWaypointPaths()\n{\n    // Assuming WaypointMgr\
      \ is a singleton\n    sWaypointMgr->LoadPathNodesFromDB();\n}\n\n// Called internally\
      \ by the server startup process"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the relevant tables are populated. It's typically invoked during server initialization
    or when reloading waypoint data dynamically. The method assumes that PathNodeQueryResult
    contains valid data from the database query results.
  warnings: Calling this method while creatures are actively following paths may cause
    undefined behavior or movement glitches. This method should be called in a safe
    context where no creature movement is occurring, or it should be thread-locked
    to prevent race conditions.
