  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: IsDynamicDistribution
  signature: bool BotLevelDistribution::IsDynamicDistribution() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot level distribution is dynamically adjusted based
    on current server conditions.
  description: The IsDynamicDistribution method checks if the bot level distribution
    system is currently operating in a dynamic mode, where bot levels are adjusted
    according to real-time server metrics such as player population, difficulty settings,
    or other environmental factors. This allows for adaptive gameplay experiences
    that respond to changing conditions. The method returns true when dynamic adjustments
    are enabled and false when the distribution uses fixed or static level configurations.
    This functionality is typically used in automated bot management systems within
    TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot level distribution is currently using dynamic adjustment
    logic; otherwise returns false if using a static configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Check Dynamic Distribution Status
    code: "BotLevelDistribution* distribution = sObjectMgr->GetBotLevelDistribution();\n\
      if (distribution->IsDynamicDistribution()) {\n    printf(\"Bot levels are dynamically\
      \ adjusted\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Bot levels use static configuration\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or when evaluating
    the current state of the bot management system. It's important to note that dynamic
    distribution may have performance implications during high server load periods
    as it requires additional calculations for level adjustments.
