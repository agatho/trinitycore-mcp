  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::IsGroupFormationActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group formation behavior is currently active for the
    leader follower system.
  description: The IsGroupFormationActive method checks if the current leader-follower
    behavior in the game is actively managing group formation. This typically relates
    to whether the AI system is enforcing specific positioning or movement patterns
    for group members following a leader. The method returns true when the system
    is actively controlling group formation, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is commonly used in AI-driven group behaviors such as escort quests, scripted
    group movements, or dynamic formation management during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group formation behavior is currently active and managing
    leader-follower positioning; returns false if group formation is not active or
    has been disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Group Formation is Active
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior.IsGroupFormationActive()) {\n    // Perform actions\
      \ specific to active group formation\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\", \"Group formation\
      \ is currently active\");\n} else {\n    // Handle case when group formation\
      \ is not active\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\", \"Group formation is not active\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to determine if the
    current behavior should enforce formation rules. It may be influenced by external
    factors such as quest states, combat status, or player actions that could disable
    or enable group formation.
