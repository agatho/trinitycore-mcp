  signature: void LootDistribution::BroadcastLootRoll(Group * group, const LootRoll
    & roll)
documentation:
  brief: Broadcasts a loot roll to all members of a group.
  description: The BroadcastLootRoll method sends a loot roll notification to all
    players within the specified group. This function is typically used during loot
    distribution when a player rolls for an item, and it ensures that all group members
    are informed about the roll outcome. The method handles the communication of roll
    results through the game's network layer, updating each player's client with the
    relevant loot information. It is commonly invoked in the context of group loot
    systems such as round-robin or master loot distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will receive
      the loot roll broadcast. Must not be null.
  - name: roll
    description: Reference to a LootRoll object that contains the details of the current
      loot roll, including item information and player rolls.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a loot roll for a group
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootRoll roll;

      // ... populate roll with item and player data ...

      lootDistribution->BroadcastLootRoll(group, roll);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is valid and contains at least one member.
    It internally handles serialization of the roll data for network transmission
    to all players in the group.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, verify
    that the LootRoll object has been properly initialized with correct item and player
    information.
