  class: Player
  method: SetCanBlock
  signature: void Player::SetCanBlock(bool value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the player can block incoming attacks.
  description: The SetCanBlock method controls whether a player is able to block incoming
    melee attacks with their shield. This method affects the player's block chance
    and is typically used during combat or when setting up specific gameplay scenarios.
    The method directly influences the player's ability to reduce damage from melee
    attacks by blocking them, which is an important aspect of tanking mechanics in
    World of Warcraft. When set to true, the player can block attacks; when set to
    false, they cannot block attacks.
  parameters:
  - name: value
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the player should be able to block
      incoming attacks. True enables blocking, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetCanBlock(true);

      // Player can now block incoming attacks'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Scenario Example
    code: "void setupCombat()\n{\n    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n    player->SetCanBlock(false);\n\
      \    // Disable blocking during certain combat phases\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other block-related mechanics
    such as Block Chance, Shield Block, and Combat stance changes. The implementation
    may involve updates to the player's combat attributes and requires proper synchronization
    of game state.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in combat,
    especially if not properly synchronized with other block-related systems. Care
    should be taken when setting this value during active combat or when using it
    in conjunction with other blocking mechanics.
