  method: GetPreparedStatement
  signature: int * PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::GetPreparedStatement(int statementId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a prepared SQL statement by its identifier for use in player bot
    character database operations.
  description: The GetPreparedStatement method is used to fetch a precompiled SQL
    statement from the player bot character database interface. This method allows
    access to optimized database queries that have been previously prepared for performance
    reasons. The returned statement can be used with the database connection to execute
    parameterized queries efficiently. It's commonly used within the TrinityCore player
    bot system to manage character data operations such as saving, loading, or updating
    bot character information in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer representing the prepared statement identifier.
    The value is typically used internally by the database interface to reference
    precompiled SQL statements. A null pointer may be returned if the statement ID
    is invalid or if preparation failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetPreparedStatement
    code: "int* stmt = playerbotDbInterface->GetPreparedStatement(PLAYERBOT_STATEMENT_LOAD_CHARACTER);\n\
      if (stmt != nullptr) {\n    // Use the prepared statement for database operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the database interface abstraction layer in TrinityCore's
    player bot system. Prepared statements are cached and reused to improve performance
    when executing similar queries multiple times. The method assumes that the statement
    ID has been properly registered with the database interface before calling.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or free the returned pointer as it points to
    internal database resources. Always check for null return values before using
    the prepared statement. Incorrect statement IDs may cause undefined behavior or
    database errors.
