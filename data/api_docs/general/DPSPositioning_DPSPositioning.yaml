documentation:
  brief: Configures and executes DPS positioning logic based on provided configuration
    settings
  description: The DPSPositioning method initializes and applies specific positioning
    behaviors for DPS characters within the TrinityCore framework. This method takes
    a DPSPositionConfig object that defines various parameters such as target selection
    criteria, positioning thresholds, and movement strategies. The implementation
    likely integrates with the core AI system to dynamically adjust character positioning
    during combat scenarios, ensuring optimal damage output while maintaining survivability.
    It may involve pathfinding calculations, threat management, and coordination with
    other AI modules to achieve desired positioning outcomes.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: A DPSPositionConfig object containing all necessary parameters for
      configuring the DPS positioning behavior including target selection rules, distance
      thresholds, movement preferences, and combat positioning strategies
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DPS Positioning Configuration
    code: 'DPSPositionConfig config;

      config.targetDistance = 5.0f;

      config.minDistance = 1.0f;

      config.maxDistance = 8.0f;

      config.usePathfinding = true;

      player->DPSPositioning(config);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced DPS Positioning with Custom Strategy
    code: 'DPSPositionConfig advancedConfig;

      advancedConfig.targetDistance = 10.0f;

      advancedConfig.minDistance = 3.0f;

      advancedConfig.maxDistance = 15.0f;

      advancedConfig.usePathfinding = true;

      advancedConfig.allowMovement = false;

      advancedConfig.positioningStrategy = POSITIONING_STRATEGY_FOLLOW;

      player->DPSPositioning(advancedConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat AI updates and may trigger
    pathfinding calculations that could impact performance. The configuration object
    should be properly initialized before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
    Implementation likely involves integration with the existing AI subsystem and
    may interact with threat tables and target selection logic.
  warnings: Improperly configured positioning parameters can lead to characters getting
    stuck in walls or failing to maintain optimal combat positions. This method should
    only be called during active combat scenarios when the character has a valid target.
    Avoid calling this method from multiple threads simultaneously without proper
    synchronization.
