  class: HostileEventHooks
  method: IsRelevantHostile
  signature: bool HostileEventHooks::IsRelevantHostile(int * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a hostile unit is relevant for event processing in the
    HostileEventHooks system.
  description: The IsRelevantHostile method evaluates whether a given hostile unit
    meets specific criteria to be considered relevant for hostile event handling within
    the TrinityCore framework. This typically involves checking if the unit is currently
    engaged in combat, has a valid threat state, or satisfies other conditions that
    make it worthy of hostile event notifications. The method is used by the HostileEventHooks
    system to filter out irrelevant hostile units and ensure only pertinent entities
    trigger hostile-related events. It serves as a crucial filtering mechanism for
    performance optimization and accurate event dispatching in player versus creature
    interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unit identifier (GUID) of
      the hostile entity being evaluated. This parameter is expected to point to a
      valid unit within the game world context.
  returns: Returns true if the hostile unit is considered relevant for event processing,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the unit meets all necessary
    conditions to be included in hostile event handling, while false suggests it should
    be ignored during such processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in hostile event handler
    code: "if (hooks.IsRelevantHostile(&hostileGuid)) {\n    // Process hostile event\
      \ for this unit\n    HandleHostileEvent(hostileGuid);\n} else {\n    // Skip\
      \ irrelevant hostile units\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state checking
    code: "bool IsRelevantHostile(int* unit) {\n    if (!unit || *unit == 0) return\
      \ false;\n    Unit* u = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*unit);\n    if (!u || !u->IsInWorld())\
      \ return false;\n    if (u->HasFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NON_ATTACKABLE))\
      \ return false;\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during hostile event processing loops and
    should be optimized for performance as it may be invoked frequently. The method
    assumes that the input unit pointer points to a valid GUID value within the game
    world context. It's recommended to validate the unit's existence and state before
    calling this method to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: The parameter 'unit' must point to a valid integer representing a unit
    GUID; passing null or invalid pointers can lead to crashes or incorrect behavior.
    This method should not be used outside of the HostileEventHooks context without
    proper validation, as it relies on internal game state assumptions.
