documentation:
  brief: Commits the learning session, finalizing any changes made during the scoped
    learning period.
  description: The Commit method finalizes a scoped learning session by applying all
    pending changes and ensuring that the learning state is properly persisted. This
    method is typically invoked at the end of a learning operation to make sure that
    any modifications to the learning context are saved. It may also trigger cleanup
    operations or notifications related to the completion of the learning process.
    The method does not accept any parameters and does not return a value, making
    it a simple state transition operation.

  - title: Basic Commit Usage
    code: 'ScopedLearningSession session;

      // Perform learning operations...

      session.Commit(); // Finalize the learning session'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a learning session has been properly
    initialized and during which learning operations have occurred. Calling Commit
    without prior setup may result in undefined behavior or errors.
