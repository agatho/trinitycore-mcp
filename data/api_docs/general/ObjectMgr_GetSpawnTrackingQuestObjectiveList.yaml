  method: GetSpawnTrackingQuestObjectiveList
  signature: const int * ObjectMgr::GetSpawnTrackingQuestObjectiveList(uint32 spawnTrackingId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of quest objective IDs associated with a specified spawn
    tracking ID.
  description: This method fetches a constant array of integers representing quest
    objectives that are linked to a given spawn tracking identifier. Spawn tracking
    is used in World of Warcraft to monitor and manage the spawning of game entities
    such as NPCs or objects, often tied to specific quest progress. The returned integer
    list typically contains quest objective IDs which are used by the core to determine
    when certain conditions for quest progression have been met. This method does
    not modify any data but provides read-only access to internal tracking structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a constant array of integers (int*), where each integer represents
    a quest objective ID associated with the specified spawn tracking ID. The array
    is null-terminated and should be treated as read-only. If no objectives are found
    for the given spawn tracking ID, the method may return a null pointer or an empty
    array depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Quest Objectives for Spawn Tracking
    code: "const int* questObjectives = sObjectMgr->GetSpawnTrackingQuestObjectiveList(12345);\n\
      if (questObjectives != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; questObjectives[i] !=\
      \ 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Quest Objective ID: %d\\n\", questObjectives[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is managed internally by the ObjectMgr and must not be
    modified or freed by calling code. It's recommended to check for null before using
    the result, as some spawn tracking IDs might not have associated quest objectives.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spawnTrackingId may lead to undefined
    behavior or return unexpected results. Ensure that the spawnTrackingId is valid
    and corresponds to existing tracked spawns in the database.
