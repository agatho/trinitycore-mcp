  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: BotPopulationManager
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::BotPopulationManager()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotPopulationManager class.
  description: The BotPopulationManager constructor initializes the internal state
    and data structures required for managing bot populations within the TrinityCore
    environment. This method sets up necessary tracking mechanisms, configuration
    defaults, and prepares the manager to handle bot creation, population control,
    and lifecycle management. The initialization process typically involves setting
    up internal containers, loading default configurations, and preparing system hooks
    or callbacks needed for bot population dynamics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a BotPopulationManager instance
    code: 'BotPopulationManager* manager = new BotPopulationManager();

      // The manager is now ready to manage bot populations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per manager instance. Multiple
    instantiations may lead to resource conflicts or undefined behavior. The initialization
    process is lightweight but does require access to core TrinityCore systems for
    proper configuration loading.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly in a multithreaded environment without
    proper synchronization. Ensure that the TrinityCore core is fully initialized
    before creating any BotPopulationManager instances.
