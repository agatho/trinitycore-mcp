documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild roster packet to the player's client containing information
    about all guild members.
  description: The HandleGuildGetRoster method processes an incoming request from
    a player's client to retrieve the current guild roster. This function is typically
    invoked when a player opens their guild window or requests guild member information.
    It gathers data about each guild member including name, rank, online status, and
    other relevant details, then constructs and sends a GuildRoster packet back to
    the requesting player. The method ensures that only players who are members of
    the same guild as the requesting player receive the roster information. This function
    plays a crucial role in maintaining guild communication and organization within
    the World of Warcraft game environment.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildGetRoster(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildGetRoster&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Method implementation would fetch guild data and send roster\
      \ packet\n    // This is typically called internally by the server's packet\
      \ handling system\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet handling system and is automatically
    invoked when a client sends a GuildGetRoster request. The implementation relies
    on the player's current guild membership to determine what data to send. Performance
    considerations include limiting the number of players in a guild to avoid excessive
    memory usage during roster construction.
