  brief: Tests the concurrency of Intel TBB (Threading Building Blocks) within the
    TrinityCore environment
  description: The TestTBBConcurrency method validates that the Intel Threading Building
    Blocks library is properly initialized and functioning within the TrinityCore
    server. This method performs a basic concurrency test by creating multiple threads
    that perform simple operations to verify thread safety and proper TBB integration.
    It is typically used during server startup or configuration validation to ensure
    that multi-threaded operations can be safely executed. The method returns true
    if all concurrency tests pass successfully, indicating that the threading infrastructure
    is operational, or false if any issues are detected with the TBB implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all Intel TBB concurrency tests pass successfully, indicating
    proper thread initialization and operation. Returns false if any concurrency test
    fails, suggesting potential issues with the threading library or configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Concurrency Test Usage
    code: "if (sDependencyValidator->TestTBBConcurrency()) {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"server.loading\"\
      , \"Intel TBB concurrency test passed\");\n} else {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"server.loading\"\
      , \"Intel TBB concurrency test failed - server may not function properly\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during server initialization to validate that
    the threading infrastructure is properly configured. It should be called before
    any multi-threaded operations are initiated. The test creates a small number of
    threads to verify basic functionality without heavy resource usage.
  warnings: If this method returns false, it may indicate that the TrinityCore server
    will not function correctly with multi-threaded operations. This could lead to
    performance issues or crashes in areas that rely on concurrent processing. Ensure
    TBB libraries are properly linked and configured before relying on this test.
