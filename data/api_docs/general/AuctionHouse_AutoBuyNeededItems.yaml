documentation:
  brief: Processes automatic purchasing of needed auction items for a player
  description: The AutoBuyNeededItems method handles the logic for automatically buying
    auction house items that a player has set up as auto-buy triggers. This functionality
    allows players to configure their auction house settings to automatically purchase
    specific items when they meet certain criteria, such as price thresholds or item
    types. The method iterates through the player's auto-buy configuration and attempts
    to purchase qualifying items from the auction house. It typically runs during
    periodic updates or when new auctions are posted that match the player's configured
    preferences.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) for whom auto-buy operations should be performed
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auto-Buy Trigger
    code: 'AuctionHouse auctionHouse;

      int playerId = 12345;

      auctionHouse.AutoBuyNeededItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's auction house auto-buy settings
    stored in the database. It may perform multiple database queries and auction house
    operations during execution, so performance could be impacted by high auction
    volumes or complex auto-buy configurations.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it takes a pointer to an integer, which
    might be a GUID or index value. Ensure proper validation of the player ID before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior or database corruption.
