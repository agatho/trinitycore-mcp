  class: BlackMarketMgr
  method: AddTemplate
  signature: void BlackMarketMgr::AddTemplate(BlackMarketTemplate * templ)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a black market template to the manager's internal collection.
  description: The AddTemplate method is responsible for registering a BlackMarketTemplate
    object with the BlackMarketMgr instance. This allows the black market system to
    manage and utilize the provided template for generating auction items. The method
    typically handles the insertion of the template into an internal data structure
    such as a container or map, ensuring that the template can be retrieved later
    during black market operations. It is usually called during server initialization
    or when new black market items are added dynamically.
  parameters:
  - name: templ
    description: A pointer to the BlackMarketTemplate object to be added. This must
      be a valid, initialized template instance with proper data populated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Basic Black Market Template
    code: 'BlackMarketTemplate* newTemplate = new BlackMarketTemplate();

      // Populate the template with item data...

      blackMarketMgr->AddTemplate(newTemplate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs no validation on the input template; it is assumed
    that the caller ensures the template is valid before passing it. The internal
    storage mechanism (e.g., std::map, std::vector) used by BlackMarketMgr should
    be considered for performance implications when adding many templates.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Ensure that all templates passed to AddTemplate are properly
    allocated and initialized before calling.
