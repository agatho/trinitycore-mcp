  class: LootEventBus
  method: ValidateEvent
  signature: bool LootEventBus::ValidateEvent(const LootEvent & event) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a loot event is properly configured and meets all required
    criteria for processing.
  description: The ValidateEvent method checks if a given LootEvent object contains
    valid data and adheres to all necessary constraints required for loot distribution
    within the TrinityCore framework. This includes verifying that essential fields
    such as item IDs, player references, and event types are correctly set and within
    acceptable ranges. The method ensures that invalid or malformed loot events do
    not proceed to cause errors during the loot distribution process. It is typically
    called before attempting to process a loot event to prevent runtime issues and
    maintain game integrity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the LootEvent is valid and meets all required criteria;
    otherwise, returns false if any validation check fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "LootEvent event;\n// ... populate event with data ...\nif (lootEventBus.ValidateEvent(event))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with loot processing\n    lootEventBus.ProcessEvent(event);\n\
      } else {\n    // Log invalid event or handle error\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid\
      \ loot event detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a comprehensive validation of the LootEvent structure,
    including checking for null pointers, valid item IDs, proper player references,
    and correct event type enumerations. It's designed to be lightweight but thorough
    to avoid unnecessary performance overhead during high-frequency loot operations.
  warnings: Do not assume that all LootEvent objects passed to this method are valid.
    Always validate before attempting to process events to prevent potential crashes
    or inconsistent game state.
