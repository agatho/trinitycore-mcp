documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the current target's unique identifier (GUID) for the
    target selector.
  description: The GetCurrentTarget method retrieves the unique identifier of the
    currently selected target within the TargetSelector class. This identifier is
    typically used in World of Warcraft AI systems to track and manage which unit
    or player is being targeted by an NPC or creature. The returned pointer points
    to an integer value representing the GUID of the target. It's important to note
    that this method returns a raw pointer, so callers must ensure the target remains
    valid during the lifetime of the returned pointer. If no target is currently selected,
    the method may return nullptr or a default/invalid GUID value depending on implementation
    details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    current target. Returns nullptr if no target is selected or if the target is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check current target
    code: "int* currentTarget = selector->GetCurrentTarget();\nif (currentTarget !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    uint64 targetGuid = *currentTarget;\n    // Use the target\
      \ GUID for further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using current target in AI decision making
    code: "int* targetPtr = selector->GetCurrentTarget();\nif (targetPtr != nullptr\
      \ && *targetPtr != 0)\n{\n    // Perform actions based on the current target\n\
      \    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*targetPtr);\n    if (target &&\
      \ target->IsAlive())\n    {\n        // Continue attacking or following the\
      \ target\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI scripts for creatures and NPCs to determine
    their current target. The returned pointer should not be modified directly as
    it points to internal state data. Be aware that if the target changes or becomes
    invalid, subsequent calls may return different values or nullptr.
  warnings: The returned pointer is only valid during the lifetime of the TargetSelector
    instance and its current target. Using the pointer after the target has changed
    or been destroyed can lead to undefined behavior. Always check for null before
    dereferencing the returned pointer.
