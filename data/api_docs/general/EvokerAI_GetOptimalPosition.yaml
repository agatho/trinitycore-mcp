  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int EvokerAI::GetOptimalPosition(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position for an evoker to cast spells
    or perform actions.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best location for an EvokerAI-controlled
    NPC to position itself during combat or spellcasting. This method evaluates various
    factors such as target distance, line of sight, spell range, and environmental
    obstacles to compute an ideal position. It is typically used by evoker NPCs to
    optimize their positioning strategy for maximum effectiveness and safety. The
    returned value represents a calculated index or identifier that corresponds to
    a specific strategic location within the AI's decision-making framework.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity ID. This parameter
      is used to determine optimal positioning relative to the target for spell casting
      or movement purposes.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the calculated optimal position index.
    A positive value typically signifies a valid strategic location, while zero or
    negative values may indicate failure to calculate a suitable position due to constraints
    or invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetOptimalPosition
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nint optimalPos = evokerAI->GetOptimalPosition(&targetId);\n\
      if (optimalPos > 0) {\n    // Proceed with movement or spell casting to the\
      \ calculated position\n    printf(\"Optimal position: %d\\n\", optimalPos);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where no valid position was found\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to determine optimal position\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal AI pathfinding and spell targeting
    systems. It may cache previous calculations for performance reasons, especially
    in high-frequency combat situations. The actual implementation details depend
    on the specific evoker class behavior and spell mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid entity ID before calling
    this method. Invalid or null targets may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    positioning decisions. This method should not be called during critical AI state
    transitions without proper synchronization.
