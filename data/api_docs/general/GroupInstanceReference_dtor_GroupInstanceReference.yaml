documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupInstanceReference object and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GroupInstanceReference class is responsible
    for releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance.
    In the context of TrinityCore's group management system, this typically involves
    cleaning up references to group instances and ensuring proper resource deallocation
    when a GroupInstanceReference object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    This method ensures that no memory leaks occur and that the internal state of
    the group reference is properly reset.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of GroupInstanceReference
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    GroupInstanceReference* ref = new GroupInstanceReference();\n\
      \    // ... use the reference ...\n    delete ref; // Triggers ~GroupInstanceReference()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a GroupInstanceReference object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless performing
    explicit memory management. The implementation likely handles cleanup of internal
    data structures related to group instance references.
