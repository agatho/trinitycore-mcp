  method: GetDamage
  signature: int32 PetAura::GetDamage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the damage value of the pet aura.
  description: The GetDamage method retrieves the calculated damage value associated
    with a PetAura instance. This method is typically used in the context of pet abilities
    or spells that deal damage, where the aura represents a specific effect applied
    to the pet. The returned value reflects the computed damage amount based on various
    factors such as pet level, aura properties, and any modifiers that may be applied.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the calculated damage dealt by the pet aura.
    This value can be positive (indicating damage), zero (no damage), or negative
    (potentially indicating healing or other effects depending on context).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PetAura* aura = player->GetPet()->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    int32\
      \ damage = aura->GetDamage();\n    // Use the damage value for further processing\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the PetAura instance has already been initialized
    with appropriate data. The actual damage calculation logic may depend on internal
    aura properties and game mechanics such as pet stats, spell modifiers, or level
    scaling.
  warnings: Ensure that the PetAura object is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. If the aura hasn't been properly initialized or configured,
    the returned value might not reflect expected results.
