documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit is prohibited from using a specific mount form.
  description: This method checks if a unit (such as a player or creature) is disallowed
    from using a particular mount form based on spell ID, form type, and display ID.
    It evaluates the unit's state to determine if they can mount or not, considering
    various game mechanics like aura effects, form restrictions, and display conditions.
    The method is commonly used in mount-related logic to enforce restrictions or
    allow/disallow specific mount forms.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is disallowed from using the specified mount form;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: bool result = unit->IsDisallowedMountForm(12345, 1, 67890);
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method likely checks against active
    auras or form restrictions that prevent mounting. Performance considerations may
    arise from frequent calls during mount logic processing.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may impact gameplay mechanics
    involving mounts, especially in scenarios where multiple forms are involved.
