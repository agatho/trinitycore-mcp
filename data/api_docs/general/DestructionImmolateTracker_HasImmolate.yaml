  method: HasImmolate
  signature: bool DestructionImmolateTracker::HasImmolate(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific unit has the Immolate spell effect applied.
  description: The HasImmolate method determines whether a given unit, identified
    by its GUID, currently has the Immolate spell active on it. This is typically
    used in destruction warlock AI logic to track the status of enemy targets and
    make decisions based on whether they are afflicted with Immolate. The method performs
    a lookup within the tracker's internal data structure to verify the presence of
    the spell effect for the specified unit.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit to check for Immolate status.
      This should be a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  returns: Returns true if the specified unit has the Immolate spell effect applied;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (tracker.HasImmolate(targetGuid)) {\n    // Target is already immolated,\
      \ skip applying it again\n    return;\n}\n// Apply Immolate to target\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with unit selection logic
    code: "Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_NEAREST, 0, 10.0f, true);\nif\
      \ (target && !tracker.HasImmolate(target->GetGUID())) {\n    // Cast Immolate\
      \ on target\n    DoCast(target, SPELL_IMMOLATE);\n    tracker.AddImmolate(target->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the DestructionImmolateTracker maintains an internal
    collection of GUIDs representing units with active Immolate effects. The implementation
    likely uses a set or map for efficient lookups, making the check O(log n) or O(1)
    depending on the underlying container type.
