documentation:
  brief: Processes the currently active gathering activity for a player, updating
    resource counts and triggering related events.
  description: The ProcessCurrentGathering method handles the core logic for managing
    a player's active gathering session. It typically updates the player's inventory
    with newly collected resources, checks for quest progress or achievement completion,
    and may trigger visual effects or sound cues. This method is often called when
    a player finishes gathering a resource or when a gathering timer expires. The
    method does not take any parameters and performs its operations on the current
    gathering state maintained by the GatheringManager instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Gathering Context
    code: 'GatheringManager* manager = player->GetGatheringManager();

      manager->ProcessCurrentGathering();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the game loop or event
    system when a gathering session completes. Developers should ensure that any custom
    gathering logic is properly integrated with this method to maintain consistency
    in resource tracking and player feedback.
