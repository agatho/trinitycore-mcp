documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the amount of money attached to the mail draft
  description: The GetMoney method returns the quantity of copper coins that have
    been attached to a mail draft. This value represents the monetary compensation
    or payment that will be sent along with the mail when it is delivered to the recipient.
    The returned value is expressed in copper coins, which is the smallest unit of
    currency in World of Warcraft. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    MailDraft::AddMoney() to set and retrieve monetary amounts for in-game mail systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the amount of money (in copper) attached to
    this mail draft. Returns 0 if no money has been added to the draft.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve money from a mail draft
    code: 'MailDraft draft("Subject", "Body");

      draft.AddMoney(1000); // Add 1000 copper (1 silver)

      uint64 money = draft.GetMoney(); // Returns 1000

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if mail draft contains money before sending
    code: "MailDraft draft(\"Quest Reward\", \"Here is your reward\");\n// Add some\
      \ gold to the mail\nuint64 gold = 50000; // 50 gold in copper\ndraft.AddMoney(gold);\n\
      if (draft.GetMoney() > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with sending the mail that includes\
      \ money\n    draft.SendMailTo(...);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns the total amount of money added to the draft, regardless
    of how it was added (directly or through AddMoney). The returned value is always
    in copper coins as per World of Warcraft's currency system. This method does not
    validate whether the money amount is within acceptable limits for mail delivery.
  warnings: Be aware that if no money has been added to the draft using AddMoney(),
    this method will return 0, which might be misinterpreted as an intentional zero-value
    payment rather than a missing value. Always ensure proper initialization of mail
    drafts before relying on GetMoney().
