  class: PerformanceProfile
  method: CalculateMetric
  signature: float PerformanceProfile::CalculateMetric(PerformanceMetric metric) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a performance metric value based on internal profiling
    data.
  description: The CalculateMetric method computes a specific performance metric from
    collected profiling data within the PerformanceProfile class. This method is typically
    used to evaluate system performance, resource usage, or execution efficiency in
    various game subsystems such as AI behavior, movement calculations, or server
    responsiveness. The calculation may involve averaging, weighting, or other statistical
    operations on stored performance measurements. The method does not modify any
    internal state and is designed to be called during profiling sessions or performance
    analysis tasks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated performance metric. The specific
    meaning of this value depends on the PerformanceMetric enum value passed to the
    method, which determines how the internal data is processed to produce the result.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceProfile profile;

      // ... populate profile with data ...

      float cpuUsage = profile.CalculateMetric(PerformanceMetric::CPU_USAGE);

      printf("CPU Usage: %.2f%%\n", cpuUsage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring system in TrinityCore.
    It should be called after sufficient profiling data has been collected to ensure
    meaningful results. The implementation may cache calculated values for performance
    reasons, but this behavior is not guaranteed.
  warnings: The method assumes that valid profiling data exists within the PerformanceProfile
    instance. Calling it without prior data collection may result in undefined behavior
    or inaccurate metrics. Additionally, since this is a const method, it cannot modify
    internal state, so any metric calculation must be based solely on existing data.
