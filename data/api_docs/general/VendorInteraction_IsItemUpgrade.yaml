  class: VendorInteraction
  method: IsItemUpgrade
  signature: bool VendorInteraction::IsItemUpgrade(Player * bot, uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified item is an upgrade for the player's current
    equipment.
  description: The IsItemUpgrade method evaluates if a given item provides an improvement
    over the player's currently equipped items in terms of stats, quality, or level.
    This function is typically used during vendor interactions to determine which
    items should be considered for purchase or replacement. It checks against the
    player's existing inventory and equipped gear to make this determination. The
    method does not consider item availability or affordability; it only assesses
    whether the item would be an upgrade in terms of performance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player whose
      equipment is being compared against.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being evaluated for upgrade status.
  returns: Returns true if the specified item offers an improvement over any currently
    equipped item, false otherwise. This includes cases where the item is better in
    terms of stats, quality, or level compared to existing gear.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Item is Upgrade for Player
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player instance\nuint32 itemId = 12345; //\
      \ Example item ID\nbool isUpgrade = VendorInteraction::IsItemUpgrade(player,\
      \ itemId);\nif (isUpgrade)\n{\n    // Proceed with purchasing or equipping the\
      \ item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a comparison between item stats and the player's
    current equipped items. It may also consider item level requirements, class restrictions,
    and slot compatibility when making its determination.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player object passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes.
