  class: Unit
  method: GetMovementAnimKitId
  signature: uint16 Unit::GetMovementAnimKitId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement animation kit ID associated with the unit.
  description: The GetMovementAnimKitId method retrieves the animation kit identifier
    that controls how a unit moves, including walking, running, or other locomotion
    animations. This value is used internally by the game engine to determine which
    animation sequences should be applied when a unit performs movement actions. The
    method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related APIs to manage
    unit behavior during gameplay. It does not require any parameters and returns
    a uint16 value representing the animation kit ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the movement animation kit ID. This
    ID corresponds to an animation kit defined in the game's animation database, which
    governs how the unit's movement animations are handled during gameplay.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 animKitId = unit->GetMovementAnimKitId();\nif (animKitId != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Process animation kit\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class's movement-related functionality and
    should be used carefully in conjunction with other movement APIs. Performance
    considerations may arise when frequently accessing this value during movement
    updates, especially in high-frequency scenarios such as combat or movement-based
    AI.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method in contexts where animation
    kit IDs are expected to be valid; invalid or zero values may indicate missing
    or incorrect data, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in unit movement.
