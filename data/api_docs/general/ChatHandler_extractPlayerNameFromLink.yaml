  method: extractPlayerNameFromLink
  signature: int ChatHandler::extractPlayerNameFromLink(char * text)
documentation:
  brief: Extracts a player name from a chat link string and returns the index of the
    extracted name.
  description: The extractPlayerNameFromLink method parses a chat link string (typically
    in the format |Hplayer:name|h[name]|h) to extract the player's name. It searches
    through the provided text for a valid player link pattern, extracts the embedded
    player name, and returns the position where the extraction ended. This method
    is commonly used in TrinityCore's ChatHandler class when processing chat commands
    or messages that contain player references. The method modifies the input string
    during parsing but does not alter its overall structure beyond extracting the
    name. It assumes the text parameter points to a null-terminated character array
    containing a valid chat link.
  parameters:
  - name: text
    description: A pointer to a null-terminated character array containing a chat
      link string with embedded player information. The string should be in the format
      |Hplayer:name|h[name]|h where 'name' represents the player's name to be extracted.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the index position within the input text
    after the extracted player name. If no valid player link is found, it returns
    -1. The return value indicates how many characters were processed from the beginning
    of the string up to and including the end of the extracted player name.
  examples:
  - title: Extracting a Player Name from a Chat Link
    code: 'char text[] = "|Hplayer:JohnDoe|h[JohnDoe]|h";

      int result = handler.extractPlayerNameFromLink(text);

      // Result will be 20, indicating that the player name ''JohnDoe'' was extracted

      // and the parsing ended at index 20 in the string.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Invalid Chat Link
    code: 'char text[] = "This is not a valid link";

      int result = handler.extractPlayerNameFromLink(text);

      // Result will be -1, indicating no player name was found in the string.'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method modifies the input character array during parsing by temporarily
    null-terminating parts of it. This behavior is typical for TrinityCore's chat
    link parsing functions. The method relies on standard string manipulation and
    pattern matching techniques to identify valid player links. It is designed to
    work with the specific format used internally by World of Warcraft's chat system.
  warnings: The input text parameter must point to a valid, null-terminated character
    array. If the text is NULL or not properly null-terminated, the method may cause
    undefined behavior or crashes. The method modifies the input string during processing,
    so if you need to preserve the original content, make sure to create a copy before
    calling this function.
