documentation:
  brief: Loads localized page text data for all languages from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadPageTextLocales method retrieves localized page text entries
    from the database and stores them in memory for use by the game client. This method
    is typically called during server startup or database reload operations to ensure
    that all language-specific versions of page texts (such as quest items, books,
    or NPC dialog) are available. It processes locale-specific data for pages, including
    text content and associated metadata, making it accessible for localization purposes.
    The method does not return any value but modifies internal data structures within
    the ObjectMgr class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void InitializeWorld()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    sObjectMgr->LoadPageTextLocales();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's database loading sequence and should
    only be called after the database connection has been established. It assumes
    that the 'page_text_locale' table exists in the database with appropriate columns
    for locale-specific page text data.
