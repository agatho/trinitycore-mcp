documentation:
  brief: Moves an item from one slot to another within the guild bank.
  description: The ExecuteItemMove method handles the movement of an item between
    two slots in a guild's bank tab. It updates the guild bank inventory by removing
    the item from the source slot and placing it into the destination slot. This method
    is typically invoked when a guild member attempts to reorganize their guild bank
    items. The operation involves validating the move request, checking for valid
    tab and slot indices, and ensuring that the target slot is either empty or compatible
    with the item being moved. This function does not perform any permission checks;
    it assumes that the calling code has already verified that the player has appropriate
    access rights to modify the guild bank.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who is performing the move operation. Used for logging and permission
      verification.
  - name: fromTab
    description: Index of the source tab in the guild bank from which the item will
      be moved. Must be a valid tab index within the guild's bank tabs range.
  - name: fromSlot
    description: Index of the source slot within the specified tab from which the
      item will be moved. Must be a valid slot index within the tab's bounds.
  - name: toTab
    description: Index of the destination tab in the guild bank where the item will
      be moved. Must be a valid tab index within the guild's bank tabs range.
  - name: toSlot
    description: Index of the destination slot within the specified tab where the
      item will be placed. Must be a valid slot index within the tab's bounds.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Move Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager* bankMgr = sGuildBankMgr;

      bankMgr->ExecuteItemMove(&playerId, 0, 5, 1, 3); // Move item from tab 0 slot
      5 to tab 1 slot 3'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal guild bank management system and should
    not be called directly by external modules without proper validation. The method
    assumes that all parameters are valid and does not perform bounds checking on
    tab or slot indices beyond basic parameter passing.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid tab or slot indices may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player has appropriate permissions before
    invoking this function, as it does not perform any permission checks internally.
