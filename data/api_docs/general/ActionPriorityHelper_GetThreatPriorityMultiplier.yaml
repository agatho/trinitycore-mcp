  class: ActionPriorityHelper
  method: GetThreatPriorityMultiplier
  signature: float ActionPriorityHelper::GetThreatPriorityMultiplier(int * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the threat priority multiplier for a given unit.
  description: The GetThreatPriorityMultiplier method computes a floating-point value
    that represents how much threat a unit contributes to the AI's decision-making
    process. This multiplier is used internally by the ActionPriorityHelper class
    to determine the relative importance of targeting or prioritizing specific units
    during combat. The method takes an integer pointer to a unit identifier and evaluates
    its threat level based on factors such as current threat, health, and proximity
    to the player or target. It returns a float value that can be used to adjust action
    priorities in AI decision trees.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unit identifier (GUID) for
      which the threat priority multiplier is calculated. The value pointed to should
      be a valid unit GUID, typically obtained from game objects or creature instances.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated threat priority multiplier. Values
    are typically greater than or equal to zero, with higher values indicating higher
    threat contribution. A return value of 0.0f usually indicates no threat or an
    invalid unit reference.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int unitGuid = 12345;\nfloat multiplier = helper.GetThreatPriorityMultiplier(&unitGuid);\n\
      if (multiplier > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Process threat-based action priority\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI decision logic
    code: "int targetUnit = ai->GetTarget();\nfloat threatMultiplier = helper.GetThreatPriorityMultiplier(&targetUnit);\n\
      if (threatMultiplier > 1.0f)\n{\n    // Prioritize actions targeting this high-threat\
      \ unit\n    ai->SetCurrentActionPriority(threatMultiplier);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI system and should only be called from
    within valid AI contexts. The multiplier value may vary depending on game state,
    such as combat phase or player actions. Ensure that the unit pointer passed to
    this method points to a valid, active unit in the current world context.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null unit pointer can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate the unit identifier before calling this method. The
    returned multiplier is not guaranteed to be stable across multiple calls and should
    not be cached for extended periods.
