  class: FeralDruid
  method: FeralDruid
  signature: void FeralDruid::FeralDruid(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a FeralDruid AI class instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The FeralDruid constructor initializes the AI behavior for a feral
    druid player character in the TrinityCore environment. This method sets up the
    necessary internal state and configuration for the druid to perform AI-driven
    actions such as spell casting, movement, and combat decisions. The initialization
    process typically involves setting up ability priorities, threat management, and
    resource tracking specific to feral druid gameplay mechanics. The method expects
    a valid Player object representing the bot character that will be controlled by
    this AI implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the feral druid bot character
      that this AI instance will control. Must not be null and must represent a valid
      druid class character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic FeralDruid Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      FeralDruid druidAI(myBot);

      // AI is now initialized and ready to control the bot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing FeralDruid with Error Checking
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nif (bot && bot->getClass() == CLASS_DRUID)\n{\n   \
      \ FeralDruid druidAI(bot);\n    // Bot is now controlled by feral druid AI\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid player or class\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called with valid Player objects that represent
    druid characters. The AI implementation assumes the bot has proper druid abilities
    and spell configurations loaded. This method does not perform any combat or movement
    logic directly; it merely initializes the AI state for later use.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this constructor will likely cause a crash or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object is valid and represents a druid
    character before calling this constructor. The AI system may not function correctly
    if initialized with non-druid characters.
