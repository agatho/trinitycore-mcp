documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the configuration settings for DPS positioning behavior
  description: The GetConfig method returns a constant reference to the internal DPSPositionConfig
    object that holds all configuration parameters for the DPS positioning system.
    This configuration includes settings such as positioning thresholds, target selection
    criteria, and movement behaviors that govern how a DPS character should position
    themselves during combat. The returned reference provides access to read-only
    configuration values without allowing modification through this interface. This
    method is typically called during initialization or when evaluating positioning
    strategies during active combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the DPSPositionConfig object containing all current
    configuration settings for DPS positioning behavior
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Configuration Values
    code: 'const DPSPositionConfig& config = dpsPositioning->GetConfig();

      float threshold = config.GetPositioningThreshold();

      bool useSmartTargeting = config.UseSmartTargeting();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Configuration Before Combat
    code: "if (dpsPositioning->GetConfig().GetMaxDistance() > 10.0f)\n{\n    // Adjust\
      \ positioning strategy for long-range encounters\n    dpsPositioning->SetCombatStrategy(DPS_STRATEGY_RANGED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference is valid only as long as the DPSPositioning object
    exists. This method performs no computation or data processing; it simply returns
    a cached configuration reference. The configuration object should not be modified
    through this interface as it's designed to be read-only.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the configuration through the returned reference,
    as it is const. Modifications should only be made through dedicated setter methods
    or configuration loading mechanisms. Accessing the configuration after the DPSPositioning
    object has been destroyed results in undefined behavior.
