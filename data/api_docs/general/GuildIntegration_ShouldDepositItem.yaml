  class: GuildIntegration
  method: ShouldDepositItem
  signature: bool GuildIntegration::ShouldDepositItem(int * player, uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player's item should be deposited into the guild bank.
  description: The ShouldDepositItem method evaluates if a specific item, identified
    by its item ID, should be automatically deposited into the guild bank when a player
    interacts with a guild banker or performs a deposit action. This method typically
    checks various conditions such as item type, quality, stack size, and guild configuration
    settings to determine eligibility for automatic deposit. It is commonly used in
    conjunction with guild banking mechanics and may be invoked during item transaction
    processing within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that is attempting to deposit the item.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being evaluated for deposit into
      the guild bank.
  returns: Returns true if the item should be deposited into the guild bank, false
    otherwise. The decision is based on internal logic evaluating item properties
    and guild settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 itemId = 12345;\nbool shouldDeposit = GuildIntegration::ShouldDepositItem(&player,\
      \ itemId);\nif (shouldDeposit)\n{\n    // Proceed with guild bank deposit logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Guild Bank Deposit
    code: "void HandleGuildBankDeposit(Player* player, uint32 itemId)\n{\n    if (GuildIntegration::ShouldDepositItem(&player,\
      \ itemId))\n    {\n        // Perform automatic guild bank deposit\n       \
      \ player->GetSession()->SendGuildBankDepositResult(GUILD_BANK_DEPOSIT_SUCCESS);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle manual deposit or deny\n        player->GetSession()->SendGuildBankDepositResult(GUILD_BANK_DEPOSIT_FAILED);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with configuration settings stored in the database
    or in-memory guild data structures. It may be called frequently during item transactions,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account for large guilds.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. The method assumes proper initialization of
    the guild integration system and may return unexpected results if invoked outside
    of a valid game context.
