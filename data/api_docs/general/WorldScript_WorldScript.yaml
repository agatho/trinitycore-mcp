  class: WorldScript
  method: WorldScript
  signature: void WorldScript::WorldScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a WorldScript instance with the specified name for global world
    event handling.
  description: The WorldScript constructor initializes a world script instance with
    a given name, which is used to register and manage global world events within
    the TrinityCore server. This constructor is typically called during server startup
    or when loading scripts dynamically. The name parameter serves as an identifier
    for the script, allowing the server to distinguish between different world scripts.
    It's important to note that this is not a standalone method but rather a constructor
    used in the context of scripting systems. World scripts are responsible for handling
    global events such as holiday celebrations, server-wide announcements, or time-based
    triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that uniquely identifies this world script
      instance. This name is used internally by the TrinityCore scripting system to
      manage and reference the script during event processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic WorldScript Initialization
    code: "class MyWorldScript : public WorldScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyWorldScript()\
      \ : WorldScript(\"MyCustomWorldScript\")\n    {\n        // Constructor body\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the WorldScript base class and should be called
    as part of a derived class constructor. The name parameter must be unique to avoid
    conflicts in the script registry. This is typically used in custom expansion or
    modification code where developers want to hook into global world events.
