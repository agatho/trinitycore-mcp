documentation:
  brief: Saves all player reputation data to the database
  description: The SaveReputations method persists all current reputation values for
    a player's social list into the database. This method is typically invoked during
    player logout or at regular intervals to ensure that reputation changes are not
    lost. It handles the serialization and storage of faction standings, including
    both base and temporary reputation adjustments. The method operates on the player's
    social manager instance and updates the corresponding database records for the
    active character.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Logout
    code: "void Player::SaveReputations()\n{\n    if (socialManager)\n        socialManager->SaveReputations();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically by the core during player session
    cleanup. Developers should not typically call this directly unless implementing
    custom save logic. The operation is synchronous and may cause minor performance
    overhead depending on the number of factions tracked.
