documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is immune to all damage and effects.
  description: This method determines whether a player has total immunity, meaning
    they are completely protected from all forms of damage and harmful effects. It
    typically returns true when the player is in a state where they cannot take any
    damage, such as during certain PvP or PvE encounters, or when specific game mechanics
    are active that grant immunity. The method is often used in conjunction with other
    immunity-related functions to determine the player's defensive status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has total immunity, false otherwise. This indicates
    that the player cannot receive any damage or be affected by harmful effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->isTotalImmune())\n{\n    // Player is immune to all damage\n\
      \    // Do not process damage calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be used in conjunction with other immunity checks such as
    'IsImmuneToDamage' or 'IsImmuneToEffect'. Implementation details include checking
    for active buffs, debuffs, or game states that might grant total immunity.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other immunity checks; it specifically
    checks for complete immunity rather than partial immunity. Using this method inappropriately
    can lead to incorrect gameplay behavior.
