documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell ID that is granted when a quest is completed.
  description: The GetRewSpell method retrieves the spell ID that is awarded to the
    player upon completing a quest. This spell typically represents the reward for
    completing the quest, such as a buff or ability that the player gains after finishing
    the quest objectives. The method is commonly used in quest scripts and reward
    systems to determine what spell should be applied to the player when they finish
    the quest. It's important to note that this value may be zero if no spell reward
    is defined for the specific quest, indicating that the quest has no spell-based
    reward.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the spell ID (uint32) that is granted upon quest completion. A
    value of 0 indicates that no spell reward is defined for this quest, meaning the
    quest does not provide any spell-based reward to the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Quest* quest = player->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nuint32 spellId = quest->GetRewSpell();\n\
      if (spellId != 0)\n{\n    // Apply the spell reward\n    player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ spellId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods to properly handle quest rewards. The returned
    spell ID may be zero if no reward exists for the quest, which is common in many
    quests that only provide gold or experience rewards.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return 0 for quests without
    spell rewards. Always check if the returned value is non-zero before applying
    any spell effects to avoid potential errors.
