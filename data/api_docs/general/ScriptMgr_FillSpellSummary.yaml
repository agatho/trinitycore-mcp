  method: FillSpellSummary
  signature: void ScriptMgr::FillSpellSummary()
documentation:
  brief: Populates the spell summary data structure with information about all registered
    spells in the script manager.
  description: The FillSpellSummary method is responsible for gathering and organizing
    spell-related data from all loaded scripts within the TrinityCore framework. It
    iterates through the registered spell scripts and compiles a comprehensive summary
    of their properties, effects, and behaviors. This method is typically invoked
    during server initialization or when spell data needs to be refreshed in memory.
    The compiled spell summary is used internally by the core for spell validation,
    lookup operations, and various game mechanics that depend on scripted spell behavior.
    The method ensures that all custom spell implementations are properly integrated
    into the global spell database.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeSpellSystem()\n{\n    sScriptMgr->FillSpellSummary();\n\
      \    // Spell summary is now populated with all registered spells\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after all scripts have been loaded but
    before the server begins processing game events. It's a critical part of the initialization
    sequence and modifies global spell data structures that are accessed by multiple
    subsystems throughout the core.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during runtime may result in duplicate
    entries or inconsistent spell data. It should only be invoked once during server
    startup or when explicitly reloading spell scripts.
