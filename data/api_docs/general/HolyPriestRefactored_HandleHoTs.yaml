documentation:
  brief: Applies or updates HoTs (Heal over Time) effects to group members within
    the Holy Priest's range
  description: The HandleHoTs method manages the application and updating of Heal
    over Time effects for the Holy Priest class. This method is responsible for identifying
    eligible group members within the priest's casting range, applying appropriate
    HoT spells such as Renew or Flash Heal, and ensuring proper stacking and duration
    management. It handles both single-target and area-of-effect healing scenarios,
    maintaining optimal healing distribution across the group while respecting spell
    cooldowns and resource constraints. The method integrates with TrinityCore's combat
    system to ensure that HoT effects are properly tracked and updated during combat
    encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one HoT effect was successfully applied or updated,
    false if no valid targets were found or if the operation failed due to resource
    constraints or invalid state
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in priest AI
    code: "void HolyPriestAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        if (HandleHoTs(0)) // Apply HoTs to group\n        {\n     \
      \       // Successfully applied healing effects\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the priest has sufficient mana and that the target group
    members are within appropriate range. The method may be called multiple times
    per update cycle to ensure continuous HoT application. Implementation uses TrinityCore's
    Group and Aura systems for tracking targets and effect durations.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context without proper validation,
    as it may cause unexpected behavior with target selection. Ensure that the priest
    has valid group members before calling to avoid unnecessary processing.
