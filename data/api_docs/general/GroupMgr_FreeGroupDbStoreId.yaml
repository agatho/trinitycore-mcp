  method: FreeGroupDbStoreId
  signature: void GroupMgr::FreeGroupDbStoreId(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Frees the database store ID associated with a group in the GroupMgr system.
  description: The FreeGroupDbStoreId method releases the database identifier (DB
    ID) that was previously assigned to a group object within the GroupMgr subsystem.
    This typically occurs when a group is disbanded or removed from the active group
    management system, ensuring that the DB ID can be reused for future group creations.
    The method ensures proper cleanup of internal tracking structures related to group
    persistence in the database. It is an internal utility method used by the group
    management logic to maintain consistency between in-memory group objects and their
    corresponding database entries.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Freeing a group's DB ID after disbanding
    code: "Group* group = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (group)\n{\n    sGroupMgr->FreeGroupDbStoreId(group);\n\
      \    // Group DB ID is now freed and available for reuse\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on groups that are no longer active or
    have been fully processed for removal. It assumes the group pointer is valid and
    has an assigned database store ID. The method does not perform any validation
    checks on the group object itself.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group without a valid DB ID assignment may lead
    to undefined behavior or corruption of internal data structures. Ensure that the
    group is properly removed from all systems before calling this method.
