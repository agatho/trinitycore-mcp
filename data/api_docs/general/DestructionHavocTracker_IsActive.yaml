  class: DestructionHavocTracker
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool DestructionHavocTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the destruction havoc tracker is currently active.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the DestructionHavocTracker instance
    is currently active within the game context. This tracker likely monitors or manages
    the state of destruction havoc abilities or effects for a specific player or unit.
    The method returns true when the tracker is actively tracking or managing havoc-related
    mechanics, and false otherwise. This functionality is typically used in spell
    or ability systems to determine if certain destructive effects are currently in
    effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the destruction havoc tracker is currently active and managing
    havoc-related effects; returns false if it is inactive or not tracking any havoc
    mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetDestructionHavocTracker()->IsActive()) {\n    // Apply havoc\
      \ effect logic\n    player->ApplyHavocEffect();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Activation
    code: "if (!target->GetDestructionHavocTracker()->IsActive()) {\n    // Trigger\
      \ havoc ability only if not already active\n    target->TriggerHavocAbility();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where havoc is already active\n    target->RefreshHavocDuration();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a simple state check on an internal flag or counter.
    It's designed to be lightweight and fast, as it may be called frequently during
    gameplay updates. The active state might be managed by other methods in the class
    such as Start(), Stop(), or Reset().
  warnings: Ensure that the DestructionHavocTracker instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as calling IsActive() on a null pointer will result
    in undefined behavior. This method does not modify the tracker's state, so it
    can be safely called multiple times without side effects.
