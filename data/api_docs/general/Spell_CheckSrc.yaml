  brief: Checks and validates the source of a spell's target
  description: The CheckSrc method in TrinityCore's Spell class verifies that the
    spell's source location is valid and properly configured. This method ensures
    that the spell's target coordinates or object references are correctly set up
    before execution, preventing potential issues such as invalid target positions
    or missing target objects. It typically performs validation checks on the spell's
    source parameters to ensure they meet game mechanics requirements for proper targeting.

  - title: Basic Spell Source Check Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->CheckSrc();

      // This ensures the spell''s source location is valid'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell initialization or before execution
    to validate source parameters. It may involve checking target coordinates, object
    references, or other source-related elements depending on the specific spell type.
  warnings: Improper source validation can lead to incorrect targeting behavior and
    potential game crashes if not handled properly. This method should be called before
    any spell execution to ensure proper validation.
