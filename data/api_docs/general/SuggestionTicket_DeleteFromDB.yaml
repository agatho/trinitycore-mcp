documentation:
  brief: Deletes the suggestion ticket from the database.
  description: The DeleteFromDB method removes the current SuggestionTicket instance
    from the database storage. This method is typically called when a player's suggestion
    has been processed, dismissed, or is no longer relevant. The operation directly
    affects the underlying database record associated with this ticket, ensuring that
    it will no longer appear in active suggestion lists or be accessible through standard
    ticket retrieval mechanisms. Before calling this method, it is assumed that appropriate
    validation or processing has occurred to ensure the deletion is intentional and
    valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Deleting a processed suggestion ticket
    code: "SuggestionTicket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetSuggestionTicket(12345);\nif\
      \ (ticket)\n{\n    // Process the ticket logic here\n    ticket->DeleteFromDB();\n\
      \    sTicketMgr->RemoveSuggestionTicket(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct database DELETE operation and should only be
    called after verifying that the ticket is no longer needed. It does not perform
    any cleanup of in-memory references, so callers must ensure proper removal from
    any collections or managers holding references to the ticket.
  warnings: Calling DeleteFromDB on a ticket that has already been deleted may result
    in undefined behavior or database errors. Always verify the ticket's existence
    and state before deletion.
