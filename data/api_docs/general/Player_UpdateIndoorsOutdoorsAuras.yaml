    of auras that are dependent on whether the player is indoors or outdoors. This
    method is typically called when a player's environment changes, such as entering
    or leaving a building, dungeon, or outdoor area. It ensures that appropriate auras
    are applied or removed to reflect the player's current location state. The method

    which can affect various gameplay mechanics including visibility, combat effects,
