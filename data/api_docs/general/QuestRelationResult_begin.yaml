  method: begin
  signature: Iterator QuestRelationResult::begin() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the quest relation collection.
  description: The begin() method provides access to the beginning of a QuestRelationResult
    container, which typically holds references to quests associated with a specific
    NPC or player. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework when iterating over quest relations during quest handling, dialogue
    processing, or quest state management. The returned iterator allows developers
    to traverse the collection of quest relations in a standard C++ style. It is important
    to note that this method returns a const iterator, meaning the elements cannot
    be modified through this interface. This method does not perform any validation
    or checks on the underlying data structure and assumes the container is properly
    initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: An iterator pointing to the first element in the QuestRelationResult collection.
    The iterator type is typically a const forward iterator that allows traversal
    of quest relations without modification.
  examples:
  - title: Basic iteration over quest relations
    code: "QuestRelationResult result = player->GetQuestRelations();\nfor (auto it\
      \ = result.begin(); it != result.end(); ++it)\n{\n    Quest const* quest = *it;\n\
      \    // Process each quest relation\n    sLog->outString(\"Processing quest:\
      \ %u\", quest->GetQuestId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using range-based for loop with begin() and end()
    code: "QuestRelationResult result = npc->GetQuestRelations();\nfor (auto const&\
      \ quest : result)\n{\n    if (quest && quest->IsActive())\n    {\n        //\
      \ Handle active quests\n        sLog->outString(\"Active quest found: %u\",\
      \ quest->GetQuestId());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The QuestRelationResult container is typically implemented as a collection
    of pointers to Quest objects. This method provides a standard interface for iterating
    over quest relations, which is essential for quest system functionality in TrinityCore.
    The returned iterator should be used with proper bounds checking when traversing
    the collection to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: When using the returned iterator, ensure that the underlying QuestRelationResult
    container remains valid throughout the iteration process. Modifying the container
    while iterating through begin() and end() may invalidate iterators or cause undefined
    behavior. Also note that this is a const method, so any attempt to modify quest
    relations through the returned iterator will result in compilation errors.
