  class: ObjectCache
  method: SetFollowTarget
  signature: void ObjectCache::SetFollowTarget(::Unit * followTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target unit for an object to follow in the game world.
  description: The SetFollowTarget method assigns a specific Unit as the target for
    an Object to follow. This functionality is commonly used in AI systems where creatures
    or NPCs need to track and move toward a designated target. The method updates
    internal state variables to maintain the follow relationship, ensuring that the
    object's movement behavior aligns with the specified target. It does not perform
    any immediate movement actions but rather establishes the target for subsequent
    follow logic to process.
  parameters:
  - name: followTarget
    description: A pointer to the Unit object that will serve as the target for following.
      This parameter must be a valid Unit instance, typically representing a player
      or another NPC. If null is passed, the follow behavior is typically disabled
      or reset.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Unit* target = player;

      objectCache->SetFollowTarget(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Follow Target to Player
    code: "if (player && objectCache)\n{\n    objectCache->SetFollowTarget(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement AI logic. The
    actual following behavior may depend on additional factors such as distance thresholds,
    movement speed, and pathfinding algorithms implemented within the ObjectCache's
    AI system.
  warnings: Ensure that the followTarget parameter points to a valid Unit object before
    calling this method. Passing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes if not properly handled by the underlying implementation.
