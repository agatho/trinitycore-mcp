  class: Unit
  method: SetExtraUnitMovementFlags
  signature: void Unit::SetExtraUnitMovementFlags(uint32 f)
documentation:
  brief: Sets extra movement flags for a unit, enabling additional movement behaviors
    and states.
  description: This method allows developers to set additional movement flags on a
    Unit object, which can modify how the unit moves, behaves, or interacts with the
    game world. It is commonly used to enable specific movement types like flying,
    swimming, or other special states that require extra flag settings. The method
    directly affects the unit's movement behavior and can be used in conjunction with
    other movement-related methods to control complex movement scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: f
    description: The uint32 value representing the movement flags to set. This parameter
      typically contains a combination of flag values that define specific movement
      behaviors or states, such as flying, swimming, or other special movement types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting movement flags for flying
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetPlayer();

      unit->SetExtraUnitMovementFlags(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting multiple movement flags
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetCreature();

      unit->SetExtraUnitMovementFlags(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING | MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal movement flags of a Unit object.
    It should be used carefully as it affects how the unit moves and interacts with
    the game world. Performance considerations are minimal, but excessive flag setting
    may impact movement calculations. Thread safety depends on the context in which
    this method is called.
  warnings: Improper use of movement flags can cause unexpected behavior or movement
    issues. Care should be taken when setting flags that conflict with existing movement
    states. Setting incorrect flags may result in unit movement anomalies or game
    mechanics errors.
