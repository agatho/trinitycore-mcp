documentation:
  brief: Processes a player's vote to boot another player from a Looking for Group
    (LFG) dungeon.
  description: The HandleLfgSetBootVoteOpcode method handles the client-side packet
    sent when a player votes to boot another player from a LFG dungeon. This method
    is part of the Dungeon Finder system in World of Warcraft, where players can vote
    to remove a disruptive member from their group. The method receives a DFBootPlayerVote
    packet containing the vote details and processes it according to LFG voting rules.
    It typically checks if the vote is valid, updates the internal boot vote tracking,
    and may trigger a vote result or kick action if enough votes are collected.
  parameters:
  - name: dfBootPlayerVote
    description: A packet containing the player's vote to boot another player. This
      includes the target player's GUID and the vote decision (yes/no).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vote Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleLfgSetBootVoteOpcode(WorldPackets::LFG::DFBootPlayerVote&\
      \ dfBootPlayerVote)\n{\n    // Process the boot vote\n    sLFGMgr->ProcessBootVote(this,\
      \ dfBootPlayerVote.PlayerGuid, dfBootPlayerVote.Vote);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main packet handling loop when a
    DFBootPlayerVote packet is received. The actual vote processing logic is delegated
    to LFG manager subsystem which handles vote counting and group state updates.
  warnings: Improper handling of boot votes can lead to players being incorrectly
    removed from groups or vote manipulation. Ensure proper validation of player permissions
    and group membership before processing votes.
