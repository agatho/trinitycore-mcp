documentation:
  brief: Manages resource efficiency for the Monk AI, optimizing energy usage during
    combat.
  description: The ManageResourceEfficiency method is responsible for controlling
    how a Monk AI character utilizes its energy resources during combat engagements.
    This includes determining when to use abilities that consume energy, such as Tiger
    Palm or Blackout Kick, based on current energy levels and tactical circumstances.
    The method evaluates the AI's energy state, compares it against thresholds for
    optimal ability usage, and ensures efficient resource allocation to maximize damage
    output or survivability depending on the configured playstyle. It is typically
    called during the AI's update cycle to make real-time decisions about energy management
    without requiring external input.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    ManageResourceEfficiency();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has access to accurate energy level information
    and that combat state is properly maintained. It does not directly interact with
    the player's energy bar but rather makes decisions based on internal AI state
    tracking.
