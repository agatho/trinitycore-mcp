  class: Trigger
  method: GetPriority
  signature: uint32 Trigger::GetPriority() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the execution priority value of the trigger.
  description: The GetPriority method returns the numerical priority level assigned
    to a Trigger object. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and event system, triggers
    are used to define conditions that activate certain behaviors or actions. The
    priority value determines the order in which triggers are evaluated when multiple
    conditions are met simultaneously. A higher numeric value typically indicates
    a higher priority, meaning the trigger will be processed before others with lower
    values. This method is essential for managing the execution flow and ensuring
    proper event handling within game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the trigger's priority level. Higher values
    indicate higher priority, though the exact interpretation may depend on the system
    implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Trigger* trigger = ...;

      uint32 priority = trigger->GetPriority();

      printf("Trigger priority: %u\n", priority);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sorting Triggers by Priority
    code: "std::vector<Trigger*> triggers = GetActiveTriggers();\nstd::sort(triggers.begin(),\
      \ triggers.end(), [](Trigger* a, Trigger* b) {\n    return a->GetPriority()\
      \ > b->GetPriority(); // Higher priority first\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: The priority value is typically set during trigger initialization or configuration.
    It's important to note that the specific behavior of how priorities are used may
    vary depending on the subsystem (e.g., AI, event handling, etc.) where the trigger
    is employed.
