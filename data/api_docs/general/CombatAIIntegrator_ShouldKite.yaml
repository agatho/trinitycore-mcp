  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: ShouldKite
  signature: bool CombatAIIntegrator::ShouldKite()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI-controlled unit should perform a kiting movement
    during combat.
  description: The ShouldKite method evaluates various combat conditions and AI state
    to decide if the current unit should engage in kiting behavior, which typically
    involves maintaining distance from the target while dealing damage. This method
    is crucial for AI-driven units that need to balance offensive capabilities with
    survival mechanics. It considers factors such as health percentage, distance to
    target, available abilities, and threat level to make this decision. The result
    directly influences whether the unit will attempt to reposition itself during
    combat rather than standing still or charging forward.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI unit should initiate or continue a kiting behavior;
    returns false if the unit should not kite, typically indicating that it's safe
    to engage more aggressively or maintain current positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat decision making
    code: "if (unit->GetAI()->ShouldKite()) {\n    unit->GetAI()->DoKite();\n} else\
      \ {\n    unit->GetAI()->DoMeleeAttack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom AI logic
    code: "class MyCombatAI : public CombatAIIntegrator {\npublic:\n    bool UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (ShouldKite()) {\n            // Perform kiting\
      \ behavior\n            MoveOutOfMeleeRange();\n        } else {\n         \
      \   // Normal combat behavior\n            AttackTarget();\n        }\n    \
      \    return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and may be influenced
    by the unit's current health, target distance, and available spell/ability cooldowns.
    The kiting decision-making process considers both immediate combat state and long-term
    tactical positioning.
  warnings: Improper implementation of kiting logic can lead to units becoming stuck
    in place or moving erratically. Ensure that the method is only called when valid
    combat conditions exist to avoid unnecessary processing.
