  brief: Clears the player's whisper whitelist, allowing all players to send whispers
  description: This method removes all entries from the player's whisper whitelist,
    effectively disabling the whitelist functionality. When a player's whisper whitelist
    is cleared, any previously added players will no longer be restricted from sending
    whispers to that player. This method is typically used during gameplay when a
    player wants to disable their whitelist for communication purposes or when resetting
    their communication settings. The operation affects the player's ability to receive
    whispers from specific players and is part of the broader communication system
    in TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetSession()->GetPlayer();

      player->ClearWhisperWhiteList();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during gameplay when a player wants to reset
    their communication settings or when they want to allow all players to send whispers
    without restriction. It's important to note that this operation does not affect
    other player communication settings like the ignore list.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may affect player communication
    behavior, especially in PvP environments where players might be restricted from
    sending whispers to specific targets.
