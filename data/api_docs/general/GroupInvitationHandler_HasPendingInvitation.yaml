  signature: bool GroupInvitationHandler::HasPendingInvitation() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has a pending group invitation.
  description: The HasPendingInvitation method determines if a player currently has
    an active group invitation that has not yet been accepted or declined. This method
    is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's grouping system, where
    players can be invited to join groups (parties or raids) by other players. The
    method returns true if there is a pending invitation, and false otherwise. It
    is commonly called before attempting to perform group-related actions to ensure
    that no conflicting invitations exist.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has a pending group invitation; otherwise, returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Pending Invitation
    code: "if (player->GetGroupInvitationHandler()->HasPendingInvitation()) {\n  \
      \  // Player has a pending group invitation\n    sLog->outString(\"Player has\
      \ a pending group invitation.\");\n} else {\n    // No pending invitation\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"No pending group invitation.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GroupInvitationHandler class and is typically
    used in conjunction with other group invitation handling methods such as AcceptInvitation,
    DeclineInvitation, or CancelInvitation. The implementation likely relies on internal
    state tracking within the player's session to determine if an invitation exists.
