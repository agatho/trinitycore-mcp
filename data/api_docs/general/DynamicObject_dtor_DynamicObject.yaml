  signature: void DynamicObject::~DynamicObject()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DynamicObject instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~DynamicObject destructor is automatically invoked when a DynamicObject
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of the dynamic object, including releasing memory allocated for its data
    members and removing it from relevant game systems such as the world object manager.
    It is part of the standard C++ object lifecycle management and should not be called
    directly by developers unless performing explicit object destruction. The destructor
    handles cleanup of temporary effects, visual components, and any internal references
    that may have been created during the object's lifetime.

  - title: Automatic Destruction of DynamicObject
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    DynamicObject* dynObj = new DynamicObject();\n\
      \    // ... use dynObj ...\n    delete dynObj; // Destructor called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The destruction process ensures that all associated
    game entities are properly removed from the world state and any visual effects
    are cleaned up.
