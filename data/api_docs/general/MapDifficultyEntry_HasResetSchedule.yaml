  class: MapDifficultyEntry
  method: HasResetSchedule
  signature: bool MapDifficultyEntry::HasResetSchedule() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map difficulty entry has a reset schedule configured.
  description: The HasResetSchedule method checks if the current MapDifficultyEntry
    instance is associated with a reset schedule. This typically indicates whether
    the map difficulty (such as a raid or dungeon) is designed to automatically reset
    at specific intervals or events. The method returns true if a reset schedule exists,
    and false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this is
    commonly used for managing instance resets in dungeons, raids, and other timed
    content.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map difficulty entry has a defined reset schedule;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a MapDifficultyEntry has a reset schedule
    code: "MapDifficultyEntry const* difficultyEntry = sMapDifficultyStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (difficultyEntry && difficultyEntry->HasResetSchedule()) {\n    // Handle\
      \ map with reset schedule\n    printf(\"This map has a reset schedule.\\n\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Handle map without reset schedule\n    printf(\"This map\
      \ does not have a reset schedule.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with instance management systems
    to determine when a player's access to a specific difficulty level should be reset,
    particularly for content that has time-based or event-driven resets.
