  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: HandleGroupMovementLogic
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::HandleGroupMovementLogic(PlayerbotGroup &
    group)
documentation:
  brief: Manages and executes group movement logic for player bots within a specified
    group.
  description: The HandleGroupMovementLogic method is responsible for coordinating
    the movement behavior of player bots that are part of a given group. It evaluates
    the current state of the group, including member positions, objectives, and movement
    priorities, to determine optimal collective actions such as formation maintenance,
    pathfinding, or tactical positioning. This method typically integrates with the
    bot AI system to ensure synchronized movement across multiple player-controlled
    entities. The implementation may consider factors like distance between members,
    terrain obstacles, and group strategy to maintain cohesion during gameplay activities
    such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a bot AI context
    code: "void MyBotAI::Update()\n{\n    if (PlayerbotGroup* group = GetGroup())\n\
      \    {\n        PlayerbotGroupManager::Instance()->HandleGroupMovementLogic(*group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the bot AI update cycle and should
    be called regularly to maintain group integrity. It relies on internal state tracking
    of player positions and group dynamics, so it's important that the group object
    passed is valid and up-to-date.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or stale PlayerbotGroup reference
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group pointer is always
    checked for validity before invoking this function.
