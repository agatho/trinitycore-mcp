  class: CreatureModel
  method: CreatureModel
  signature: void CreatureModel::CreatureModel(uint32 creatureDisplayID, float displayScale,
    float probability)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CreatureModel with specified display ID, scale, and probability
    values.
  description: The CreatureModel constructor initializes a creature model instance
    using the provided display ID, display scale, and probability. This method sets
    up the fundamental properties of a creature model within the TrinityCore framework,
    which is used for managing how creatures appear in the game world. The display
    ID corresponds to the visual representation of the creature, the display scale
    controls the size of the model, and the probability determines how often this
    specific model variant is selected when spawning creatures. This constructor is
    typically called during creature template initialization or when creating dynamic
    creature models based on random selection criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: creatureDisplayID
    description: The unique identifier for the creature's display model in the game
      database. This ID maps to a specific entry in the creature_display_info table
      and determines the visual appearance of the creature.
  - name: displayScale
    description: The scale factor applied to the creature's model dimensions. Values
      less than 1.0 shrink the model, values greater than 1.0 enlarge it, and a value
      of 1.0 maintains the original size. Typically ranges from 0.1 to 10.0.
  - name: probability
    description: The likelihood (as a percentage) that this specific model variant
      will be selected when spawning creatures. Values range from 0.0 (never selected)
      to 100.0 (always selected). Used for random model selection in creature templates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CreatureModel Initialization
    code: 'CreatureModel model(12345, 1.0f, 100.0f);

      // Creates a creature model with display ID 12345, normal scale, and 100% probability'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Smaller Variant Model
    code: 'CreatureModel smallModel(67890, 0.8f, 50.0f);

      // Creates a smaller version of a creature model with 50% probability of selection'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the CreatureModel class which is used internally
    by TrinityCore's creature spawning system. The probability value directly affects
    the random selection algorithm in creature template loading. Developers should
    ensure that the sum of probabilities for all models in a creature's model list
    equals 100.0 to maintain proper distribution behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect displayScale values may cause visual artifacts or clipping issues
    with the creature model. Setting probability values outside the 0.0-100.0 range
    can lead to undefined behavior in the random selection algorithm. Always validate
    that creatureDisplayID exists in the database before using it in this constructor.
