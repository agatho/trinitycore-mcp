  class: Creature
  method: SetRespawnDelay
  signature: void Creature::SetRespawnDelay(uint32 delay)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the respawn delay for a creature, determining how long the creature
    will remain dead before respawning.
  description: The SetRespawnDelay method configures the time interval in seconds
    that a creature will remain in its dead state before automatically respawning.
    This method is used to control the respawn behavior of creatures, particularly
    for bosses or elite mobs that should not respawn immediately after death. The
    delay parameter determines how long the creature stays dead before reappearing
    in the world. This functionality is essential for managing encounter difficulty
    and ensuring proper game progression in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: delay
    description: The respawn delay in seconds, specifying how long the creature remains
      dead before respawning. Valid values range from 0 to 3600 seconds (1 hour),
      with 0 indicating immediate respawn.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature;

      creature->SetRespawnDelay(300); // Sets respawn delay to 5 minutes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's respawn time directly, and should be used
    carefully when managing boss encounters. The actual respawn time may be influenced
    by other factors such as instance difficulty or specific game mechanics.
  warnings: Setting a very high delay value can cause performance issues if multiple
    creatures are affected. Also, setting delay to 0 will result in immediate respawn
    which may not be desired for boss fights.
