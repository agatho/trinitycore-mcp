documentation:
  brief: Removes creature data entry from the database and in-memory storage by spawn
    identifier
  description: The DeleteCreatureData method removes a creature spawn data entry from
    both the database and the in-memory object manager structures. This function is
    typically used when removing or despawning creatures that were dynamically spawned
    during gameplay. The method ensures consistency between the persistent database
    records and the runtime object cache. It performs necessary cleanup operations
    to prevent memory leaks and maintains the integrity of the creature spawn system.
    The operation affects only the specific spawn ID provided, leaving other creatures
    unaffected.
  parameters:
  - name: spawnId
    description: The unique identifier of the creature spawn data entry to be deleted.
      This corresponds to the SpawnId field in the creature table and is used to locate
      the specific creature instance for removal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic creature data deletion
    code: ObjectMgr::instance()->DeleteCreatureData(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional deletion with error handling
    code: "if (creatureSpawnId > 0)\n{\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->DeleteCreatureData(creatureSpawnId);\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup or logging can be performed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called with valid spawn IDs that exist in the
    database. The method performs automatic cleanup of related data structures and
    ensures thread safety through internal locking mechanisms. It's recommended to
    call this function before removing creature instances from the world to maintain
    consistency between database and memory states.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent spawnId may lead to
    undefined behavior or database inconsistencies. Ensure that all references to
    the deleted spawn are removed from active systems before calling this method.
    This operation is irreversible without manual database restoration.
