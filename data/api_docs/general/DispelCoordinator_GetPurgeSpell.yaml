documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell ID of the purge spell used by the DispelCoordinator.
  description: The GetPurgeSpell method retrieves the unique identifier (spell ID)
    associated with the purge spell that is managed by this DispelCoordinator instance.
    This spell is typically used in game mechanics to remove certain debuffs or effects
    from targets. The method serves as a getter for the internal purge spell data
    member, providing access to the spell information without modifying the coordinator's
    state. It is commonly invoked during dispel operations or when determining which
    spell should be applied for purging effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the spell ID of the purge spell. This identifier
    corresponds to a specific spell entry in the game's spell database, typically
    used to trigger or apply the purge effect during gameplay.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 purgeSpellId = dispelCoordinator.GetPurgeSpell();\nif (purgeSpellId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Use the spell ID to cast or apply the purge effect\n    SpellInfo\
      \ const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(purgeSpellId);\n    // ... perform\
      \ spell-related operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not perform any side effects or computations.
    It directly returns the stored spell ID value, making it safe to call multiple
    times without performance concerns.
