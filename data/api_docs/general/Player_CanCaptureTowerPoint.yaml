documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player can capture a tower point in World of Warcraft.
  description: The CanCaptureTowerPoint method checks if the player is eligible to
    capture a tower point, typically used in battleground scenarios such as Wintergrasp.
    This method evaluates various conditions including player level, faction status,
    and game state to determine eligibility. The function returns true when the player
    meets all requirements for capturing a tower point, otherwise false. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other methods that handle capture logic and control mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can capture a tower point, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player's current state allows them to participate in
    the capture process of a tower point in battlegrounds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->CanCaptureTowerPoint()) {\n    // Player can capture tower\
      \ point\n    // Proceed with capture logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Player cannot\
      \ capture tower point\n    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves checks for player level, faction status, and
    game state conditions. It may be related to the player's ability to participate
    in battlegrounds or specific objectives. Implementation details are not fully
    available but typically involves checking player state and conditions before allowing
    capture.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid battleground
    context. Calling it outside of proper game state may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. The method does not validate against all possible conditions
    that might prevent capture, so additional checks may be needed.
