  signature: int Battleground::GetInvitedCount(int team) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of players invited to the battleground for the specified
    team.
  description: The GetInvitedCount method retrieves the count of players who have
    been invited to join the battleground for a specific team. This method is typically
    used during battleground initialization and matchmaking processes to determine
    how many players are ready to participate. The method accepts a team parameter
    which specifies whether to query the Alliance (0) or Horde (1) team counts. It
    provides a snapshot of the current invitation status, which can be useful for
    balancing teams or determining when a battleground can begin. This count includes
    all players who have received an invitation but may not yet have accepted or joined
    the battleground.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier to query. Valid values are 0 for Alliance and
      1 for Horde.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of players invited to the specified
    team. A value of 0 indicates no players have been invited to that team.
  examples:
  - title: Get Invited Count for Alliance Team
    code: 'int allianceCount = bg->GetInvitedCount(0);

      // Returns the number of players invited to the Alliance team'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Both Teams' Invitation Status
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nint allianceCount\
      \ = bg->GetInvitedCount(0);\nint hordeCount = bg->GetInvitedCount(1);\nif (allianceCount\
      \ > 0 && hordeCount > 0)\n{\n    // Both teams have players invited\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a read-only count of invited players and does not modify
    any internal state. It's commonly used in battleground management systems to determine
    when sufficient players are available to start a match. The method is thread-safe
    as it only reads from existing data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the battleground instance is valid before calling this method,
    as calling it on a null or destroyed battleground may result in undefined behavior.
    Also note that invited count does not necessarily equal the number of players
    currently participating, as invitations can be accepted or rejected.
