  class: Group
  method: SetRestrictPingsTo
  signature: void Group::SetRestrictPingsTo(RestrictPingsTo restrictTo)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the ping restriction mode for the group.
  description: The SetRestrictPingsTo method configures whether pings (such as map
    clicks or voice chat pings) in the group are restricted to specific members. This
    setting affects how and where players can send pings within the group context,
    typically used for controlling communication and positioning feedback during raids
    or dungeons. The restriction mode determines which group members are allowed to
    receive or initiate pings.
  parameters:
  - name: restrictTo
    description: 'An enum value of type RestrictPingsTo that specifies the ping restriction
      policy. Valid values typically include: RESTRICT_PINGS_TO_NONE (all members
      can ping), RESTRICT_PINGS_TO_LEADER (only group leader can ping), and RESTRICT_PINGS_TO_OFFICER
      (only officers and leaders can ping).'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Restrict pings to group leader only
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetRestrictPingsTo(RESTRICT_PINGS_TO_LEADER);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Allow all members to ping
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetRestrictPingsTo(RESTRICT_PINGS_TO_NONE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the group and may affect UI behavior
    in the client. It's typically used in raid environments where controlling ping
    usage is important for coordination and minimizing noise.
  warnings: Ensure that the group exists before calling this method, as calling it
    on a null group pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, changes made
    via this method are not persisted across server restarts unless explicitly saved
    to the database.
