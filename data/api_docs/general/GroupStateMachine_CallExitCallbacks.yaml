  signature: void GroupStateMachine::CallExitCallbacks(GroupState oldState, GroupState
    newState, GroupStateTransition transition)
documentation:
  brief: Invokes all registered exit callbacks for a group state transition.
  description: The CallExitCallbacks method is responsible for executing all registered
    callback functions that are associated with exiting a specific group state. This
    method is typically invoked during group state transitions to ensure proper cleanup
    or notification logic is executed before the group moves to a new state. It takes
    into account the old state, new state, and the transition type to determine which
    callbacks should be triggered. The method does not return any value but plays
    a critical role in maintaining consistency and proper behavior during group lifecycle
    events within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: oldState
    description: The previous state of the group before the transition occurred.
  - name: newState
    description: The target state that the group is transitioning to.
  - name: transition
    description: Represents the type or context of the state transition, such as normal,
      forced, or error conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in State Transition
    code: "void MyGroupHandler::OnGroupStateChange(GroupState oldState, GroupState\
      \ newState, GroupStateTransition transition)\n{\n    groupStateMachine.CallExitCallbacks(oldState,\
      \ newState, transition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Group Logic
    code: "class MyGroupLogic\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleTransition(GroupState oldState,\
      \ GroupState newState)\n    {\n        // Perform pre-transition logic\n   \
      \     groupStateMachine.CallExitCallbacks(oldState, newState, GroupStateTransition::Normal);\n\
      \        // Continue with post-transition logic\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that callbacks are properly registered for the given
    state transition. It is important to ensure that callback registration happens
    before this method is called to avoid missing critical exit logic. The method
    does not handle exceptions thrown by individual callbacks; it simply executes
    them in sequence.
  warnings: If a callback modifies the group or its state during execution, unexpected
    behavior may occur. Ensure that callbacks do not interfere with the internal consistency
    of the group state machine.
