documentation:
  brief: Updates the Monk AI's buff states and applies appropriate healing or damage
    mitigation based on current combat conditions.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and updating the
    state of all applicable buffs for a Monk AI character. It evaluates the current
    health, mana levels, and combat situation to determine which buffs should be active
    or refreshed. This includes checking for beneficial effects like healing over
    time, damage reduction, or mana regeneration that are crucial for optimal performance
    in both PvE and PvP scenarios. The method ensures that the Monk maintains an appropriate
    set of active buffs based on game mechanics and class-specific abilities.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MyMonkAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the AI's periodic update cycle,
    usually every few seconds. It relies on internal state tracking of the Monk's
    health and mana to make decisions about buff activation. The implementation may
    vary depending on the specific subclass or specialization of the Monk AI.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called too frequently as it may cause performance
    issues due to repeated spell checks and state evaluations. Also, avoid calling
    this method outside of the proper AI update context to prevent inconsistent buff
    states.
