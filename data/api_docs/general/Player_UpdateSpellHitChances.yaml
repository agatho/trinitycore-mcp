documentation:
  brief: Updates the spell hit chances for the player based on current stats and abilities.
  description: The UpdateSpellHitChances method recalculates and applies the player's
    spell hit percentage, which determines the likelihood that a spell will successfully
    land on a target without being dodged or resisted. This method is typically invoked
    when the player's stats, talents, or equipment change, ensuring that spell accuracy
    reflects the current game state. The calculation considers base hit chance, expertise,
    buffs, debuffs, and other relevant factors from the TrinityCore engine's combat
    system.

    modified. It's important to note that spell hit chance affects both direct damage
    spells and healing spells, as well as spell procs and effects.
