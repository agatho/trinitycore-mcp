  signature: void Player::InitializeSkillFields()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes all skill fields for the player, setting up default values and
    internal data structures.
  description: The InitializeSkillFields method prepares the player's skill system
    by initializing all relevant skill-related fields and data structures. This includes
    setting up default skill levels, skill caps, and internal tracking variables for
    each skill type. The method is typically called during player creation or login
    to ensure that all skill data is properly initialized before any gameplay operations
    begin. It ensures that the player has a valid skill state that can be modified
    throughout their gameplay experience.

  - title: Basic Usage During Player Login
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    player->InitializeSkillFields();\n\
      \    // Skill fields are now initialized and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during a player's lifecycle, typically
    during character creation or login. Calling it multiple times may result in unexpected
    behavior or data corruption. The initialization process sets up internal arrays
    and structures that are used by other skill-related methods throughout the player's
    session.
