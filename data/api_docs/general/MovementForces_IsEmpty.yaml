  signature: bool MovementForces::IsEmpty() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the movement forces container is empty.
  description: The IsEmpty method determines if the MovementForces object contains
    any active movement forces. It returns true if no forces are currently applied,
    and false if at least one force is present. This method is commonly used in movement
    handling systems to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations
    when no forces are active. The check typically examines internal data structures
    that store force vectors or influence states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the MovementForces container contains no active forces,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for active forces
    code: "MovementForces forces;\nif (forces.IsEmpty()) {\n    // No forces are currently\
      \ applied\n    // Can safely skip movement calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsEmpty in a movement update loop
    code: "void UpdatePlayerMovement(Player* player) {\n    MovementForces& forces\
      \ = player->GetMovementForces();\n    if (forces.IsEmpty()) {\n        // Skip\
      \ expensive force calculations\n        return;\n    }\n    // Apply forces\
      \ and update position\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a constant-time check by examining the size or
    state of internal containers rather than iterating through all forces. It's designed
    to be lightweight for frequent calls during game loop execution.
