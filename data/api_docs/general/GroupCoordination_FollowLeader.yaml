api:
  class: GroupCoordination
  method: FollowLeader
  signature: void GroupCoordination::FollowLeader(uint32 leaderGuid, float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Instructs the group coordination system to have members follow the leader
    at a specified distance.
  description: The FollowLeader method initiates or updates the group following behavior
    for all members of a group, designating a specific player as the leader and setting
    an intended distance for followers to maintain. This method is typically used
    in group management systems to coordinate movement of players within a party or
    raid. It ensures that group members will automatically adjust their position relative
    to the leader based on the provided distance parameter. The implementation likely
    involves updating internal state tracking for each group member's positioning
    and may trigger pathfinding or movement updates to maintain formation.
  parameters:
  - name: leaderGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will serve as the
      group leader. This must correspond to a valid player in the current world context.
  - name: distance
    description: The target distance that followers should maintain from the leader.
      Values are typically in game units (yards/meters). Must be a positive value;
      negative or zero values may result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupCoordination coord;

      coord.FollowLeader(12345, 5.0f); // Leader GUID 12345, follow at 5 units distance'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Group Formation
    code: 'GroupCoordination coord;

      coord.FollowLeader(playerGuid, 3.0f); // Update existing group to follow at
      closer distance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal state updates for all group members
    and may involve pathfinding calculations. It is expected that the leaderGuid refers
    to a player currently in the same world instance. The distance parameter should
    be validated before calling to prevent invalid formations.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the leader GUID corresponds to an
    active player may result in undefined behavior or errors. Repeated calls with
    different distances may cause sudden movement changes for group members, potentially
    disrupting gameplay.
