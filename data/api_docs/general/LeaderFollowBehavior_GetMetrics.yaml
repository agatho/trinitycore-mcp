  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const FollowMetrics & LeaderFollowBehavior::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current follow metrics for the leader-follower behavior.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a constant reference to the FollowMetrics
    structure that contains various statistics and data related to the current leader-follower
    relationship. This includes information such as distance tracking, movement status,
    and other behavioral metrics that define how the follower is currently behaving
    in relation to its leader. The returned metrics are updated dynamically during
    the follow behavior execution and provide insight into the current state of the
    follow system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a FollowMetrics object containing the current metrics
    for the leader-follower behavior. This structure holds data about distance, movement
    status, and other behavioral statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Follow Metrics
    code: 'const FollowMetrics& metrics = leaderFollowBehavior.GetMetrics();

      float distance = metrics.GetCurrentDistance();

      bool isMoving = metrics.IsFollowing();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data structures that are updated
    during the follow behavior execution. Modifications to the returned FollowMetrics
    object should not be made directly as it may affect the internal state of the
    behavior.
