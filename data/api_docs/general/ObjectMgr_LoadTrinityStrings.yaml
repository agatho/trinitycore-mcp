  signature: bool ObjectMgr::LoadTrinityStrings()
documentation:
  brief: Loads Trinity string translations from the database into memory for use in
    game messages and UI elements.
  description: The LoadTrinityStrings method initializes the internal string translation
    system by loading all available trinity strings from the database table 'trinity_string'.
    These strings are used throughout the TrinityCore server to provide localized
    messages, tooltips, and other textual content. The method performs database queries
    to fetch all entries and populates an internal lookup structure for fast access
    during runtime. It should typically be called during server startup before any
    string lookups occur. This method is essential for proper localization support
    and will return false if the database table is missing or empty.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the string translations were successfully loaded from the
    database, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate database connection
    issues, missing table, or empty data in the trinity_string table.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "if (!sObjectMgr->LoadTrinityStrings())\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to load Trinity strings from database\");\n    return false;\n}\nsLog->outString(\"\
      Trinity strings loaded successfully\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during server startup as part of the ObjectMgr
    initialization process. The loaded strings are cached in memory for fast lookup
    and are not reloaded unless explicitly requested. Performance is generally good
    since it's a one-time load operation, but large databases with many string entries
    may take longer to process.
  warnings: Calling this method after server startup may cause issues if string lookups
    are already happening. The method should only be called once during initialization
    phase. If the trinity_string table does not exist or is empty, the method will
    silently return false without throwing an error.
