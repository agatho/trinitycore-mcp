  signature: uint32 AuctionManager::GetMaxRiskScore() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum risk score allowed for auction items in the auction house
    system.
  description: The GetMaxRiskScore method retrieves the upper limit of risk scores
    that can be assigned to auction items within the TrinityCore auction house system.
    This value determines the highest level of risk an item can carry before it becomes
    restricted or banned from being listed. The risk score is typically calculated
    based on factors such as item value, rarity, and potential for abuse or exploitation.
    This method is used internally by the auction manager to enforce game balance
    and prevent exploitation of the auction system. The returned value is a static
    configuration parameter that may be adjusted by server administrators.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum risk score allowed for auction
    items. Items with risk scores exceeding this value will be restricted from being
    listed on the auction house.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Maximum Risk Score
    code: 'uint32 maxRisk = sAuctionMgr->GetMaxRiskScore();

      TC_LOG_INFO("auction", "Maximum risk score allowed: %u", maxRisk);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during auction validation processes to ensure
    items meet the system's risk thresholds. The value returned by this method should
    be consistent across all auction house instances on a given server.
