  class: FlightPathMovementGenerator
  method: GetPath
  signature: const int & FlightPathMovementGenerator::GetPath()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the flight path identifier associated with this movement generator.
  description: The GetPath method retrieves the unique identifier of the flight path
    that this FlightPathMovementGenerator is currently managing. This identifier corresponds
    to an entry in the database table defining flight paths between waypoints, typically
    used for player or creature movement through the air. The returned value represents
    the index or ID of the specific flight path within the game's internal flight
    path system. This method is commonly invoked during movement updates to determine
    which predefined flight route should be followed by the unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the flight path identifier
    (ID) used by this movement generator. The ID maps to a specific entry in the game's
    flight path database table, determining the waypoints and trajectory for the unit's
    movement.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Flight Path ID for Movement
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == FLIGHT_MOTION_TYPE)\n    {\n        FlightPathMovementGenerator* flightGen\
      \ = static_cast<FlightPathMovementGenerator*>(\n            player->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n\
      \        const int& pathId = flightGen->GetPath();\n        // Use pathId to\
      \ determine flight path behavior\n        sLog->outString(\"Current flight path\
      \ ID: %d\", pathId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, meaning the returned value should
    not be modified. The flight path ID is set during initialization of the FlightPathMovementGenerator
    and remains constant throughout its lifetime. This method does not perform any
    validation or error checking on the internal state.
