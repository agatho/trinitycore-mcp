  signature: int HavocDemonHunterRefactored::GetEnemiesInRangeVector(float range)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Counts and returns the number of enemy units within a specified range of
    the Havoc Demon Hunter.
  description: The GetEnemiesInRangeVector method calculates and returns the total
    number of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within the defined range
    around the Havoc Demon Hunter. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    processes to determine threat levels, target selection, or positioning strategies.
    The range parameter defines how far from the hunter's position enemies must be
    to be counted. This functionality is essential for combat behavior logic and ensures
    the demon hunter responds appropriately to surrounding threats. The method does
    not modify any internal state and is read-only.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the count of enemy units found within the specified
    range. Returns zero if no enemies are present in range or if the range value is
    invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Threat Level
    code: "int enemyCount = hunter.GetEnemiesInRangeVector(10.0f);\nif (enemyCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Execute combat behavior\n    hunter.CastAbility(SpellId::FelRush);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Enemy Count for Target Selection Logic
    code: "int range = 8.0f;\nint enemiesInRange = hunter.GetEnemiesInRangeVector(range);\n\
      if (enemiesInRange >= 3)\n{\n    // Use area-of-effect ability\n    hunter.CastAbility(SpellId::EyeBeam);\n\
      }\nelse if (enemiesInRange == 1)\n{\n    // Use single-target ability\n    hunter.CastAbility(SpellId::ThrowGlaive);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial query using the internal AI system's range
    detection logic. It may internally use bounding sphere checks or more complex
    collision detection depending on the implementation. The method is optimized for
    frequent calls during AI update cycles but should not be used excessively in tight
    loops without caching results.
  warnings: The return value represents only enemies currently within range and does
    not account for line-of-sight or other tactical factors. This method may not reflect
    real-time changes if the enemy positions are updated asynchronously. Ensure that
    the range parameter is positive to avoid undefined behavior.
