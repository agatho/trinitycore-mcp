  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: GetExpirationTime
  signature: time_t BlackMarketEntry::GetExpirationTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the expiration time of the black market item as a Unix timestamp.
  description: The GetExpirationTime method retrieves the time at which the black
    market item will expire, represented as a Unix timestamp. This value is used by
    the game server to determine when an item listing should be removed from the black
    market interface. The returned time_t value represents seconds since the Unix
    epoch (January 1, 1970). This method is typically called during black market refresh
    cycles or when checking the status of active auctions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A time_t value representing the expiration time of the black market item
    as a Unix timestamp. Returns 0 if the item has no expiration time set, or if the
    item is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Black Market Item Has Expired
    code: "BlackMarketEntry* entry = sBlackMarketMgr->GetBlackMarketEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    time_t expirationTime = entry->GetExpirationTime();\n   \
      \ if (expirationTime > 0 && expirationTime < time(nullptr))\n    {\n       \
      \ // Item has expired\n        sLog->outString(\"Black Market item has expired.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BlackMarketEntry object is properly initialized
    and contains valid data. The returned time_t value should be compared against
    the current time using standard C++ time functions such as time(nullptr).
