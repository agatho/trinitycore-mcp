  brief: Resets the windwalker hit combo tracker to its initial state.
  description: The Reset method initializes or clears the internal state of the WindwalkerHitComboTracker,
    typically used to reset combo point tracking for a player's abilities. This method
    ensures that any accumulated combo points or tracking data are cleared and the
    tracker is ready to begin a new combo sequence. It is commonly invoked when a
    player's combo state needs to be reset, such as after completing an ability, switching
    targets, or during certain combat transitions in the Windwalker monk class mechanics.

    state consistency. It is typically invoked internally by the core game logic when
    combo point conditions are met or reset.
