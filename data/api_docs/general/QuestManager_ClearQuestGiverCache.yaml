documentation:
  brief: Clears the internal cache of quest givers for the player
  description: The ClearQuestGiverCache method invalidates and removes all cached
    quest giver data from the QuestManager's internal storage. This ensures that subsequent
    requests for quest giver information will fetch fresh data from the database or
    other sources rather than using potentially stale cached values. The method is
    typically invoked when quest giver data has changed or when a player transitions
    between zones where quest availability may have been modified. This helps maintain
    consistency in quest-related interactions within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: player->GetQuestManager()->ClearQuestGiverCache();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it may cause performance overhead
    due to subsequent database queries. It's recommended to use this only when necessary,
    such as after significant quest state changes or zone transitions.
