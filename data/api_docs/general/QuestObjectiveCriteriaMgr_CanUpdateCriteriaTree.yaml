  class: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  method: CanUpdateCriteriaTree
  signature: bool QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::CanUpdateCriteriaTree(const int * criteria,
    const int * tree, int * referencePlayer) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a criteria tree can be updated based on provided criteria
    and reference player.
  description: The CanUpdateCriteriaTree method evaluates if a given criteria tree
    is eligible for an update operation within the quest objective system. It checks
    the validity of the input criteria array, the associated tree structure, and ensures
    that the reference player meets necessary conditions for the update to proceed.
    This method plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency between quest progress,
    player achievements, and objective tracking in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: criteria
    description: Pointer to an array of integers representing criteria identifiers
      that define the conditions to be checked for updating.
  - name: tree
    description: Pointer to an array of integers defining the structure or hierarchy
      of the criteria tree being evaluated.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID used as a reference
      for validation during the update process.
  returns: Returns true if all conditions are met and the criteria tree can be safely
    updated; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "int criteria[] = {101, 102, 103};\nint tree[] = {1, 2, 3};\nint playerId\
      \ = 456;\nbool result = questObjectiveCriteriaMgr->CanUpdateCriteriaTree(criteria,\
      \ tree, &playerId);\nif (result) {\n    // Proceed with updating criteria tree\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before performing any modifications to a
    quest objective criteria tree to prevent invalid or inconsistent updates. It may
    involve checking player state, quest completion status, and other game logic constraints.
  warnings: Ensure that the input arrays are properly initialized and null-terminated
    to avoid undefined behavior. Passing invalid pointers or incorrect data types
    can lead to crashes or unexpected results.
