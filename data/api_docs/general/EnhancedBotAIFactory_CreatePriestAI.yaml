documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new priest AI instance for the specified bot player
  description: The CreatePriestAI method is responsible for instantiating and configuring
    a priest-specific artificial intelligence behavior for a given bot player within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the necessary AI components, including
    spell selection, target prioritization, and combat decision-making logic tailored
    specifically for priest class mechanics such as healing, damage dealing, and support
    abilities. The method ensures that the created AI instance is properly integrated
    with the bot's current state and available resources. It typically handles initialization
    of priest-specific AI parameters like mana management, cooldown tracking, and
    ability usage patterns. Precondition requires a valid Player object representing
    a bot character that has been properly initialized with priest class data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure status of the
    AI creation process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation,
    while negative values may represent various error conditions such as invalid player
    reference, unsupported class type, or insufficient memory allocation for AI components.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Priest AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nint result = factory->CreatePriestAI(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully created\n    printf(\"Priest AI created\
      \ successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ create Priest AI with code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI system which extends standard TrinityCore
    AI functionality. The created AI instance will automatically integrate with the
    bot's existing behavior tree and may require additional setup for specific gameplay
    scenarios. The method assumes that the Player object has already been validated
    and initialized with proper priest class data before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-priest bot player may result in undefined
    behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that the Player object represents a valid priest
    character with appropriate class data loaded. The method does not perform automatic
    cleanup of previously created AI instances, so multiple calls on the same bot
    without proper disposal may lead to memory leaks.
