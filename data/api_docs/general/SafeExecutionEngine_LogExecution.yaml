  class: SafeExecutionEngine
  method: LogExecution
  signature: void SafeExecutionEngine::LogExecution(int * stmt, bool success, uint32
    durationMs)
documentation:
  brief: Logs execution details including statement pointer, success status, and duration
    for performance monitoring.
  description: The LogExecution method records execution metrics for database statements
    within the SafeExecutionEngine. It logs information about whether a statement
    executed successfully, the time taken in milliseconds, and the statement's memory
    address. This functionality is crucial for debugging, performance analysis, and
    monitoring database query efficiency in TrinityCore. The method does not modify
    any state but rather serves as a diagnostic tool to track execution behavior of
    SQL operations.
  parameters:
  - name: stmt
    description: Pointer to the database statement being logged. This represents the
      SQL statement object that was executed, used for tracking and debugging purposes.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the statement execution was successful
      (true) or failed (false). Used to categorize performance metrics.
  - name: durationMs
    description: Execution time in milliseconds for the database statement. Helps
      identify slow-running queries and performance bottlenecks.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int* queryStmt = nullptr;

      bool executionSuccess = true;

      uint32 executionTime = 150;

      SafeExecutionEngine::LogExecution(queryStmt, executionSuccess, executionTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "void MonitorQueryPerformance(const char* query, uint32 duration) {\n  \
      \  int* stmt = nullptr; // Assume this is initialized with actual statement\n\
      \    bool success = (duration < 1000); // Simple success criteria\n    SafeExecutionEngine::LogExecution(stmt,\
      \ success, duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in debug builds or performance monitoring systems.
    It may be disabled in release builds for performance reasons. The statement pointer
    should be valid and not null to ensure meaningful logging.
  warnings: Ensure that the statement pointer is valid before calling this method,
    as dereferencing an invalid pointer could cause crashes. The duration value should
    represent actual execution time and not include overhead from other operations.
