documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GarrisonMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GarrisonMgr class is responsible for cleaning
    up all internal data structures, releasing allocated memory, and ensuring that
    any garrison-related resources are properly deallocated when the manager instance
    is destroyed. This method is automatically invoked when a GarrisonMgr object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no memory leaks occur and
    that all garrison-related systems are correctly terminated without leaving dangling
    references or corrupted state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of GarrisonMgr instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    GarrisonMgr* garrisonMgr = new GarrisonMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use garrisonMgr ...\n    delete garrisonMgr; // Destructor is called\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations such as releasing references to
    garrison data, clearing internal caches, and ensuring that no dangling pointers
    remain. It's important to note that this method should not be called manually
    unless the object was dynamically allocated.
