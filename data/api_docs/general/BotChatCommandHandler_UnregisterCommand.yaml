documentation:
  brief: Unregisters a previously registered bot chat command by its name
  description: The UnregisterCommand method removes a previously registered chat command
    from the BotChatCommandHandler's command registry. This allows for dynamic management
    of available commands at runtime, which is particularly useful in bot systems
    where commands may need to be enabled or disabled based on context or configuration.
    The method performs a lookup by command name and removes the associated handler
    if found. If the command does not exist, the method returns false without performing
    any action.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The exact string name of the command to unregister. This must match
      the command name used during registration, including case sensitivity.
  returns: Returns true if the command was successfully found and unregistered, false
    if the command name does not exist in the registry.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Unregistration
    code: "BotChatCommandHandler handler;\n// Assume \"help\" command was previously\
      \ registered\nbool success = handler.UnregisterCommand(\"help\");\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Command successfully removed\n    std::cout << \"Command unregistered\
      \ successfully\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Command not found\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Command not found\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Unregistration with Error Handling
    code: "BotChatCommandHandler handler;\nstd::string commandName = \"debug\";\n\
      if (handler.UnregisterCommand(commandName)) {\n    // Command was successfully\
      \ removed\n    sLog->outString(\"Successfully unregistered command: %s\", commandName.c_str());\n\
      } else {\n    // Command was not found in registry\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to unregister command: %s - not found\", commandName.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that command names are unique and case-sensitive. The
    implementation likely uses a map or similar data structure internally for O(log
    n) lookup performance. This method should be used carefully in multi-threaded
    environments where commands might be registered or unregistered concurrently.
  warnings: Unregistering a command that is currently in use or referenced by active
    bots may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure all references to the command are
    cleared before unregistering it. Also, be aware that this method does not validate
    whether the command was actually registered previously - it simply attempts removal.
