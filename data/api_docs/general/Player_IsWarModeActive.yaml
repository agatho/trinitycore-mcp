documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently in war mode state.
  description: This method checks if the player character is in war mode, which is
    a special state that can be activated when entering certain zones or through specific
    game mechanics. War mode typically enables PvP combat and affects various gameplay
    behaviors including player vs player interactions, loot distribution, and other
    combat-related features. The method returns true when the player is in war mode
    and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is in war mode state, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the player's current game state allows for PvP combat and related
    mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsWarModeActive()) {\n    // Player is in war mode\n    //\
      \ Perform actions that require war mode\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player state checks
    to determine if a player can engage in PvP combat or if certain game mechanics
    are active. It's important to note that war mode status may be influenced by zone
    restrictions, player level requirements, or specific game events.
  warnings: Be aware that war mode status might change based on game updates or zone
    restrictions. This method should not be used as the sole determinant for PvP combat
    eligibility, as additional checks are required for full gameplay compliance.
