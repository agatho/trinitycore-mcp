api:
  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleServerTimeOffsetRequest
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleServerTimeOffsetRequest(WorldPackets::Misc::ServerTimeOffsetRequest
    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles client requests for server time offset information to synchronize
    local time with the server.
  description: This method processes incoming requests from clients for server time
    offset data, which is used to synchronize the client's local clock with the server's
    authoritative time. It typically responds by sending back the current server time
    and the time difference between the client and server clocks. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining accurate timestamps in game events, such as cooldowns,
    auctions, and other time-sensitive mechanics that depend on synchronized timing
    across all connected clients.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A packet containing the client's request for server time offset information.
      This parameter is typically a WorldPackets::Misc::ServerTimeOffsetRequest object
      that encapsulates the request data sent by the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleServerTimeOffsetRequest(WorldPackets::Misc::ServerTimeOffsetRequest\
      \ &request)\n{\n    // Process the request and send back time offset\n    SendServerTimeOffset();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the session management system and should be called
    automatically when a client sends a server time offset request. It's important
    to ensure that the server time is accurately maintained for proper synchronization
    with clients.
