documentation:
  brief: Activates the Mage's Invisibility spell for the AI-controlled mage.
  description: The UseInvisibility method triggers the casting of the Invisibility
    spell on an AI-controlled mage character. This method is typically invoked by
    the MageAI class to manage the mage's ability usage during combat or non-combat
    scenarios. It handles the logic required to initiate the invisibility effect,
    which makes the mage undetectable by enemies and removes them from enemy aggro.
    The method likely checks for spell availability, mana requirements, and cooldowns
    before executing the spell cast.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void SomeMageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_mage->GetHealth()\
      \ < m_mage->GetMaxHealth() / 2)\n    {\n        m_mage->UseInvisibility();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MageAI behavior system and should only be called
    on AI-controlled mage units. It assumes that the unit has the Invisibility spell
    available in its spell list and sufficient mana to cast it.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-mage or non-AI controlled unit may result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure the target unit is properly initialized with the
    MageAI component before invoking this method.
