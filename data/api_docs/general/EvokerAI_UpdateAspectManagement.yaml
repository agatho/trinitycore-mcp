  class: EvokerAI
  method: UpdateAspectManagement
  signature: void EvokerAI::UpdateAspectManagement()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the evoker's aspect abilities, including casting, updating cooldowns,
    and handling aspect transitions.
  description: The UpdateAspectManagement method is responsible for controlling the
    evoker's aspect abilities within the TrinityCore AI framework. It evaluates the
    current state of the evoker's aspects, determines whether new aspects should be
    cast or existing ones updated, and manages their cooldowns and duration timers.
    This method typically runs during each AI update cycle to ensure that the evoker
    maintains optimal aspect usage based on combat conditions and available resources.
    The implementation may consider factors such as target threat levels, player health,
    mana availability, and tactical positioning when making decisions about aspect
    management.

  - title: Basic Aspect Management Update
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAspectManagement()\n{\n    // Core logic to update\
      \ aspect states\n    if (m_aspectCooldownTimer <= 0)\n    {\n        CastAspect();\n\
      \        m_aspectCooldownTimer = GetAspectCooldown();\n    }\n    else\n   \
      \ {\n        m_aspectCooldownTimer -= UpdateInterval;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main AI update loop and should
    not block or perform heavy computations. It's designed to be lightweight and responsive
    to changing combat conditions.
  warnings: Improper implementation of aspect cooldown handling may lead to spam casting
    or missed aspect opportunities. Ensure that all aspect transitions properly account
    for player state and resource constraints.
