documentation:
  brief: Checks if the complaint system is enabled in the TrinityCore server configuration.
  description: The GetComplaintSystemStatus method retrieves the current status of
    the complaint system within the TrinityCore server. This system allows players
    to submit complaints about other players or game issues through the in-game interface.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating whether this feature is currently
    active or disabled based on server configuration settings. This check is typically
    used before allowing players to submit complaints or displaying complaint-related
    UI elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the complaint system is enabled, false if it is disabled.
    The method does not throw exceptions and always returns a valid boolean value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (sSupportMgr->GetComplaintSystemStatus()) {\n    // Complaint system\
      \ is active, allow player to submit complaints\n    SendComplaintUI();\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Complaint system is disabled, show appropriate message\n    SendSystemDisabledMessage();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Command
    code: "void HandleComplaintStatusCommand(ChatHandler* handler) {\n    bool status\
      \ = sSupportMgr->GetComplaintSystemStatus();\n    if (status) {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Complaint system is currently enabled.\");\n    } else {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Complaint system is currently disabled.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple configuration check and has no performance
    impact. It's thread-safe as it only reads static configuration values. The actual
    complaint submission logic may have additional validation checks beyond this status
    check.
  warnings: The return value should not be used as the sole validation for complaint
    submissions, as additional server-side checks may be required. This method only
    reflects the server configuration and does not account for runtime system states
    or player permissions.
