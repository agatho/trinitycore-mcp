  class: KitingManager
  method: GetRetreatPosition
  signature: int KitingManager::GetRetreatPosition(const int & threats, float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal retreat position based on threat level
    and distance.
  description: The GetRetreatPosition method determines the best location for a player
    or NPC to retreat from an active threat situation. It evaluates the current threat
    level and desired retreat distance to compute a suitable position that ensures
    safety while maintaining tactical positioning. This method is typically used in
    AI behavior systems where kiting mechanics are implemented, such as when a creature
    needs to move away from a target without losing line of sight or engaging in harmful
    combat. The method assumes valid input parameters and does not perform explicit
    validation.
  parameters:
  - name: threats
    description: An integer representing the current threat level or number of hostile
      targets. Higher values typically indicate more dangerous situations requiring
      immediate retreat.
  - name: distance
    description: A floating-point value indicating how far the entity should retreat
      from the threat source. This distance is usually measured in yards or game units.
  returns: Returns an integer identifier representing the calculated retreat position,
    likely a GUID or index used to reference the computed location within the AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Retreat Calculation
    code: int retreatPos = kitingManager.GetRetreatPosition(5, 10.0f); // Retreat
      from 5 threats by 10 yards
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Retreat Based on Threat
    code: 'int threatLevel = player->GetThreatLevel();

      float retreatDistance = threatLevel * 2.0f;

      int retreatPos = kitingManager.GetRetreatPosition(threatLevel, retreatDistance);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger kiting AI system and may depend on
    internal state tracking such as current position, target location, and environmental
    obstacles. The exact algorithm for calculating the retreat position is not specified
    but probably involves vector math to determine safe escape routes.
  warnings: Ensure that the threat level parameter is non-negative and that distance
    is a positive value. Invalid inputs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    positioning calculations.
