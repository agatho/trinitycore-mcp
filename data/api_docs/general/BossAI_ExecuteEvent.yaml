  class: BossAI
  method: ExecuteEvent
  signature: void BossAI::ExecuteEvent(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the next scheduled event in the boss's AI event queue
  description: The ExecuteEvent method is responsible for processing and executing
    the next pending event within a BossAI instance's event queue. This method is
    typically called during the AI update cycle to handle timed events, spell casts,
    or other scripted behaviors that occur at specific intervals or conditions. It
    manages the execution flow of boss encounters by determining which event should
    be processed next based on timing and priority. The method ensures proper sequencing
    of boss abilities and mechanics during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that typically represents the event ID or type
      to execute, though exact usage may vary depending on implementation details
      within specific boss AI scripts.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Event Execution
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n     \
      \   return;\n\n    // Execute scheduled events\n    ExecuteEvent(0);\n\n   \
      \ DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event-Based Boss AI Update
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n     \
      \   return;\n\n    // Handle event timing\n    if (events.Delay(5000))\n   \
      \     ExecuteEvent(1);\n\n    DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the UpdateAI() function of BossAI
    subclasses. It's important to note that event execution order and timing are managed
    by the underlying event system, which may be implemented using a priority queue
    or similar structure. The parameter value passed to ExecuteEvent is usually determined
    by the boss AI script logic.
  warnings: Improper handling of event IDs can lead to incorrect behavior or missing
    abilities in boss encounters. Ensure that all event types are properly registered
    and handled within the boss AI implementation before calling ExecuteEvent with
    specific parameters.
