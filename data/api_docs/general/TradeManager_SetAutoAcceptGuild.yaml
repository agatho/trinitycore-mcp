documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic guild trade acceptance for the player.
  description: The SetAutoAcceptGuild method configures whether the player will automatically
    accept guild trade requests from other players. When enabled, incoming guild trades
    are accepted without manual confirmation. When disabled, guild trades require
    explicit user approval before being processed. This functionality is part of the
    broader trading system within TrinityCore's game mechanics and affects how guild
    members interact during trade operations.

  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Accept Guild Trades
    code: 'TradeManager* tradeMgr = player->GetTradeData();

      tradeMgr->SetAutoAcceptGuild(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto-Accept Guild Trades
    code: 'TradeManager* tradeMgr = player->GetTradeData();

      tradeMgr->SetAutoAcceptGuild(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags within the TradeManager class and
    does not directly communicate with the game server or database. The setting persists
    for the duration of the player session but is not saved across logouts.
  warnings: Setting this to true may lead to unintended trades if the player is not
    careful, especially when trading with guild members who might send unwanted items.
    It's recommended to use this feature only in controlled environments or when fully
    aware of its implications.
