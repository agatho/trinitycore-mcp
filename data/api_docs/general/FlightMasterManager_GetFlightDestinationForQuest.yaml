documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flight destination ID associated with a specific quest.
  description: The GetFlightDestinationForQuest method is used to determine the flight
    destination that is linked to a given quest ID. This functionality is typically
    employed in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to manage quest-related
    flight paths, such as when a player completes a quest that grants access to a
    new flight path or teleportation point. The method acts as a lookup mechanism,
    mapping quest identifiers to corresponding flight destination identifiers within
    the game's internal data structures. It is commonly used during quest completion
    events or when checking if a player has unlocked a specific flight route through
    quest progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier (ID) of the flight
    destination associated with the specified quest. If no flight destination is linked
    to the given quest ID, the method may return zero or an invalid ID, indicating
    that no flight path is available for that particular quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nuint32 destinationId = flightMasterManager.GetFlightDestinationForQuest(questId);\n\
      if (destinationId != 0)\n{\n    // Process the flight destination\n    printf(\"\
      Flight destination ID: %u\\n\", destinationId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal quest-to-flight-destination mappings
    stored in the database or memory structures. It should be used carefully during
    quest completion or flight path validation logic to ensure proper behavior and
    avoid invalid ID lookups.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided questId is valid before calling this method,
    as an invalid quest ID may result in unexpected behavior or incorrect return values.
    The returned destination ID must also be validated before being used for actual
    flight operations.
