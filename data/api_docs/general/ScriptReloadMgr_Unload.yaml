  signature: void ScriptReloadMgr::Unload()
documentation:
  brief: Unloads all loaded scripts from the ScriptReloadMgr system
  description: The Unload method removes and cleans up all currently loaded script
    components within the ScriptReloadMgr system. This operation typically occurs
    when reloading scripts dynamically during runtime, ensuring that previously loaded
    scripts are properly deallocated and their resources freed. The method is designed
    to be safe for use in live environments where script reloading is required without
    server restarts. It performs necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks
    and ensures a clean state before new scripts can be loaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Script Unloading
    code: ScriptReloadMgr::instance()->Unload();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the system is in a state where script
    unloading is safe. It's typically invoked before calling Load() or as part of
    a larger script reloading sequence. The operation may take some time depending
    on the number of loaded scripts.
  warnings: Calling this method while scripts are actively executing may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always ensure that no script execution is in progress before
    invoking Unload().
