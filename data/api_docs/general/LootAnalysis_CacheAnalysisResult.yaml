  class: LootAnalysis
  method: CacheAnalysisResult
  signature: void LootAnalysis::CacheAnalysisResult(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item, const ItemAnalysisResult & result)
documentation:
  brief: Caches the analysis result of a loot item for a specific player.
  description: The CacheAnalysisResult method stores the outcome of an item analysis
    performed on a specific loot item for a given player. This cached data can be
    used later to avoid recomputing the same analysis, improving performance during
    loot evaluation processes. The method is typically invoked when a player examines
    a loot item and the system determines its value or properties for further processing.
    It ensures that subsequent requests for the same item's analysis can retrieve
    precomputed results efficiently.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the loot item analysis is being
      cached. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      item being analyzed. Represents the specific loot item in question.
  - name: result
    description: Reference to an ItemAnalysisResult object that holds the computed
      analysis data for the specified loot item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      LootItem lootItem = ...;

      ItemAnalysisResult analysisResult = ...;

      LootAnalysis::CacheAnalysisResult(player, lootItem, analysisResult);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided parameters are valid and not null.
    The caching mechanism likely uses internal data structures to associate results
    with player and item identifiers. Performance gains are realized when multiple
    analyses of the same item for the same player occur.
