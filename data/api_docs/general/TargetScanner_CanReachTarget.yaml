  method: CanReachTarget
  signature: bool TargetScanner::CanReachTarget(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the scanner's unit can reach a specified target unit using
    pathfinding.
  description: The CanReachTarget method evaluates if a Unit (typically an AI-controlled
    creature or player) can successfully navigate to a given target unit within the
    game world. It performs pathfinding checks to determine if a valid route exists
    between the scanner's unit and the target, considering obstacles, terrain, and
    movement constraints. This method is commonly used in AI decision-making processes
    to decide whether to pursue a target, cast spells that require line of sight,
    or engage in combat. The result is typically used to filter out targets that are
    unreachable due to environmental barriers or movement limitations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the scanner's unit can reach the target unit via valid
    pathfinding; returns false otherwise. This includes cases where the target is
    out of range, obstructed by terrain, or otherwise unreachable due to movement
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (scanner.CanReachTarget(targetUnit)) {\n    // Proceed with attack or\
      \ movement\n    unit->Attack(targetUnit);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative\
      \ target or wait\n    unit->SetTarget(nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in spell targeting logic
    code: "if (scanner.CanReachTarget(target)) {\n    // Cast spell that requires\
      \ line of sight and reach\n    caster->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Select a different target or move closer\n    scanner.SetTarget(findClosestReachableTarget());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying pathfinding system of TrinityCore and
    may be computationally expensive if called frequently. It considers unit bounding
    boxes, collision detection, and world geometry to determine reachability. The
    method does not account for dynamic obstacles that might appear during execution.
  warnings: Do not assume that a target is reachable just because it's within visual
    range; pathfinding checks are necessary for accurate reachability determination.
    This method may return false even when the target is visible but blocked by an
    obstacle such as a wall or gap in terrain.
