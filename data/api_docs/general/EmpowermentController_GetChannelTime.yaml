  class: EmpowermentController
  method: GetChannelTime
  signature: int EmpowermentController::GetChannelTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the channel time value from the empowerment controller.
  description: The GetChannelTime method returns an integer representing the current
    channel time setting within the EmpowermentController. This value typically corresponds
    to the duration or time interval over which a channelled spell or effect is active.
    The method is const, indicating it does not modify any internal state of the controller.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with channelled abilities where timing and duration
    are crucial for gameplay mechanics such as mana regeneration, spell casting, or
    aura application.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the channel time in milliseconds or game
    ticks. The exact unit depends on how the EmpowermentController is implemented
    within the TrinityCore framework. A return value of zero may indicate no active
    channel or an uninitialized state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int channelTime = controller->GetChannelTime();\nif (channelTime > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with logic based on channel time\n    std::cout << \"Channel\
      \ time is: \" << channelTime << \" ms\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Channel Time for Spell Logic
    code: "class MySpellHandler\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleChanneling(Player* player,\
      \ EmpowermentController* controller)\n    {\n        int channelTime = controller->GetChannelTime();\n\
      \        if (channelTime > 0 && player->HasAura(12345)) // Example aura ID\n\
      \        {\n            // Apply logic based on channel time\n            player->ModifyPower(POWER_MANA,\
      \ -channelTime / 100); // Reduce mana over time\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from a const member variable.
    The returned value should be interpreted in the context of the specific channelled
    ability or effect that uses this controller. Consider caching the result if it's
    accessed frequently within tight loops to avoid repeated calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the EmpowermentController instance is valid before calling
    this method, as accessing a null pointer will lead to undefined behavior. Also,
    be aware that the returned value may vary depending on game state or player conditions
    (e.g., buffs/debuffs affecting channel duration).
