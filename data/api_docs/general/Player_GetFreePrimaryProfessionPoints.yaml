documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of free primary profession points available to the player.
  description: This method retrieves the count of primary profession points that are
    freely available to the player for allocation. These points represent the total
    number of skill points that can be spent on primary professions without any cost
    or restriction, typically used in conjunction with the GetPrimaryProfessionPoints()
    method to determine how many points remain unspent. The value returned is usually
    determined by the player's level and class-specific bonuses, and may be influenced
    by various game mechanics such as talent trees or achievements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the number of free primary profession points
    available to the player. This value typically corresponds to the total skill point
    allocation that can be used for primary professions, excluding any spent points.
  examples:

    code: 'uint32 freePoints = player->GetFreePrimaryProfessionPoints();

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that track
    spent profession points. It may be affected by game mechanics such as level-based
    bonuses or class-specific skill point allocations.
