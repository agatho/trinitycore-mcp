  signature: void Group::SetLfgRoles(int guid, int roles)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the LFG roles for a group member identified by GUID
  description: The SetLfgRoles method assigns specific Looking For Group (LFG) roles
    to a player within a group. This functionality is used in World of Warcraft's
    group finding system to indicate a player's preferred or available role (such
    as tank, healer, or damage dealer) for dungeon or raid encounters. The method
    updates internal group data structures to reflect the new role assignment for
    the specified group member. This change affects how the player appears in LFG
    queues and how they are matched with other players seeking specific roles.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member whose LFG roles
      are being set
  - name: roles
    description: Bitmask value representing the LFG roles assigned to the player (e.g.,
      1 for tank, 2 for healer, 4 for damage dealer)
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Set a player as both tank and healer
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetLfgRoles(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ 3); // 1 (tank) + 2 (healer)\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Set a player as damage dealer only
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetLfgRoles(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ 4); // 4 (damage dealer only)\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'This method directly modifies the internal LFG role state of a group member.
    It should be called when a player''s role preference changes during gameplay,
    such as after selecting roles in the LFG interface or when switching specs. The
    roles parameter uses bitmasks where each bit represents a specific role type:
    1 = tank, 2 = healer, 4 = damage dealer.'
  warnings: This method should only be called on players who are actually part of
    a group. Calling it on non-group members may result in undefined behavior or data
    corruption. The GUID parameter must be the counter portion of the player's GUID
    as returned by GetCounter().
