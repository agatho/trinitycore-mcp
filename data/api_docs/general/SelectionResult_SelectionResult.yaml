documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SelectionResult object with default values.
  description: The SelectionResult constructor initializes a new instance of the SelectionResult
    class, setting up internal state for storing selection-related data. This method
    is typically used when creating selection results for game entities such as players,
    NPCs, or objects within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor ensures that
    all member variables are properly initialized to their default states, which may
    include resetting flags, clearing result data, or preparing internal buffers for
    subsequent operations. This initialization is crucial for maintaining data integrity
    when handling selections in game mechanics like target acquisition, loot distribution,
    or quest progression.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Construction of SelectionResult
    code: 'SelectionResult result;

      // result is now initialized with default values

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SelectionResult in a Target Selection Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerTargeting(Player* player) {\n    SelectionResult selection;\n\
      \    // Use selection to store target data\n    selection.SetTarget(player->GetGUID());\n\
      \    // Process the selection result\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor performs minimal initialization and does not perform any
    complex operations. It is recommended to call other methods on the SelectionResult
    object immediately after construction to populate it with meaningful data. This
    class likely serves as part of a larger selection system within TrinityCore's
    AI or combat mechanics.
  warnings: Since this is a constructor, it should not be called manually on existing
    objects. The SelectionResult object must be properly constructed before use to
    avoid undefined behavior. Be cautious when using this in performance-critical
    code paths where frequent construction/destruction may impact performance.
