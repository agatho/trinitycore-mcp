  description: The RefundPower method handles the refund of mana, rage, or energy
    resources back to the spell caster when a spell is interrupted or fails. This
    method ensures that the player's power resources are properly restored when spells
    are not successfully cast. It typically occurs during spell cancellation, interrupt,
    or failure scenarios and is crucial for maintaining game balance and resource
    management in World of Warcraft mechanics.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

  notes: This method is typically called during spell interruption or failure scenarios.
    The refund mechanism ensures proper resource management and prevents resource
    loss during failed spell casts.
  warnings: The method should only be called when a spell is actually being refunded,
    as calling it inappropriately may cause resource over-refund or incorrect power
    restoration.
