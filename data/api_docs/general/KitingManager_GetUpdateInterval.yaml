  class: KitingManager
  method: GetUpdateInterval
  signature: uint32 KitingManager::GetUpdateInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update interval in milliseconds used by the kiting manager for
    pathfinding and movement updates.
  description: The GetUpdateInterval method retrieves the time interval (in milliseconds)
    at which the KitingManager performs its periodic updates for kiting behavior.
    This interval determines how frequently the manager evaluates the player's position,
    checks for obstacles, and adjusts movement paths to maintain optimal kiting distance
    from targets. The value is typically configured based on game mechanics and performance
    considerations to balance responsiveness with system efficiency. This method does
    not modify any internal state and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the update interval in milliseconds. This indicates
    how often the kiting manager should perform its periodic checks and adjustments
    during active kiting sessions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 interval = kitingManager->GetUpdateInterval();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Kiting update interval: %u ms", interval);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Interval for Timing Logic
    code: 'uint32 interval = kitingManager->GetUpdateInterval();

      uint32 nextUpdate = getMSTime() + interval;

      // Schedule next kiting update at this time'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned value is typically a constant or configurable parameter that
    affects the smoothness of kiting behavior. Lower intervals provide more responsive
    updates but increase CPU usage. This method is designed to be lightweight and
    should not block execution.
