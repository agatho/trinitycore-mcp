  brief: Adds a player to the skillup list for this game object
  description: This method adds a player to the skillup list for the game object,
    allowing the player to gain skill points when interacting with the object. The
    method is typically used during quest completion or when a player interacts with
    a game object that provides skillup opportunities. It ensures that the player's
    skill progress is properly tracked and updated based on their interaction with
    the object.
  parameters:
  - name: PlayerGuidLow
    description: The low GUID of the player who will be added to the skillup list.
      This represents the unique identifier for the player in the database, typically
      used for tracking player interactions with game objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      Player* player = new Player();

      int playerGuidLow = player->GetGUIDLow();

      go->AddToSkillupList(playerGuidLow);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called when a player interacts with a game object
    during quest completion or skill gain events. It's important to note that the
    player must be in the same zone as the game object for skillup to occur properly.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context, as it
    may cause issues if the player is not properly initialized or if the game object
    has already been interacted with. It's recommended to use this method only when
    the player is actively interacting with the object.
