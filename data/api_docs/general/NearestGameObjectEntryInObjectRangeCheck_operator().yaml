documentation:
  brief: Checks if a GameObject with the specified entry ID is within range of the
    object.
  description: The operator() method of NearestGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck is
    used to evaluate whether a GameObject with a given entry ID exists within a specified
    range from the object that initiated the check. This class is typically employed
    in game logic where it's necessary to locate nearby GameObjects, such as quest
    objectives or interactive objects, without requiring a full scan of all GameObjects
    in the world. The method returns true if a matching GameObject is found within
    range, and false otherwise. It's commonly used in conjunction with container classes
    that iterate through objects to find those meeting certain criteria.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a GameObject with the specified entry ID is found within
    the defined range of the object; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest objective checking
    code: "NearestGameObjectEntryInObjectRangeCheck check(player, 17000);\nif (check(&gameObjectId))\
      \ {\n    // A GameObject with entry ID 17000 is nearby\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a functor pattern used in TrinityCore's object searching
    system. It relies on internal range calculations and may be optimized for performance
    by caching spatial data. The method assumes that the object being checked (e.g.,
    player or creature) has valid position coordinates.
