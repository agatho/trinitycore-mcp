  class: CalendarMgr
  method: SendCalendarEventStatus
  signature: void CalendarMgr::SendCalendarEventStatus(const CalendarEvent & calendarEvent,
    const CalendarInvite & invite) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar event status update to the player who invited another player
    to an event.
  description: The SendCalendarEventStatus method is responsible for notifying players
    about the status of calendar events they have been invited to. It sends a packet
    containing the event details and the invite status (such as accepted, declined,
    or tentative) to the player who originally sent the invitation. This method ensures
    that all participants in a calendar event are kept informed of each other's responses
    and helps maintain synchronization between players' calendar views within the
    game. The method operates on a provided CalendarEvent and CalendarInvite object,
    using their data to construct and send the appropriate status update packet.
  parameters:
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: The calendar event for which the status update is being sent. This
      contains all relevant information about the event such as title, description,
      start time, and other properties.
  - name: invite
    description: The calendar invite object representing the invitation to the event.
      This includes details about who was invited, their current status (accepted,
      declined, etc.), and when they responded.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Calendar Event Status Update
    code: "void SendCalendarEventStatusExample()\n{\n    CalendarEvent event;\n  \
      \  CalendarInvite invite;\n    \n    // Assume event and invite are populated\
      \ with valid data\n    calendarMgr->SendCalendarEventStatus(event, invite);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the calendar system when an
    invite status changes. It's important to ensure that both the CalendarEvent and
    CalendarInvite objects passed to this method contain valid data to prevent sending
    malformed packets or incorrect information to players.
