    area_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell area map bounds for a specified area ID.
  description: This method retrieves the SpellAreaForAreaMapBounds structure associated
    with the given area ID. It is used internally by the TrinityCore spell system
    to determine which spells are valid in specific areas. The returned structure
    typically contains information about spell restrictions, requirements, and conditions
    that apply to the specified area. This functionality supports dynamic spell activation
    based on player location and area-specific rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellAreaForAreaMapBounds object containing all spell area data for the
    specified area ID. Returns an empty or default-constructed structure if no spell
    area data exists for the given area ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve spell area bounds for a specific area
    code: "uint32 areaId = 1234;\nSpellAreaForAreaMapBounds bounds = sSpellMgr->GetSpellAreaForAreaMapBounds(areaId);\n\
      if (!bounds.empty()) {\n    // Process spell area data\n    for (auto& entry\
      \ : bounds) {\n        // Access individual spell area entries\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell validation and area-based spell
    restriction checks. The returned SpellAreaForAreaMapBounds object may be empty
    if no spells are defined for the given area ID. This method is thread-safe as
    it only performs read operations on internal data structures.
