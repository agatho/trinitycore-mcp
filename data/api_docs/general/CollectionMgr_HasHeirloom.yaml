  brief: Checks if a player has a specific heirloom in their collection.
  description: The HasHeirloom method determines whether a player possesses a particular
    heirloom item within their collection. This method is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore to verify the existence of heirloom items, which are
    special legendary items that can be collected and upgraded by players. The check
    is performed against the player's current collection state, including any heirlooms
    that have been acquired through various means such as quest completion, world
    events, or achievements. This functionality supports game mechanics related to
    character progression and item management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified heirloom item is present in the player's
    collection; otherwise returns false.
