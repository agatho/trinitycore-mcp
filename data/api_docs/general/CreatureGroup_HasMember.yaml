  class: CreatureGroup
  method: HasMember
  signature: bool CreatureGroup::HasMember(Creature * member) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified creature is a member of this creature group.
  description: The HasMember method determines whether a given Creature object is
    currently part of the creature group. This method performs a lookup within the
    internal collection of creatures that belong to the group, returning true if the
    specified creature is found and false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, creature groups are used to manage AI behavior for mobs that should
    act together, such as patrols or coordinated attacks. The method is typically
    used during AI updates or group management operations to verify membership status
    before performing actions like adding or removing creatures from the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified Creature pointer refers to a creature that
    is currently a member of this creature group; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Creature* target = ...; // Some creature\nif (creatureGroup->HasMember(target))\
      \ {\n    // Target is part of the group\n    // Perform group-specific actions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Group Behavior
    code: "Creature* newMember = ...; // New creature to add\nif (!creatureGroup->HasMember(newMember))\
      \ {\n    // Creature is not in the group, so we can safely add it\n    creatureGroup->AddMember(newMember);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the internal member list of
    the creature group. For large groups, this operation may have performance implications.
    The method assumes that the Creature pointer passed is valid and not null, though
    no explicit null checking is performed.
  warnings: Be cautious when calling HasMember on creatures that might have been destroyed
    or removed from the world. Using a dangling pointer can lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. Always ensure the creature object remains valid before calling
    this method.
