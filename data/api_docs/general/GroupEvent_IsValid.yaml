  class: GroupEvent
  method: IsValid
  signature: bool GroupEvent::IsValid() const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the group event object is in a consistent and usable state.
  description: The IsValid method checks if the GroupEvent object has been properly
    initialized and contains valid data. It verifies internal consistency of the event's
    state, ensuring that required fields are populated and that the event can be safely
    used in game logic operations. This method is typically called before performing
    operations on the group event to prevent undefined behavior or crashes. The validation
    includes checking for null pointers, valid identifiers, and proper initialization
    of all event-related properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GroupEvent object is in a valid state and can be safely
    used; returns false if the object is invalid or uninitialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "GroupEvent* event = new GroupEvent();\nif (event->IsValid()) {\n    //\
      \ Safe to use the event\n    event->Execute();\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ event\n    delete event;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Event Processing Loop
    code: "for (auto& groupEvent : eventQueue) {\n    if (groupEvent.IsValid()) {\n\
      \        groupEvent.Process();\n    } else {\n        // Log error and skip\
      \ invalid event\n        sLog->outError(\"Invalid group event encountered\"\
      );\n        continue;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight validation check and should not be called
    excessively in performance-critical sections. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific type of group event being validated, but generally involves checking
    for null pointers, valid GUIDs, and proper initialization flags.
  warnings: Do not assume that a GroupEvent object is valid after construction without
    calling IsValid(). Invalid objects can cause crashes or undefined behavior when
    used in game logic operations.
