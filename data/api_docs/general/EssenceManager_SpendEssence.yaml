  method: SpendEssence
  signature: void EssenceManager::SpendEssence(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Reduces the player's essence resource by the specified amount.
  description: The SpendEssence method is used to deduct a given quantity of essence
    from the player's current essence pool. This method typically represents the consumption
    of essence for abilities, spells, or other game mechanics that require essence
    as a resource. It ensures that the player has sufficient essence before deduction
    and may trigger related events or updates in the game state. The method does not
    return any value but modifies the internal essence counter of the player.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The positive integer amount of essence to be spent. Must be greater
      than zero and less than or equal to the player's current essence balance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Essence Spending
    code: 'EssenceManager* manager = player->GetEssenceManager();

      manager->SpendEssence(10); // Deducts 10 essence from the player''s pool'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Essence Spending
    code: "EssenceManager* manager = player->GetEssenceManager();\nif (manager->GetEssence()\
      \ >= 25) {\n    manager->SpendEssence(25); // Spend 25 essence if player has\
      \ enough\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player has sufficient essence
    to avoid negative balances. Implementation may include checks for valid essence
    amounts and potential updates to UI or game state.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the player's current essence
    balance can lead to undefined behavior or resource depletion. Ensure that all
    calls are validated before execution.
