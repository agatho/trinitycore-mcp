  class: ObjectMgr
  method: LoadReservedPlayersNames
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadReservedPlayersNames()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the list of reserved player names from the database.
  description: The LoadReservedPlayersNames method populates an internal collection
    within the ObjectMgr class with player names that are marked as reserved in the
    game database. These reserved names typically include names that are banned, offensive,
    or otherwise restricted from being used by players. The method is usually invoked
    during server startup or database initialization to ensure that the name validation
    system has access to the latest list of prohibited names. This mechanism helps
    enforce naming policies and prevents players from creating characters with inappropriate
    or conflicting names.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Server Initialization Usage
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadReservedPlayersNames();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup and should not be invoked
    repeatedly during runtime unless the reserved names database has been updated.
    The method relies on the database being properly connected and accessible before
    execution.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid database connection may result in
    an empty or incomplete list of reserved names, potentially allowing invalid names
    to be used. Ensure that all database connections are established prior to calling
    this method.
