  class: Object
  method: BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer
  signature: void Object::BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer(UpdateData * data, Player
    * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates an UpdateData object with create update packets for the specified
    player target.
  description: The BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer method constructs and fills an
    UpdateData structure with the necessary create update packets that inform a specific
    Player about the presence of this Object in the game world. This method is typically
    invoked during the process of sending initial object state to players, such as
    when a player enters a zone or when objects are spawned. It ensures that the target
    player receives all relevant creation data for the object, including its type,
    position, and other properties needed for proper rendering and interaction within
    the game client. The method operates on the const instance and modifies the provided
    UpdateData object in-place.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an UpdateData object that will be populated with create
      update packets for this object.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the create update packets are
      being generated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Object Spawning
    code: 'Object* obj = new GameObject();

      UpdateData data;

      Player* player = ...; // Get a valid player reference

      obj->BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer(&data, player);

      player->GetSession()->SendUpdateData(&data);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Player Zone Entry
    code: "void HandlePlayerEnterZone(Player* player)\n{\n    UpdateData updateData;\n\
      \    // Iterate through objects in the zone\n    for (auto& obj : zoneObjects)\n\
      \    {\n        if (obj->IsVisibleTo(player))\n        {\n            obj->BuildCreateUpdateBlockForPlayer(&updateData,\
      \ player);\n        }\n    }\n    player->GetSession()->SendUpdateData(&updateData);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core update system in TrinityCore and should only
    be called when an object needs to be made visible to a specific player. It does
    not perform any visibility checks itself; it's expected that callers verify visibility
    before invoking this method. The UpdateData object must be properly initialized
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the UpdateData object
    or with invalid Player pointers can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure
    that the target player is valid and connected before using this method.
