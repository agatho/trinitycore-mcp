  class: PathPropertyEntry
  method: GetPropertyIndex
  signature: PathPropertyIndex PathPropertyEntry::GetPropertyIndex() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the property index associated with this path property entry.
  description: The GetPropertyIndex method returns the unique identifier that represents
    the index of a specific path property within the game's navigation system. This
    index is used internally by TrinityCore to reference and manage different types
    of path properties, such as those defining movement restrictions, node connections,
    or traversal costs. The returned PathPropertyIndex value is typically used in
    conjunction with other navigation-related APIs to determine how units can traverse
    specific areas of the world. This method does not perform any validation or modification;
    it simply retrieves the pre-assigned index value stored within the PathPropertyEntry
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PathPropertyIndex value representing the unique identifier for this path
    property entry. The exact numeric value depends on the game's internal configuration
    and defines the semantic meaning of the property in the navigation mesh.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathPropertyEntry* entry = sNavMesh->GetPathPropertyEntry(12345);

      PathPropertyIndex index = entry->GetPropertyIndex();

      printf("Property index: %u\n", index);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and should be used in performance-critical
    sections with care. The PathPropertyIndex returned is typically used as a lookup
    key in internal hash tables or arrays within the navigation mesh system. Ensure
    that the PathPropertyEntry object is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid PathPropertyEntry instance
    will result in undefined behavior. Always verify that the entry has been properly
    constructed and loaded before accessing its property index.
