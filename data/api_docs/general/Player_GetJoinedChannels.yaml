  method: GetJoinedChannels
  signature: const JoinedChannelsList & Player::GetJoinedChannels() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the list of channels that the player has joined.
  description: This method retrieves the collection of channels that a player has
    joined, which is typically used for managing or displaying channel information
    in the game. It provides access to the player's active channel subscriptions,
    allowing developers to query or manipulate channel-related data. The returned
    list contains all currently joined channels, including those from guild, raid,
    party, and other group types. This method is commonly used in conjunction with
    channel management functions for handling communication within World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a constant reference to the JoinedChannelsList which contains all
    the channels that the player has joined. The list includes channel names and their
    associated data, such as the channel type and membership status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void ExampleFunction(Player* player)\n{\n    const JoinedChannelsList&\
      \ channels = player->GetJoinedChannels();\n    for (auto it = channels.begin();\
      \ it != channels.end(); ++it)\n    {\n        // Process each joined channel\n\
      \        std::cout << \"Channel: \" << (*it).first << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be safely called from any thread. The
    returned reference points to internal data structures which should not be modified
    directly, as doing so may cause inconsistencies in channel management.
  warnings: Modifying the returned list directly could lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes. Always use const references when accessing this data to avoid potential
    issues.
