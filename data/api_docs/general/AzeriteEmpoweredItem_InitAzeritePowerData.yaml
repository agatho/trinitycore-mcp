  method: InitAzeritePowerData
  signature: void AzeriteEmpoweredItem::InitAzeritePowerData()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the Azerite power data for the item, setting up internal structures
    for Azerite empowerment effects.
  description: The InitAzeritePowerData method prepares and initializes the internal
    data structures required for managing Azerite powers on an item. This includes
    loading or creating the necessary Azerite power information, setting default values,
    and ensuring that the item is ready to support Azerite empowerment mechanics.
    The method is typically called during item creation or loading processes to ensure
    proper initialization of Azerite-related data. It does not perform any validation
    or checks on existing data, so it should only be called when the item's Azerite
    power data is either uninitialized or needs to be reset.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = new AzeriteEmpoweredItem();

      item->InitAzeritePowerData();

      // Item is now initialized with default Azerite power data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Item Loading Context
    code: "void LoadItemFromDB(Item* item)\n{\n    // ... other loading logic ...\n\
      \    if (item->IsAzeriteEmpowered())\n    {\n        AzeriteEmpoweredItem* azeriteItem\
      \ = reinterpret_cast<AzeriteEmpoweredItem*>(item);\n        azeriteItem->InitAzeritePowerData();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during item creation or loading. Developers should not call this method directly
    unless they are implementing custom item handling logic. The initialization process
    may involve memory allocation for Azerite power data structures and setting default
    values for power levels, ranks, and other empowerment-related properties.
  warnings: Calling InitAzeritePowerData on an item that already has initialized Azerite
    power data can result in data loss or corruption. Always ensure the item's Azerite
    data is in a clean state before calling this method. This method should not be
    called from within performance-critical code paths without prior testing.
