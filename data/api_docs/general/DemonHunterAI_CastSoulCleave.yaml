  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: CastSoulCleave
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::CastSoulCleave(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Soul Cleave ability cast for the Demon Hunter AI.
  description: The CastSoulCleave method triggers the Demon Hunter's Soul Cleave spell
    execution within the AI system. This ability typically deals damage to multiple
    nearby enemies in a cleave pattern. The method handles the casting logic, including
    checking for valid targets, ensuring the spell is not on cooldown, and managing
    the AI's behavior during the cast sequence. It is designed to be called as part
    of the Demon Hunter's combat routine and integrates with the core TrinityCore
    AI framework for proper spell execution and targeting.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier for the
      Soul Cleave spell. This parameter specifies which enemy unit will be targeted
      by the ability.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastSoulCleave
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      ai->CastSoulCleave(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the Demon Hunter AI has already validated that the
    Soul Cleave spell is available for casting. It does not perform cooldown checks
    or target validation internally, relying on the calling code to ensure proper
    conditions are met before invocation.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the Demon Hunter AI is in combat
    and has a valid target. Invoking it without proper context may result in undefined
    behavior or failed spell casting.
