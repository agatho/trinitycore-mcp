  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: GetObjectiveState
  signature: ObjectiveState ObjectiveTracker::GetObjectiveState(Player * bot, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current state of a specific objective within a quest for a
    player.
  description: The GetObjectiveState method retrieves the current progress state of
    a specified objective within a given quest for a particular player. This method
    is used to determine whether an objective has been completed, is in progress,
    or is not yet started. It plays a crucial role in quest tracking and UI updates,
    allowing the game to accurately reflect the player's progress on objectives such
    as killing mobs, collecting items, or reaching specific locations. The returned
    ObjectiveState enum provides detailed information about the objective's status
    which can be used for various game mechanics including quest completion checks,
    reward distribution, and user interface updates.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      objectives are being checked. This parameter must not be null and should point
      to a valid player instance.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest containing the objective being queried.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game's database.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Zero-based index of the specific objective within the quest. This
      index should be less than the total number of objectives defined for the quest.
  returns: 'Returns an ObjectiveState enum value indicating the current state of the
    specified quest objective. Possible values include: OBJECTIVE_STATE_INCOMPLETE,
    OBJECTIVE_STATE_COMPLETE, or OBJECTIVE_STATE_NOT_STARTED. The exact enum values
    may vary based on the TrinityCore implementation.'
  examples:
  - title: Check objective progress for a player
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nuint32 questId = 12345;\n\
      uint32 objectiveIndex = 0;\nObjectiveState state = sObjectiveTracker->GetObjectiveState(player,\
      \ questId, objectiveIndex);\nif (state == OBJECTIVE_STATE_COMPLETE)\n{\n   \
      \ // Handle completed objective\n    player->SendNotification(\"Objective completed!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update UI based on objective state
    code: "void UpdateQuestObjectiveUI(Player* player, uint32 questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)\n\
      {\n    ObjectiveState state = sObjectiveTracker->GetObjectiveState(player, questId,\
      \ objectiveIndex);\n    switch (state)\n    {\n        case OBJECTIVE_STATE_INCOMPLETE:\n\
      \            // Show incomplete progress\n            break;\n        case OBJECTIVE_STATE_COMPLETE:\n\
      \            // Show completed status\n            break;\n        case OBJECTIVE_STATE_NOT_STARTED:\n\
      \            // Show not started\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest tracking system and may cache results
    for performance. The objective index is zero-based and corresponds to the order
    defined in the quest's database entry. Ensure that the player object is valid
    and the quest exists before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (null player pointer, invalid
    quest ID, or out-of-bounds objective index) may result in undefined behavior or
    crashes. Always validate inputs before calling this method. The returned ObjectiveState
    value should not be modified directly as it's managed by the internal tracking
    system.
