  class: Aura
  method: GetApplicationVector
  signature: void Aura::GetApplicationVector(int & applications) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the application vector of the aura and stores it in the provided
    integer reference.
  description: The GetApplicationVector method retrieves the internal application
    vector data from an Aura object and assigns it to the provided integer reference.
    This method is typically used to access the current state or count of aura applications
    on a target. The application vector represents how many times the aura has been
    applied to a unit, which can be important for tracking debuffs, buffs, or other
    effects that stack. The method does not modify the aura itself but rather provides
    read-only access to its internal application data structure.
  parameters:
  - name: applications
    description: Reference to an integer where the application vector value will be
      stored. This parameter is modified by the method to contain the current number
      of aura applications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Aura Application Count
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    int applicationCount;\n\
      \    aura->GetApplicationVector(applicationCount);\n    // applicationCount\
      \ now contains the number of times this aura has been applied\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in combat and effect tracking systems to determine
    how many times a specific aura has been applied to a unit. The implementation
    likely accesses internal counters or lists that track application instances, which
    may be updated during combat events or spell casts.
  warnings: Ensure the Aura pointer is valid before calling this method, as dereferencing
    a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. The applications parameter should
    be initialized before passing to avoid unexpected values.
