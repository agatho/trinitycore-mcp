documentation:
  brief: Checks if the rogue has an active Rupture effect on the specified target.
  description: The HasRupture method determines whether the current subtlety rogue
    player has an active Rupture ability applied to a given target. This method is
    typically used in combat logic to verify if a damage-over-time effect is currently
    active on an enemy, which can influence decision-making for spell selection or
    resource management. The method does not modify any state but returns a boolean
    value indicating the presence of the effect. It's important to note that this
    check may involve verifying the target's aura state and the duration of the Rupture
    effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the rogue has an active Rupture effect on the specified
    target, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (rogue->HasRupture(target)) {\n    // Rupture is active, do not reapply\n\
      \    return;\n}\n// Apply Rupture since it's not active"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the aura system and target debuff tracking
    within TrinityCore. It may perform checks against the target's current auras to
    determine if Rupture is present, including verifying that the effect is not expired
    or dispelled.
