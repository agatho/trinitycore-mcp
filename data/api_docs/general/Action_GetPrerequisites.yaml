documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the prerequisites required for an action to be executed.
  description: The GetPrerequisites method returns a constant reference to an integer
    representing the prerequisite requirements for executing a specific action within
    the TrinityCore framework. This value typically corresponds to a bitmask or identifier
    that defines what conditions, quests, skills, or other in-game criteria must be
    met before the action can be performed. The returned value is read-only and should
    not be modified directly. This method is commonly used in action-based systems
    such as spell casting, quest progression, or ability unlocking mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer that represents the prerequisites required
    for the action. This value usually encodes information about quest requirements,
    skill levels, item possession, or other conditional criteria needed to perform
    the action.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Action Prerequisites
    code: "Action* myAction = sObjectMgr->GetAction(12345);\nif (myAction)\n{\n  \
      \  const int& prerequisites = myAction->GetPrerequisites();\n    if (prerequisites\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        // Action has prerequisites that must be satisfied\n\
      \        // Check if player meets these requirements\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned integer value is typically interpreted as a bitmask or an identifier
    that maps to specific prerequisite conditions in the game's database. Developers
    should ensure they understand how this value is encoded and decoded within the
    context of their specific use case. The method does not perform any validation
    or checks itself; it simply returns the stored prerequisite value.
  warnings: Be cautious when interpreting the returned integer as it may represent
    a complex bitmask or ID mapping. Incorrectly handling this value can lead to actions
    being incorrectly enabled or disabled. Ensure that all prerequisite checking logic
    properly validates against the expected format of the returned value.
