documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified number of vengeance soul fragments from the player's
    inventory
  description: The ConsumeFragments method attempts to remove a given quantity of
    vengeance soul fragments from the player's possession. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with abilities or spells that require sacrificing soul fragments
    as a resource cost. The operation will succeed only if the player has sufficient
    fragments available. If the requested count exceeds the available fragments, the
    method returns false without consuming any fragments. This functionality supports
    game mechanics where players must manage and expend specific resources to perform
    powerful actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified number of fragments were successfully consumed,
    false otherwise. A return value of false indicates either insufficient fragments
    or an error condition during the consumption process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (vengeanceSoulFragmentManager.ConsumeFragments(5)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ consumed 5 fragments\n    // Proceed with ability activation\n} else {\n \
      \   // Not enough fragments available\n    // Notify player or handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Management Check
    code: "uint32 requiredFragments = 10;\nif (vengeanceSoulFragmentManager.ConsumeFragments(requiredFragments))\
      \ {\n    // Execute spell or ability that requires fragments\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_VENGEANCE_ABILITY, true);\n} else {\n    // Inform player they don't\
      \ have enough fragments\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough vengeance\
      \ soul fragments.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the VengeanceSoulFragmentManager instance is properly
    initialized and associated with a valid player context. The actual fragment count
    management should be handled by the underlying inventory system or resource tracking
    mechanism. Consider thread safety if this method is called from multiple contexts
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking available fragments first may lead
    to unexpected behavior if insufficient resources exist. Always verify fragment
    availability before calling to avoid partial consumption scenarios.
