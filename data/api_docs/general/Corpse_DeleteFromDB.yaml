  class: Corpse

  signature: void Corpse::DeleteFromDB(const int & ownerGuid, int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a corpse entry from the database associated with a specific player
    GUID.
  description: The DeleteFromDB method removes a corpse record from the database that
    is linked to a particular player's GUID. This function is typically invoked when
    a player's corpse expires or is looted, ensuring that the corresponding database
    entry is cleaned up to prevent orphaned records. The method operates on the database
    level and does not affect in-memory representations directly. It requires the
    owner's GUID to identify which corpse record should be deleted and optionally
    accepts a transaction parameter for database consistency.
  parameters:
  - name: ownerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose corpse is to be
      deleted from the database. This value must correspond to an existing player
      in the database.
  - name: trans
    description: An optional transaction identifier used for grouping database operations.
      If provided, the deletion will be part of a larger transaction; otherwise, it
      may execute independently.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...;

      uint32 ownerGuid = corpse->GetOwnerGUID();

      corpse->DeleteFromDB(ownerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: With Transaction Support
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...;

      uint32 ownerGuid = corpse->GetOwnerGUID();

      int transactionId = 12345;

      corpse->DeleteFromDB(ownerGuid, transactionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct database operation and should only be called
    when it's certain that the corpse record exists in the database. It does not validate
    whether the GUID corresponds to an actual player or if the corpse has already
    been removed.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying the existence of the associated
    corpse record may result in unnecessary database queries or errors. Additionally,
    ensure proper synchronization when using transactions to avoid race conditions.
