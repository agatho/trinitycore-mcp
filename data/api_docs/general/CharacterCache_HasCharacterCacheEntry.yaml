  method: HasCharacterCacheEntry
  signature: bool CharacterCache::HasCharacterCacheEntry(const int & guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a character cache entry exists for the specified GUID.
  description: The HasCharacterCacheEntry method determines whether a cached character
    entry is present in the CharacterCache for a given global unique identifier (GUID).
    This method is typically used to verify the existence of character data before
    attempting to access or retrieve it from the cache. The cache stores character
    information to avoid repeated database queries, improving performance during player
    interactions such as login, logout, and character-related operations. This check
    ensures that subsequent cache access operations are valid and prevents potential
    errors when accessing non-existent entries.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the character to check for
      in the cache. This value represents the unique identifier assigned to each character
      in the World of Warcraft database.
  returns: Returns true if a character cache entry exists for the specified GUID;
    otherwise, returns false. A return value of false indicates that either no character
    with the given GUID exists or the entry has not yet been cached.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (CharacterCache::Instance()->HasCharacterCacheEntry(12345)) {\n    //\
      \ Character data is cached, safe to access\n    // ... perform cache-based operations\n\
      } else {\n    // Character not in cache, may need to load from database\n  \
      \  // ... handle uncached character\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Character Loading Logic
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = 54321;\nif (!sCharacterCache->HasCharacterCacheEntry(playerGuid))\
      \ {\n    // Load character from database and populate cache\n    CharacterCacheEntry*\
      \ entry = new CharacterCacheEntry();\n    // ... populate entry with data from\
      \ DB\n    sCharacterCache->AddCharacterCacheEntry(playerGuid, entry);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Use existing cached data\n    CharacterCacheEntry* entry = sCharacterCache->GetCharacterCacheEntry(playerGuid);\n\
      \    // ... process cached character data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a fast lookup in an internal cache structure, typically
    implemented as a hash map or similar data structure for O(1) average-case performance.
    The cache is managed by the TrinityCore server and automatically populated when
    character data is first accessed. Developers should be aware that cached entries
    may be evicted due to memory pressure or cache expiration policies.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method for critical game logic, as cache
    consistency can be affected by concurrent access or cache invalidation events.
    Always validate the existence of cached data before attempting to retrieve it,
    especially in multi-threaded environments where cache state might change between
    checks and actual access.
