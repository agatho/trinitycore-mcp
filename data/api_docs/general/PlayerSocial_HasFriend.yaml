  class: PlayerSocial
  method: HasFriend
  signature: bool PlayerSocial::HasFriend(const int & friendGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player has another player as a friend in their social list.
  description: The HasFriend method determines if a specified player GUID exists in
    the current player's friend list. This method is used internally by the TrinityCore
    server to validate social relationships and ensure that friendship permissions
    are correctly enforced. The method performs a lookup within the player's social
    data structure to verify the existence of the given friend GUID. It does not perform
    any database operations directly but relies on cached social information loaded
    for the player session.
  parameters:
  - name: friendGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check for in
      the friend list. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from player objects
      or database queries.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player GUID is found in the current player's
    friend list, false otherwise. The method will return false if the friendGuid parameter
    is invalid or if no social data has been loaded for the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player is in friends list
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player object\nuint32 friendGUID = 12345;\n\
      if (player->GetSocial()->HasFriend(friendGUID))\n{\n    // Player is in friends\
      \ list\n    sLog->outString(\"Player %u is a friend.\", friendGUID);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Player is not in friends list\n    sLog->outString(\"Player %u is\
      \ not a friend.\", friendGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on cached social data and may not reflect real-time
    changes if the social list has been modified without reloading. The implementation
    uses efficient lookup mechanisms, typically O(1) or O(log n) depending on internal
    data structure used (likely a set or map). This method should only be called on
    players who have loaded their social data.
  warnings: Do not use this method with invalid GUID values as it may cause undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the player object has valid social data before calling this
    method. The method does not perform any validation of the friendGuid parameter
    beyond basic existence checks.
