  signature: const SpellEffectInfo & AuraScript::GetEffectInfo(int effIndex) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the SpellEffectInfo structure for a specified effect index within
    the aura.
  description: The GetEffectInfo method provides access to detailed information about
    a specific spell effect associated with an aura. This method is typically used
    within AuraScript implementations to query properties such as effect radius, base
    points, or target types. The returned SpellEffectInfo object contains immutable
    data that describes how the effect behaves in the context of the aura it belongs
    to. It's important to note that this method should only be called during valid
    aura script execution contexts where the effect index is known to be valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the SpellEffectInfo structure corresponding to
    the specified effect index within the aura. This structure holds read-only information
    about the spell effect, including its type, base points, radius, and other relevant
    parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Effect Information in AuraScript
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnApply(AuraEffect\
      \ const* eff, AuraEffectHandleModes mode) override\n    {\n        const SpellEffectInfo&\
      \ effectInfo = GetEffectInfo(0);\n        // Use effectInfo to access properties\
      \ like Radius, BasePoints, etc.\n        if (effectInfo.Effect == SPELL_EFFECT_SCHOOL_DAMAGE)\n\
      \        {\n            // Handle damage effect specifically\n        }\n  \
      \  }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AuraScript is properly initialized and that
    the effect index passed to it corresponds to a valid effect within the aura's
    spell definition. The returned SpellEffectInfo reference is guaranteed to be valid
    only during the execution of the AuraScript method where this call occurs.
  warnings: Do not use this method outside of valid AuraScript execution contexts,
    as it may result in undefined behavior or access violations. Also, avoid modifying
    the returned SpellEffectInfo object as it's const and represents immutable data
    from the spell definition.
