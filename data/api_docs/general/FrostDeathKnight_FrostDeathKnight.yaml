  class: FrostDeathKnight
  method: FrostDeathKnight
  signature: void FrostDeathKnight::FrostDeathKnight(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Frost Death Knight AI bot with the specified player reference.
  description: The FrostDeathKnight constructor initializes a Death Knight AI bot
    specifically configured for frost specialization. This method sets up internal
    state and configuration based on the provided player instance, preparing the bot
    for AI-controlled gameplay. The initialization includes setting up spell caches,
    movement behaviors, and combat strategies specific to frost death knights. It
    is typically called during the creation or activation of an AI-controlled Death
    Knight character in TrinityCore environments.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the Frost Death Knight
      AI bot to be initialized. Must not be null and should represent a valid player
      with Death Knight class and frost specialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Frost Death Knight Bot
    code: 'Player* frostDK = new Player();

      // ... initialize player with Death Knight class and frost spec ...

      FrostDeathKnight frostDKBot(frostDK);

      // Bot is now initialized and ready for AI control'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs initialization of AI-specific variables
    such as spell cooldown tracking, target selection logic, and frost-specific ability
    usage patterns. The method assumes the player parameter has already been validated
    and properly configured with Death Knight class data.
