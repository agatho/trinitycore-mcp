documentation:
  brief: Processes and applies defensive cooldowns for the Windwalker Monk class.
  description: The HandleDefensiveCooldowns method manages the application and execution
    of defensive abilities and cooldowns specific to the Windwalker Monk class in
    TrinityCore. This method evaluates the current state of the monk's defensive resources,
    such as cooldown timers, mana levels, and combat conditions, to determine when
    and how defensive abilities should be activated. It ensures that defensive cooldowns
    are used optimally based on threat levels, incoming damage, and the monk's overall
    combat strategy. The method integrates with the core AI system to maintain proper
    timing and resource management during encounters.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_isWindwalkerMonk)\n    {\n        m_windwalkerMonk->HandleDefensiveCooldowns();\n\
      \    }\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure proper
    cooldown management. It relies on internal state tracking of the monk's defensive
    abilities and may interact with other AI components for optimal timing decisions.
