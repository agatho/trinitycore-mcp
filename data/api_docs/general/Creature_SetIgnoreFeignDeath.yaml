  class: Creature
  method: SetIgnoreFeignDeath
  signature: void Creature::SetIgnoreFeignDeath(bool ignoreFeignDeath)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature ignores feign death effects.
  description: This method controls whether a creature will ignore the feign death
    effect, which is typically used to prevent creatures from being killed by a player's
    feign death ability. When set to true, the creature will not be affected by feign
    death and will continue to remain alive even if the feign death is triggered.
    This is commonly used for boss creatures or special NPCs that should not be susceptible
    to feign death mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: ignoreFeignDeath
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the creature should ignore feign
      death effects. True means the creature will ignore feign death, false means
      it will be affected by feign death.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a boss to ignore feign death
    code: 'Creature* boss = GetCreature();

      boss->SetIgnoreFeignDeath(true);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling feign death for a regular creature
    code: 'Creature* npc = GetCreature();

      npc->SetIgnoreFeignDeath(false);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature AI methods
    to control how creatures respond to player actions. It should be used carefully
    as it may affect game balance and encounter difficulty.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unbalanced encounters or unexpected
    behavior in combat, particularly when dealing with boss creatures that should
    normally be susceptible to feign death.
