api:
  class: LootDistribution
  method: BalanceLootDistribution
  signature: void LootDistribution::BalanceLootDistribution(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Balances loot distribution among group members based on their contribution
    and role.
  description: The BalanceLootDistribution method adjusts the loot distribution process
    within a group to ensure fair allocation of items. It considers factors such as
    player participation, loot roll outcomes, and group composition to optimize distribution
    fairness. This method is typically invoked during group loot events where multiple
    players are eligible for item drops. The implementation may modify internal loot
    state variables and trigger updates to client UI elements to reflect adjusted
    distribution results.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Group Loot Context
    code: "void HandleGroupLoot(Group* group)\n{\n    LootDistribution lootDist;\n\
      \    lootDist.BalanceLootDistribution(group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal loot tracking systems and may
    require the group to be in a valid state for distribution. It's designed to work
    alongside other loot-related APIs within TrinityCore's framework.
  warnings: Calling this method without a properly initialized group may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all group members are valid before invoking this
    function.
