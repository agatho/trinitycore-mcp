  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: ShouldFollowGroup
  signature: bool EnhancedBotAI::ShouldFollowGroup()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the enhanced bot should follow the player's group.
  description: The ShouldFollowGroup method evaluates the current state of the enhanced
    bot to determine if it should follow the player's group. This decision is based
    on various factors such as the bot's current behavior mode, group status, and
    configuration settings. The method returns true when the bot is in a state where
    following the group is appropriate, and false otherwise. This functionality is
    crucial for bots that need to maintain proximity to their group members during
    instance encounters or group activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the enhanced bot should follow the player's group; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (botAI->ShouldFollowGroup()) {\n    botAI->SetBehavior(BotBehavior::FOLLOW_GROUP);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group management system
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::UpdateGroupFollowing() {\n    if (ShouldFollowGroup())\
      \ {\n        if (!IsFollowingGroup()) {\n            StartFollowingGroup();\n\
      \        }\n    } else {\n        if (IsFollowingGroup()) {\n            StopFollowingGroup();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's AI update cycle to make
    dynamic decisions about group following behavior. The implementation may consider
    factors such as the bot's role in the group, current combat status, and player
    proximity.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot's group state is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as an uninitialized or invalid group reference could lead to unexpected
    behavior.
