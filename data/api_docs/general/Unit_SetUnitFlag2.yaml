documentation:
  brief: Sets the unit flags2 for a Unit object, enabling specific game mechanics
    behaviors.
  description: The SetUnitFlag2 method is used to assign or modify the UnitFlags2
    value for a Unit object. This flag controls various gameplay-related attributes
    such as movement types, combat states, and visibility settings. It's commonly
    used in conjunction with other unit manipulation methods to ensure proper behavior
    during combat, movement, or interaction with players. The method typically affects
    how the unit behaves within the game world, particularly regarding its state and
    interactions with other entities.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The UnitFlags2 value to set for the unit. This parameter defines
      specific behaviors and states of the unit, including movement type, combat status,
      and visibility settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      target->SetUnitFlag2(UnitFlags2::UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit();

      player->SetUnitFlag2(UnitFlags2::UNIT_FLAG_IN_COMBAT | UnitFlags2::UNIT_FLAG_UNK1);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other unit-related methods
    to ensure proper behavior during combat or movement. It's important to understand
    that modifying flags can affect how the unit interacts with players and other
    entities in the game world, especially regarding visibility and combat states.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in combat
    or movement, particularly if flags are set incorrectly or without proper understanding
    of their effects. Care should be taken when setting flags that affect combat state
    or visibility.
