api:
  class: AuctionHouseBot
  method: SetItemsRatio
  signature: void AuctionHouseBot::SetItemsRatio(uint32 al, uint32 ho, uint32 ne)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the ratio of items for alliance, horde, and neutral factions in the
    auction house bot configuration.
  description: The SetItemsRatio method configures the distribution ratios for item
    listings across different faction categories within the AuctionHouseBot system.
    This method allows administrators or developers to control how many items are
    listed for each faction (Alliance, Horde, and Neutral) when the bot is managing
    auctions. The parameters represent the relative weights or percentages used in
    determining item distribution. This functionality is crucial for maintaining balanced
    auction house operations and ensuring fair representation of items across different
    player factions in World of Warcraft servers running TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: al
    description: Ratio value for Alliance items. Determines the relative weight or
      percentage of Alliance faction items in the auction house bot's listings.
  - name: ho
    description: Ratio value for Horde items. Determines the relative weight or percentage
      of Horde faction items in the auction house bot's listings.
  - name: ne
    description: Ratio value for Neutral items. Determines the relative weight or
      percentage of Neutral faction items in the auction house bot's listings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Balanced Faction Ratios
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot* ahbot = sAuctionHouseBot;

      ahbot->SetItemsRatio(30, 30, 40); // 30% Alliance, 30% Horde, 40% Neutral items'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Dominant Faction Listings
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot* ahbot = sAuctionHouseBot;

      ahbot->SetItemsRatio(50, 25, 25); // 50% Alliance, 25% Horde, 25% Neutral items'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal configuration of the AuctionHouseBot
    and should be called before the bot begins its auction management operations.
    The ratio values are typically interpreted as relative weights rather than absolute
    percentages, meaning that the actual distribution depends on the total number
    of items being managed by the bot.
  warnings: Incorrect ratio values may lead to imbalanced auction house listings.
    Ensure that all parameters are positive integers and that their combined values
    provide a reasonable distribution across factions to maintain game balance and
    player satisfaction.
