  class: Battleground
  method: RemovePlayer
  signature: void Battleground::RemovePlayer(Player * param0, int param1, int param2)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the battleground, handling cleanup and state updates.
  description: The RemovePlayer method removes a specified player from the battleground
    instance. It performs necessary cleanup operations such as updating player states,
    removing them from internal tracking structures, and ensuring proper synchronization
    with the game world. This method is typically invoked when a player leaves a battleground
    either voluntarily, due to disconnecting, or through forced removal. The method
    handles the transition of the player back to normal gameplay state while maintaining
    the integrity of the battleground's internal data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object that needs to be removed from the battleground.
  - name: param1
    description: Integer parameter representing the player's team ID (typically 0
      for Alliance, 1 for Horde).
  - name: param2
    description: Integer parameter that may represent the removal reason or state
      flag (e.g., 0 for normal leave, 1 for disconnect, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Removal
    code: "Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(player);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->RemovePlayer(player, player->GetTeamId(), 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Player Due to Disconnect
    code: "Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(player);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->RemovePlayer(player, player->GetTeamId(), 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the battleground context. It
    is not thread-safe and must be executed on the correct game thread. The method
    internally calls cleanup functions that may trigger additional events or updates
    in the game world.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can result in inconsistent player state, ghost
    players in the battleground, or potential crashes if not properly synchronized
    with the game loop. Always ensure the player pointer is valid before calling this
    method.
