  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetAverageUpdateTime
  signature: uint32 CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetAverageUpdateTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average update time in milliseconds for combat
    behavior processing.
  description: The GetAverageUpdateTime method computes the average time taken to
    process combat behaviors during each update cycle. This metric is crucial for
    performance monitoring and optimization of AI-driven combat systems within TrinityCore.
    The value represents the mean duration in milliseconds across multiple update
    intervals, helping developers identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies
    in combat behavior execution. This method typically aggregates timing data from
    recent updates and returns a smoothed average to provide a more stable performance
    indicator.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the average time in milliseconds spent
    processing combat behaviors during each update cycle. Higher values may indicate
    performance issues or complex AI logic requiring optimization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Performance Monitoring
    code: "CombatBehaviorIntegration* combatAI = player->GetCombatBehavior();\nuint32\
      \ avgTime = combatAI->GetAverageUpdateTime();\nif (avgTime > 50)\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_AI,\
      \ \"High combat AI update time detected: %u ms\", avgTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely maintains internal timing statistics that are updated
    during each combat behavior update cycle. The returned value may be cached or
    averaged over a specific number of samples to provide more stable performance
    metrics. Developers should consider that this metric includes all combat behavior
    processing overhead, including decision-making, pathfinding, and action execution.
  warnings: The method may return inaccurate values if called before sufficient update
    cycles have occurred to establish a meaningful average. Additionally, in high-frequency
    combat scenarios, the timing data might fluctuate significantly, making individual
    readings less reliable for performance analysis.
