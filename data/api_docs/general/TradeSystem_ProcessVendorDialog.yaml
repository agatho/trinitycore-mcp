  signature: void TradeSystem::ProcessVendorDialog(Player * player, const VendorInfo
    & vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the processing of a vendor dialog interaction for a player.
  description: The ProcessVendorDialog method manages the logic when a player interacts
    with a vendor NPC to open their trading interface. This includes validating the
    player's state, checking if the vendor is valid, and preparing the appropriate
    vendor item list for display. The method ensures that only valid players can access
    vendor services and handles necessary game state updates during the interaction.
    It typically triggers UI elements to show available items, prices, and purchase
    options.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the interacting player.
      Must be a valid player instance with an active session.
  - name: vendor
    description: Reference to the VendorInfo structure containing vendor-specific
      data and item listings. Should represent a valid NPC vendor with available items
      for sale.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Dialog Processing
    code: "void HandleVendorInteraction(Player* player, const VendorInfo& vendorInfo)\n\
      {\n    TradeSystem::ProcessVendorDialog(player, vendorInfo);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Vendor Dialog with Precondition Check
    code: "void SafeVendorInteraction(Player* player, const VendorInfo& vendorInfo)\n\
      {\n    if (player && player->IsInWorld() && vendorInfo.m_items.size() > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        TradeSystem::ProcessVendorDialog(player, vendorInfo);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player has already been validated and that the vendor
    data is properly initialized. It may internally call other subsystems like the
    player's inventory manager or UI system to display vendor items.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and vendor parameters are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid pointers can cause crashes or undefined behavior. The
    method does not perform any authentication checks on the vendor itself beyond
    basic validity.
