documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MountManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~MountManager destructor is automatically invoked when a MountManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal data structures, memory allocations, and references related
    to mount management within the TrinityCore server environment. The destructor
    typically handles releasing dynamically allocated memory, unregistering event
    handlers, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain in the system. It's an essential
    part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern used throughout
    the TrinityCore codebase for managing game object lifecycles.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of MountManager instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    MountManager manager; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use manager ...\n} // Destructor ~MountManager() automatically called\
      \ here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of MountManager pointer
    code: 'MountManager* manager = new MountManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // ~MountManager() destructor called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects go out
    of scope. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The MountManager class likely manages a collection
    of player mounts and their associated data, so proper destruction ensures no memory
    leaks occur during server shutdown or object cleanup.
