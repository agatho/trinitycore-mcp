  class: Unit
  method: SetMoveCantSwim
  signature: bool Unit::SetMoveCantSwim(bool cantSwim)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the unit can swim or not, returning true if the operation was
    successful.
  description: The SetMoveCantSwim method controls a unit's ability to swim by setting
    a flag that prevents swimming behavior. This method is typically used in game
    mechanics to restrict movement capabilities for units that should not be able
    to swim, such as creatures or players with specific conditions. The method returns
    true if the operation succeeds and false otherwise, indicating whether the flag
    was properly set. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper movement
    restrictions in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the operation was successful in setting the swim flag,
    false otherwise. The return value indicates whether the unit's swimming capability
    was correctly modified.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit();\nbool result = unit->SetMoveCantSwim(true);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Swimming is now disabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal movement flags and may require
    synchronization with other movement-related methods. It should be used carefully
    as it affects the unit's ability to perform swimming actions.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect movement behavior for
    units, potentially causing issues in game mechanics or player experience. Care
    should be taken when setting this flag for creatures or players with specific
    swimming requirements.
