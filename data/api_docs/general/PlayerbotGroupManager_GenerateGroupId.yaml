  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: GenerateGroupId
  signature: uint32 PlayerbotGroupManager::GenerateGroupId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique group identifier for player bot groups within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The GenerateGroupId method creates and returns a unique 32-bit unsigned
    integer identifier that represents a player bot group. This identifier is used
    internally by the PlayerbotGroupManager to track and manage different groups of
    player bots. The method ensures uniqueness of group IDs across the server instance,
    preventing conflicts when multiple bot groups are active simultaneously. It typically
    increments an internal counter or utilizes a random generation mechanism to produce
    the next available ID. This method is essential for maintaining proper group management
    in player bot systems and is often called when creating new bot groups.
  parameters: []
  returns: A unique 32-bit unsigned integer representing the newly generated group
    identifier. Each call to this method returns a distinct value, ensuring no two
    active groups share the same ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 groupId = botGroupManager->GenerateGroupId();

      // groupId now contains a unique identifier for a new player bot group'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a New Bot Group with Generated ID
    code: 'PlayerbotGroup* newGroup = new PlayerbotGroup();

      uint32 groupId = botGroupManager->GenerateGroupId();

      newGroup->SetId(groupId);

      botGroupManager->AddGroup(newGroup);

      // The new group now has a unique identifier and is registered in the manager'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a new player bot group needs to be
    created. The generated IDs are guaranteed to be unique within the current server
    session, but may not persist across server restarts. The implementation likely
    uses atomic operations or mutex locking to ensure thread safety when multiple
    threads attempt to generate group IDs simultaneously.
  warnings: Do not assume that group IDs will remain consistent across server restarts.
    If persistent group identification is required, additional storage mechanisms
    should be implemented. Also, excessive calls to this method without proper group
    management may lead to ID exhaustion if the integer range is not properly managed.
