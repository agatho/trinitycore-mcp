documentation:
  brief: Populates the provided GearFactoryStats structure with statistics about bot
    gear generation.
  description: The GetStats method collects and aggregates various statistics related
    to the bot gear generation process within the BotGearFactory class. It fills a
    provided GearFactoryStats object with data such as total items generated, success
    rates, average item levels, and other relevant metrics. This method is typically
    used for monitoring, debugging, or reporting purposes to understand how effectively
    the bot gear factory is operating. The method does not modify any internal state
    of the BotGearFactory instance and is safe to call concurrently.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotGearFactory factory;

      GearFactoryStats stats;

      factory.GetStats(stats);

      std::cout << "Total items generated: " << stats.totalItemsGenerated << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not cause performance
    degradation. It's recommended to call this method periodically for monitoring
    purposes rather than on every gear generation event.
