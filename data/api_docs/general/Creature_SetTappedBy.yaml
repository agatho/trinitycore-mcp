  class: Creature
  method: SetTappedBy
  signature: void Creature::SetTappedBy(const int * unit, bool withGroup)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the creature as tapped by a player or group of players.
  description: This method marks a creature as being tapped by a specified unit, which
    is typically a player or group of players. It is used in the context of World
    of Warcraft's loot system and creature AI to determine whether a creature has
    been successfully tapped for loot purposes. The method ensures that the creature's
    tap status is updated correctly within the game mechanics, allowing for proper
    loot distribution when the creature is killed.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the unit (player or group) that is tapping the creature.
      This parameter must be valid and cannot be nullptr.
  - name: withGroup
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the tap is from a group member. If
      true, the tap is considered as coming from a group; if false, it's from an individual
      player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      Player* player = new Player();

      creature->SetTappedBy(player, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Group tap example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      Group* group = new Group();

      creature->SetTappedBy(group, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be called only when the creature is in a state where it
    can be tapped. It's important to ensure that the unit pointer is valid and not
    null before calling this method. The implementation involves updating internal
    flags related to tap status, which may affect loot distribution logic.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect loot distribution or
    even errors in the game mechanics if the unit pointer is invalid or null. Care
    must be taken when using this method with group members versus individual players.
