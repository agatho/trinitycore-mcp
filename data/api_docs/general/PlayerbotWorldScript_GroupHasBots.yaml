documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a given group contains any player bots.
  description: The GroupHasBots method determines if a specified group in the World
    of Warcraft instance includes any player-controlled bots. This functionality is
    typically used within the TrinityCore player bot system to identify groups that
    contain automated players, which may be relevant for various gameplay mechanics
    such as avoiding bot encounters, managing group composition, or applying specific
    AI behaviors. The method evaluates the group's members and returns true if at
    least one member is a bot controlled by the player bot system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified group contains one or more player bots; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a group has bots before joining
    code: "if (PlayerbotWorldScript::GroupHasBots(playerGroup)) {\n    // Avoid joining\
      \ or warn user\n    sChatHandler->PSendSysMessage(\"This group contains player\
      \ bots.\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed with group actions\n    sChatHandler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      This group is free of bots.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal tracking of bot players within the TrinityCore
    player bot system. It may not detect all forms of automated gameplay if those
    are not implemented as traditional player bots.
