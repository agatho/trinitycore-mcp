documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all spell script handlers from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadSpellScripts method is responsible for loading all registered
    spell scripts from the database into the game's memory. This method iterates through
    the spell script entries stored in the database and registers them with the appropriate
    spell handling systems. It ensures that custom spell behaviors defined by scripters
    are properly initialized and ready to be executed when spells are cast. The method
    typically runs during server startup or when reloading spell data, and it's crucial
    for maintaining the integrity of scripted spell mechanics within TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void World::LoadSpellScripts()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadSpellScripts();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading spell data. It's not thread-safe and must be executed in the main thread
    context. The method relies on database tables containing spell script definitions
    and will silently skip entries that are invalid or malformed.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate script registrations.
    It should never be invoked during active gameplay as it can cause memory leaks
    or inconsistent behavior. Ensure all spell scripts are properly defined in the
    database before calling this method.
