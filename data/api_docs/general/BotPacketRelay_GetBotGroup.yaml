  method: GetBotGroup
  signature: Group * BotPacketRelay::GetBotGroup(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the group instance that a specified bot player belongs to.
  description: The GetBotGroup method is used to obtain the Group object associated
    with a given bot player. This method allows the system to determine which group
    (if any) the bot is currently a member of, enabling proper management of bot behavior
    within group contexts such as raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds. The returned
    Group pointer can be null if the bot is not in a group, or it may point to an
    invalid group if the bot's group membership has become inconsistent due to game
    events or internal state issues. This method is typically used by the bot AI system
    and packet relay mechanisms to ensure proper communication and coordination within
    group environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Group object that the specified bot player belongs to,
    or nullptr if the bot is not currently in a group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if bot is in a group
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is already initialized\nGroup* botGroup\
      \ = botPacketRelay->GetBotGroup(bot);\nif (botGroup != nullptr)\n{\n    // Bot\
      \ is in a group, proceed with group-based logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot %s\
      \ is in group ID %u\", bot->GetName().c_str(), botGroup->GetId());\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Bot is not in any group\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot %s is not in a\
      \ group\", bot->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of bot players and their
    group memberships. It may return nullptr even if a bot was previously in a group,
    especially after group disbands or player logout events. The returned Group pointer
    should be validated before use to prevent null pointer dereferences.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided Player object is a valid bot instance.
    Using this method with a non-bot player may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes
    if the internal data structures are not properly initialized for that player type.
    Additionally, group membership can change dynamically during gameplay, so cached
    results from this method should be refreshed as needed.
