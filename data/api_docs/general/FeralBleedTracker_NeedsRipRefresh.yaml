  signature: bool FeralBleedTracker::NeedsRipRefresh(int guid, uint32 pandemicWindow)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a rip effect needs to be refreshed based on pandemic window
    logic for a given unit.
  description: The NeedsRipRefresh method evaluates if a rip effect applied to a target
    should be refreshed, taking into account the pandemic window mechanics. In World
    of Warcraft's Feral Druid gameplay, the pandemic window allows for extending existing
    bleeds and rips without fully resetting their duration. This method checks whether
    the current rip on the specified unit is within its pandemic window, indicating
    that refreshing it would extend rather than replace the existing effect. The method
    requires a unit GUID to identify the target and a pandemic window value to determine
    the time threshold for refresh eligibility.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit whose rip status
      is being evaluated.
  - name: pandemicWindow
    description: The duration in milliseconds representing the pandemic window threshold
      for determining if a rip can be refreshed.
  returns: Returns true if the rip effect on the specified unit should be refreshed
    based on pandemic window logic, otherwise false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if rip should be refreshed
    code: "if (feralBleedTracker.NeedsRipRefresh(playerGuid, 3000)) {\n    // Refresh\
      \ the rip effect\n    DoRipRefresh();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a combat rotation logic
    code: "void FeralDruidAI::UpdateCombatLogic() {\n    for (auto& target : GetTargets())\
      \ {\n        if (feralBleedTracker.NeedsRipRefresh(target.GetGUID(), 3000))\
      \ {\n            CastRip();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other bleed tracking logic
    to optimize rotation efficiency. The pandemic window value is usually derived
    from the game's internal mechanics and should match the expected duration for
    rip refresh behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed corresponds to a valid unit in the current
    context, as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect evaluation
    results.
