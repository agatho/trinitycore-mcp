  brief: Initiates the startup spawn sequence for game objects and creatures in the
    TrinityCore server.
  description: The BeginStartup method is responsible for triggering the initial spawning
    process of game entities such as creatures, game objects, and other world entities
    during the server's startup phase. This method orchestrates the loading and placement
    of these entities into their respective maps according to predefined spawn points
    and configurations. It ensures that all necessary entities are properly initialized
    before the server becomes available to players. The method typically executes
    during the server initialization sequence and is called once at startup to begin
    the spawning process.

    code: 'StartupSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;

      orchestrator.BeginStartup();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup. It is typically
    invoked by the core server initialization logic and should not be called manually
    in most cases. The actual spawning process may take some time depending on the
    number of entities to spawn.
