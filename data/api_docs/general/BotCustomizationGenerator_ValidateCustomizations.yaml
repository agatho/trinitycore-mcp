  class: BotCustomizationGenerator
  method: ValidateCustomizations
  signature: bool BotCustomizationGenerator::ValidateCustomizations(uint8 race, uint8
    gender, const int & customizations)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the specified bot customizations are valid for the given
    race and gender
  description: The ValidateCustomizations method checks if a set of customizations
    is appropriate for a specific player race and gender in the context of bot creation.
    This validation ensures that bots are created with legitimate appearance options
    that conform to game rules and restrictions. The method typically performs checks
    against valid customization ranges, ensuring that values fall within expected
    bounds for each race-gender combination. It serves as a data integrity check before
    applying customizations to bot characters.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The racial type of the bot (0-10), where 0=Human, 1=Orc, 2=Dwarf,
      etc. Must be a valid race identifier.
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the bot (0=Male, 1=Female). Must be either 0 or 1.
  - name: customizations
    description: Reference to an integer containing the customization data. The value
      represents packed appearance settings for the bot character.
  returns: Returns true if the customizations are valid for the specified race and
    gender, false otherwise. Invalid combinations include out-of-range values or settings
    that don't align with the selected race-gender pair.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation of bot customizations
    code: "uint8 race = 0; // Human\nuint8 gender = 1; // Female\nint customizations\
      \ = 12345;\nbool isValid = BotCustomizationGenerator::ValidateCustomizations(race,\
      \ gender, customizations);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with bot creation\
      \ using these customizations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in bot creation workflow
    code: "class BotManager\n{\npublic:\n    bool CreateBot(uint8 race, uint8 gender,\
      \ int customizations)\n    {\n        if (!BotCustomizationGenerator::ValidateCustomizations(race,\
      \ gender, customizations))\n        {\n            return false; // Invalid\
      \ customization data\n        }\n        // Proceed with bot creation logic\n\
      \        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs bitwise operations or range checks on the customizations
    parameter to verify that all appearance values are within valid ranges for the
    specified race and gender. The implementation may cache valid customization data
    for performance optimization.
  warnings: Do not use invalid customization values as they may cause bot creation
    failures or unexpected behavior in the game client. Always validate before applying
    customizations to ensure compatibility with the selected race and gender.
