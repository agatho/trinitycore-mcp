  brief: Initializes the Warden anti-cheat system for the session
  description: The InitWarden method sets up the Warden anti-cheat system for a WorldSession,
    establishing the necessary cryptographic keys and security protocols to protect
    against cheating in World of Warcraft. This method is typically called during
    the authentication process when a client connects to the server. It prepares the
    session for Warden communication by initializing internal structures and preparing
    the encryption keys needed for secure client-server communication. The method
    ensures that all subsequent Warden checks can be properly executed and that the
    anti-cheat system functions correctly throughout the player's session.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Warden Initialization
    code: "void HandleAuthSession(WorldPacket& recvData)\n{\n    // ... authentication\
      \ logic ...\n    WorldSession* session = new WorldSession(...);\n    // Initialize\
      \ Warden after successful authentication\n    session->InitWarden(42);  // Example\
      \ key value\n    // ... continue with session setup ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's anti-cheat infrastructure and should
    only be called once per session during the authentication phase. The parameter
    'k' represents a cryptographic key used in Warden's encryption scheme, though
    its exact value and generation process are internal to the anti-cheat implementation.
