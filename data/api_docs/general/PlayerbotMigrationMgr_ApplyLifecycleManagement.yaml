  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ApplyLifecycleManagement()
documentation:
  brief: Applies lifecycle management to player bots within the TrinityCore system
  description: The ApplyLifecycleManagement method manages the creation, updating,
    and destruction of player bot instances according to configured rules and game
    state. This method ensures that player bots are properly initialized with appropriate
    AI behavior, character stats, and quest data while maintaining system performance
    and avoiding resource leaks. It typically runs during server startup, configuration
    changes, or when new player bots need to be integrated into the active world.
    The method coordinates with other subsystems to handle bot persistence, faction
    alignment, and interaction with real players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if lifecycle management was successfully applied to all player
    bots, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate configuration errors,
    resource limitations, or failure in initializing individual bot instances.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->ApplyLifecycleManagement()) {\n\
      \    TC_LOG_INFO(\"playerbots\", \"Player bot lifecycle management applied successfully\"\
      );\n} else {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\", \"Failed to apply player bot\
      \ lifecycle management\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or configuration
    reloads. It may block execution while processing bot instances, so it's recommended
    to call it asynchronously in performance-critical scenarios. The method relies
    on proper configuration files and database entries for successful operation.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper cleanup can lead to memory
    leaks or duplicate bot instances. Ensure that any existing player bots are properly
    terminated before invoking this method. This method should not be called from
    within AI update loops as it may cause deadlocks.
