  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleDungeonQuests(Player * bot, uint32 dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles dungeon-related quest completions for a player bot.
  description: The HandleDungeonQuests method is responsible for managing the completion
    of quests associated with dungeon instances for a specified player bot. This function
    typically checks if the player has completed required objectives within a dungeon,
    updates quest status in the database, and may reward the player with experience,
    items, or other in-game benefits. It plays a key role in automating quest progression
    for bots in TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. The method assumes that
    the player is already inside a dungeon instance and has the relevant quest active.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character performing
      the dungeon quest completion.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: Unique identifier for the dungeon instance. Used to determine which
      specific dungeon's quests should be processed and completed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      uint32 dungeonId = 1234;

      questCompletion->HandleDungeonQuests(myBot, dungeonId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to update quest progress and
    may trigger additional events or callbacks related to quest completion. It is
    intended for use in botting systems or automated questing scripts within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method without proper validation of player state
    or dungeon context can lead to incorrect quest progression or server-side inconsistencies.
    Ensure that the player is actually inside a valid dungeon before calling this
    method.
