api:
  class: MonkAI
  method: OptimizeFormForSituation
  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeFormForSituation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the current combat situation and selects the most optimal form
    for the monk AI to assume.
  description: The OptimizeFormForSituation method is responsible for determining
    the best form for a monk AI character based on the current tactical environment.
    This includes analyzing factors such as target proximity, threat level, available
    abilities, and player class mechanics specific to the Monk class in World of Warcraft.
    The method modifies the internal state of the AI to reflect the chosen form, which
    may include transforming between different monk forms like Brewmaster, Windwalker,
    or Mistweaver. It is typically invoked during combat decision-making processes
    to ensure optimal performance and damage output.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's ID or index in the
      game world. This parameter allows the AI to assess the current target for form
      optimization decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeFormForSituation
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      monkAI->OptimizeFormForSituation(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal AI state tracking and form cooldowns.
    It may be called frequently during combat to dynamically adjust the monk's form
    based on changing conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid entity in the game
    world, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The method modifies internal AI
    state, so calling it at inappropriate times could disrupt normal AI flow.
