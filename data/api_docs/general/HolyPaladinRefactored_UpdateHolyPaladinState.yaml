documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of the Holy Paladin, including aura management and spell
    casting logic.
  description: The UpdateHolyPaladinState method is responsible for maintaining the
    current state of a Holy Paladin character within the TrinityCore framework. This
    includes managing active auras, handling spell cooldowns, updating holy power
    resources, and ensuring proper behavior during combat and non-combat scenarios.
    The method typically gets called during each update cycle to ensure that the paladin's
    state remains consistent with game mechanics and player actions. It may also handle
    interactions with other players or NPCs, as well as trigger appropriate visual
    effects or sound cues based on the current state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    if\
      \ (player && player->GetClass() == CLASS_PALADIN)\n    {\n        HolyPaladinRefactored*\
      \ holyPaladin = static_cast<HolyPaladinRefactored*>(player);\n        holyPaladin->UpdateHolyPaladinState();\n\
      \    }\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to ensure proper
    state management. It is recommended to call this method after any significant
    change in paladin state, such as spell casting or damage dealt. The implementation
    may involve checking for aura expiration, updating resource levels, and triggering
    appropriate combat behaviors.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from within combat handlers without ensuring
    thread safety, as it might modify shared resources. Also, calling this method
    too frequently can cause performance degradation in high-traffic scenarios.
