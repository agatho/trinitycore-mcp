documentation:
  brief: Distracts target unit from current target and redirects it to caster.
  description: This method implements the spell effect that causes a target unit to
    lose its current target and be redirected to the caster's position. It is commonly
    used in spells like 'Distract' or 'Seduction' where the target unit becomes temporarily
    distracted from its original target. The effect works by changing the target's
    aggro state, causing it to switch targets to the caster instead of maintaining
    its current target. This method is typically used in conjunction with other mechanics
    that control target selection and behavior.

    code: "void Spell::EffectDistract()\n{\n    // Implementation details\n    //\
      \ This method is called when a spell effect requires target redirection\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called within the context of spell effects that
    require target redirection. It typically involves modifying the target's aggro
    state and may require additional checks for valid targets. Performance considerations
    include ensuring that the target is not already in a state where redirection would
    cause conflicts or errors.
  warnings: This method can potentially cause issues if used on targets that are already
    in combat or when the target has no valid alternative targets to redirect to.
    Care must be taken to ensure that the spell effect does not create unintended
    consequences such as causing the target to lose all aggro or become unresponsive.
