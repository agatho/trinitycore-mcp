  class: DungeonScript
  method: HandleInterruptPriority
  signature: void DungeonScript::HandleInterruptPriority(int * player, int * boss)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the priority handling for a player's interaction with a dungeon
    boss.
  description: The HandleInterruptPriority method is responsible for managing the
    interruption of priority-based actions or events during dungeon encounters. This
    typically occurs when a player's current action is disrupted by an external event,
    such as a boss ability or environmental change. The method takes references to
    player and boss identifiers and modifies their state to reflect the interruption.
    It is commonly used in dungeon scripts to maintain proper encounter flow and ensure
    that player actions are appropriately handled during dynamic combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or state
      value. This parameter tracks the current player interaction priority within
      the dungeon context.
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the boss's identifier or state
      value. This parameter tracks the current boss behavior or priority during the
      encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Script
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player, Creature* boss)\n{\n\
      \    int playerID = player->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    int bossID = boss->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    HandleInterruptPriority(&playerID, &bossID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Priority Check
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::ProcessInterrupt()\n{\n    int playerPriority = GetPlayerPriority();\n\
      \    int bossPriority = GetBossPriority();\n    \n    if (playerPriority > bossPriority)\n\
      \    {\n        HandleInterruptPriority(&playerPriority, &bossPriority);\n \
      \       // Update encounter state\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the input parameters directly, so it should be used
    carefully to avoid unintended side effects. The implementation assumes valid integer
    values for player and boss identifiers. Consider thread safety when using this
    in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the player and boss pointers are properly initialized before
    calling this method. Incorrect handling of these values may lead to undefined
    behavior or game state corruption during dungeon encounters.
