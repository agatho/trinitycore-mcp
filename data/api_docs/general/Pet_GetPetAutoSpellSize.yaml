  method: GetPetAutoSpellSize
  signature: uint8 Pet::GetPetAutoSpellSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of auto-spells currently assigned to the pet.
  description: The GetPetAutoSpellSize method retrieves the count of auto-spells that
    are currently active and assigned to this pet. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, pets can have a set of spells that are automatically cast under
    certain conditions, such as when the pet is in combat or when specific triggers
    occur. This method provides access to the size of that auto-spell list, which
    is useful for iterating through the pet's auto-spells or checking if any are configured.
    The returned value represents how many auto-spells the pet currently has set up
    and will use during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of auto-spells assigned to this pet.
    Returns 0 if no auto-spells are configured.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Pet Has Auto Spells
    code: "if (pet->GetPetAutoSpellSize() > 0)\n{\n    // Pet has auto spells configured\n\
      \    // Proceed with logic to handle or iterate through them\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate Through Pet Auto Spells
    code: "uint8 spellCount = pet->GetPetAutoSpellSize();\nfor (uint8 i = 0; i < spellCount;\
      \ ++i)\n{\n    uint32 spellId = pet->GetPetAutoSpell(i);\n    // Process each\
      \ auto spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with GetPetAutoSpell() to retrieve
    individual auto-spell IDs. The auto-spell system is part of the pet's AI behavior
    and may be influenced by factors such as pet type, level, and player settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the pet object is valid before calling this method, as accessing
    an invalid pet pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method
    does not validate whether auto-spells are actually active or usable in combat.
