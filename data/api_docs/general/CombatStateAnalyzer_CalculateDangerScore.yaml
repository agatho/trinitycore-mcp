  method: CalculateDangerScore
  signature: float CombatStateAnalyzer::CalculateDangerScore() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a danger score representing the threat level of the
    current combat state.
  description: The CalculateDangerScore method evaluates various factors within the
    current combat scenario to determine an overall danger score. This score typically
    reflects the likelihood of player harm or the intensity of ongoing combat interactions.
    The method considers elements such as enemy health, attack power, proximity, and
    player defensive capabilities to compute this value. It is commonly used by AI
    systems and decision-making modules to assess risk levels during encounters. The
    returned float value usually ranges from 0.0 (no danger) to 1.0 (maximum danger),
    though exact scale may vary based on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the calculated danger score of the
    current combat state, where 0.0 indicates no threat and higher values indicate
    increasing levels of danger.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float danger = analyzer.CalculateDangerScore();\nif (danger > 0.7f) {\n\
      \    // Initiate defensive actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Decision Making
    code: "CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;\nfloat score = analyzer.CalculateDangerScore();\n\
      switch (static_cast<int>(score * 10)) {\n    case 0: case 1: case 2:\n     \
      \   // Safe to engage\n        break;\n    case 3: case 4: case 5:\n       \
      \ // Proceed with caution\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Avoid combat\
      \ or seek assistance\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during combat state updates and may cache
    results for performance reasons. The exact calculation logic depends on the implementation
    details of the CombatStateAnalyzer class, which might include enemy AI behavior,
    player stats, environmental factors, and combat history.
  warnings: The danger score is a relative measure that should not be used as an absolute
    indicator of survival probability. It may vary significantly based on the specific
    context and implementation of the analyzer. In high-frequency combat scenarios,
    repeated calls to this method might impact performance if not properly optimized.
