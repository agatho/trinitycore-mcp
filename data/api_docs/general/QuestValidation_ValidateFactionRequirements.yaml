api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateFactionRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateFactionRequirements(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets the faction requirements for a specified
    quest.
  description: The ValidateFactionRequirements method checks if the given player character
    satisfies all faction-related conditions required to accept or complete a specific
    quest. This includes verifying that the player's current faction alignment allows
    them to take the quest, and that any faction-specific quest flags or prerequisites
    are met. The method typically integrates with the game's faction system and quest
    logic to ensure proper progression and prevent players from accessing quests outside
    their allowed faction boundaries.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being validated. Must correspond
      to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose faction
      requirements are being checked. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all faction requirements for the specified
    quest; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Faction Validation Check
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateFactionRequirements(12345, player)) {\n  \
      \  // Player can accept or complete quest 12345\n    player->SendQuestComplete(12345);\n\
      } else {\n    // Player does not meet faction requirements\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the faction requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateFactionRequirements(quest->GetQuestId(),\
      \ this)) {\n        SendNotification(\"Your faction does not allow you to accept\
      \ this quest.\");\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest\
      \ acceptance logic\n    Player::OnQuestAccept(quest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal faction data structures and may involve database
    lookups for quest-specific faction conditions. It should be called before allowing
    a player to proceed with quest-related actions to maintain game balance and prevent
    exploits.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null reference will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also note that faction requirements can change dynamically based on in-game events
    or achievements.
