  method: UpdateTracking
  signature: void HunterAI::UpdateTracking()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the hunter's tracking ability state and target selection.
  description: The UpdateTracking method manages the internal state of a hunter's
    tracking ability within the AI system. It determines whether the hunter should
    track a target based on current conditions, such as target validity, distance,
    and combat state. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle to
    ensure the hunter's tracking behavior remains synchronized with the game environment.
    The method evaluates the hunter's current target and updates tracking status accordingly,
    potentially switching targets or disabling tracking if conditions are no longer
    met.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Update Call
    code: "void HunterAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateTracking();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update loop and should not be called directly
    from outside the AI system. The tracking behavior may depend on the hunter's current
    pet state, target validity, and combat conditions. Implementation assumes that
    the hunter has a valid target context and that tracking mechanics are properly
    initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the standard AI update cycle may cause
    inconsistent tracking states or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all preconditions
    for tracking (such as valid target and pet state) are met before calling this
    method.
