  class: BattlegroundQueue

  signature: void BattlegroundQueue::BattlegroundQueue(int queueId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a battleground queue with the specified queue ID.
  description: The BattlegroundQueue constructor initializes a battleground queue
    instance for the specified queue ID. This method sets up the internal state required
    to manage players entering and matching into battlegrounds. The queue ID typically
    corresponds to different battleground types such as Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch,
    or Eye of the Storm. This initialization is crucial for proper queue management
    and player matchmaking within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize a Battleground Queue
    code: 'BattlegroundQueue bgQueue(1);

      // Initializes a battleground queue with ID 1 for Alterac Valley'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the system when setting
    up battleground queues. Developers should not directly instantiate BattlegroundQueue
    objects unless implementing custom queue logic. The queue ID parameter determines
    which battleground type this queue manages.
