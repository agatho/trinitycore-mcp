  signature: bool DeathKnightAI::IsInMeleeRange(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit is within melee attack range for a Death
    Knight.
  description: The IsInMeleeRange method evaluates if a specified target unit is within
    the melee combat distance of the Death Knight AI. This function is crucial for
    determining when a Death Knight can perform melee attacks or abilities that require
    close proximity to the target. The method considers the Death Knight's current
    position, the target's position, and the defined melee range for the Death Knight
    class. It returns true if the target is within range, false otherwise. This functionality
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes to ensure that melee abilities
    are only executed when appropriate.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target to check for melee
      range. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is within melee range of the Death Knight
    AI, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (deathKnightAI->IsInMeleeRange(targetUnit)) {\n    // Execute melee\
      \ attack\n    deathKnightAI->DoMeleeAttack();\n} else {\n    // Move closer\
      \ or use ranged ability\n    deathKnightAI->MoveTowards(targetUnit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Conditional Combat Decision
    code: "if (deathKnightAI->IsInMeleeRange(enemy)) {\n    if (deathKnightAI->HasSpell(SPELL_DEATH_GRIP))\
      \ {\n        deathKnightAI->CastSpell(enemy, SPELL_DEATH_GRIP);\n    } else\
      \ {\n        deathKnightAI->AttackStart(enemy);\n    }\n} else {\n    deathKnightAI->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \    deathKnightAI->DoFollow(enemy);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the unit's current position and the target's position
    to calculate distance, taking into account the Death Knight's specific melee range.
    It may also consider factors such as movement speed or combat stance that could
    affect actual melee reach.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. The method assumes that both units
    are in the same map and have valid positions.
