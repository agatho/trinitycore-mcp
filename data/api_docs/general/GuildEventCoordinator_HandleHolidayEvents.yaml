    any holiday-themed activities or notifications that are associated with a specific

    system and triggers appropriate in-game actions such as sending messages, updating
    guild permissions, or modifying guild properties during festive periods. It operates
    on a per-guild basis using the provided guild identifier to ensure that only relevant
    holiday content is processed for that particular guild.
