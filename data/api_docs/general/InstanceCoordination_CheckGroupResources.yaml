  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: CheckGroupResources
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::CheckGroupResources(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Checks and validates group resource requirements for instance entry.
  description: The CheckGroupResources method evaluates whether a given group meets
    all necessary resource prerequisites to enter a specific instance. This includes
    verifying that group members have the required items, quest completions, or other
    in-game resources. The method typically performs these checks before allowing
    group entry into an instance, ensuring game balance and preventing unauthorized
    access. It may also update internal state tracking for group resource usage and
    can trigger resource deduction upon successful validation.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group attempting
      to enter an instance. Must be a valid group with at least one member, otherwise
      behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance entry handler
    code: "void HandleInstanceEntry(Player* player, InstanceTemplate* instance)\n\
      {\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n    {\n        sInstanceCoordination->CheckGroupResources(group);\n\
      \        // Proceed with instance entry logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during instance entry validation and may
    have performance implications when processing large groups. It's recommended to
    call this only when necessary, such as before allowing group entry into a restricted
    instance.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid Group pointer may result in undefined behavior.
    The method assumes that the group has already been validated for membership and
    leadership status.
