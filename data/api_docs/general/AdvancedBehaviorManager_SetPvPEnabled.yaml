  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: SetPvPEnabled
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::SetPvPEnabled(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables PvP functionality within the advanced behavior manager.
  description: The SetPvPEnabled method controls whether Player versus Player (PvP)
    mechanics are active for the associated behavior manager instance. This method
    allows developers to dynamically toggle PvP states during runtime, which can be
    useful for implementing custom PvP zones, temporary PvP restrictions, or managing
    player engagement in PvP environments. The change takes effect immediately and
    affects all players governed by this behavior manager. This functionality is particularly
    relevant in custom TrinityCore modules where fine-grained control over PvP behavior
    is required.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      PvP functionality.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable PvP for a Behavior Manager
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = new AdvancedBehaviorManager();

      behaviorMgr->SetPvPEnabled(true); // Enables PvP

      // Player interactions will now allow PvP combat'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable PvP Based on Game State
    code: "if (gameState == GameState::EVENT_ACTIVE)\n{\n    behaviorMgr->SetPvPEnabled(false);\
      \ // Disable PvP during event\n}\nelse\n{\n    behaviorMgr->SetPvPEnabled(true);\
      \  // Re-enable PvP otherwise\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags or state variables within the
    AdvancedBehaviorManager class. It's important to note that enabling/disabling
    PvP may require synchronization with other systems such as area triggers, player
    state machines, or zone-specific rules. The behavior manager should ensure that
    any existing PvP interactions are properly handled when toggling this setting.
  warnings: Improper use of this method might lead to inconsistent player states or
    unexpected combat behavior. Ensure that all related systems (such as area triggers,
    player flags, and combat state) are properly synchronized with the PvP status
    change. Avoid frequent toggling during active combat scenarios to prevent client-side
    desynchronization.
