  class: VendorInteraction
  method: CalculateSellingValue
  signature: uint32 VendorInteraction::CalculateSellingValue(Player * player, const
    int & itemGuids)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the total selling value of items in a player's inventory.
  description: The CalculateSellingValue method determines the monetary worth of items
    that can be sold by a player to a vendor. It evaluates the item GUIDs provided
    and computes their combined sell value based on the vendor's buying rates and
    item properties. This method is typically invoked during vendor interaction sessions
    when a player attempts to sell items back to the vendor. The calculation considers
    factors such as item quality, stack size, and vendor-specific pricing modifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose inventory items are being evaluated
      for selling value.
  - name: itemGuids
    description: Reference to an integer representing the GUID of the item(s) being
      assessed. This parameter may represent a single item or a collection of items
      depending on implementation.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total gold amount that would be
    received from selling the specified items to the vendor.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      int itemGuid = 12345;

      uint32 totalValue = VendorInteraction::CalculateSellingValue(player, itemGuid);

      printf("Total selling value: %u gold\n", totalValue);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has sufficient permissions and access
    to the items specified by their GUIDs. The actual calculation logic may vary based
    on vendor type, faction, reputation, and other game mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that itemGuids correspond to valid items in the player's inventory;
    otherwise, undefined behavior or incorrect results may occur. This method should
    not be called outside of a proper vendor interaction context.
