documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and state reset operations when a Druid AI character exits
    combat mode.
  description: The OnCombatEnd method is invoked by the TrinityCore AI system when
    a Druid character transitions out of combat. This method handles necessary cleanup
    tasks such as resetting combat-related flags, stopping ongoing combat abilities,
    and restoring the AI to its default non-combat state. It ensures that the druid's
    behavior returns to normal after combat has concluded, including any necessary
    resource management or state synchronization. The method is automatically called
    by the core AI framework and should not be invoked manually unless implementing
    custom AI logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Custom Druid AI
    code: "class MyDruidAI : public DruidAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatEnd() override\
      \ {\n        // Custom cleanup logic before calling base implementation\n  \
      \      DruidAI::OnCombatEnd();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the AI framework's internal combat state
    management system. Developers should avoid calling this method directly unless
    extending or overriding its behavior in custom AI implementations. The base implementation
    ensures proper synchronization of the druid's state with the game world.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually during normal gameplay as it may cause
    inconsistent AI states or unexpected behavior. If overriding this method, always
    ensure to call the parent implementation to maintain proper AI framework functionality.
