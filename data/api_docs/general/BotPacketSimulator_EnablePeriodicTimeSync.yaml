  class: BotPacketSimulator
  method: EnablePeriodicTimeSync
  signature: void BotPacketSimulator::EnablePeriodicTimeSync()
documentation:
  brief: Enables periodic time synchronization for bot packet simulation.
  description: The EnablePeriodicTimeSync method activates a background timer that
    periodically synchronizes the simulation time with the actual game time. This
    ensures that bot behaviors and actions remain consistent with the server's time
    progression, preventing desynchronization issues during extended simulations or
    long-running bot operations. The method typically initializes internal timing
    mechanisms and starts a recurring task that updates time-related state variables
    at regular intervals.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPacketSimulator simulator;

      simulator.EnablePeriodicTimeSync();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting any bot simulation to ensure
    accurate time handling. The periodic synchronization interval is typically determined
    by the internal implementation and may vary based on configuration settings or
    performance requirements.
