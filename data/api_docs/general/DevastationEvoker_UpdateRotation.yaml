  class: DevastationEvoker
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void DevastationEvoker::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the evoker's rotation behavior based on the current target.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for managing and updating
    the combat rotation logic of a DevastationEvoker instance. It evaluates the current
    state of the evoker and its target to determine the appropriate actions to take
    during combat, such as casting spells or applying abilities. This method typically
    integrates with the AI system to ensure that the evoker follows a strategic rotation
    tailored for maximum damage output or survivability depending on the game context.
    The method is called regularly by the core AI framework during combat updates.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the current target of the
      evoker. This parameter is essential for determining the appropriate rotation
      behavior, as it defines the enemy or creature the evoker should focus on.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyEvokerAI::Update()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = me->GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        m_devastationEvoker.UpdateRotation(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within an AI update loop and should
    not be called manually unless implementing custom AI logic. It assumes that the
    target is valid and in combat range.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
