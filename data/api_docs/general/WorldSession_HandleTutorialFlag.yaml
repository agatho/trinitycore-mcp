documentation:
  brief: Sets a tutorial flag for the player based on the provided packet data.
  description: The HandleTutorialFlag method processes incoming tutorial flag data
    from a client packet and updates the player's tutorial state accordingly. This
    method is part of the WorldSession class and handles communication between the
    game client and server regarding tutorial progress. It typically manages flags
    that control which tutorials or hints are displayed to players, ensuring appropriate
    gameplay guidance without overwhelming new players. The method does not return
    any value but modifies internal session state related to tutorial completion.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: A WorldPackets::Misc::TutorialSetFlag packet containing the tutorial
      flag identifier to be set for the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Tutorial Flag
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleTutorialFlag(WorldPackets::Misc::TutorialSetFlag&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process tutorial flag setting\n    SetTutorialFlag(packet.Flag);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a client sends a tutorial flag update.
    It's important to note that tutorial flags are used internally by the game engine
    to determine which UI elements or hints should be shown to players during their
    first encounters with specific gameplay mechanics.
