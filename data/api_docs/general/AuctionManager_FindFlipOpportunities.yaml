  class: AuctionManager
  method: FindFlipOpportunities
  signature: int AuctionManager::FindFlipOpportunities(Player * bot, uint32 auctionHouseId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes auction house listings to identify profitable flipping opportunities
    for a given bot player.
  description: The FindFlipOpportunities method scans the specified auction house
    for items that can be purchased at a lower price and sold at a higher price, calculating
    potential profits. It evaluates current market prices, item values, and associated
    fees to determine viable arbitrage opportunities. This method is typically used
    by bot players or automated systems to optimize their in-game economy strategies.
    The function requires a valid player object representing the bot and a valid auction
    house identifier. It returns the count of identified flip opportunities, or zero
    if none are found.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will evaluate
      auction listings for flipping opportunities. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: auctionHouseId
    description: Identifier of the auction house to analyze. Valid values correspond
      to known auction house entries in the game database (e.g., 1 for Orgrimmar,
      2 for Stormwind).
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of profitable flipping opportunities
    found. A value of zero indicates no viable opportunities were identified.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nint flipCount = sAuctionMgr->FindFlipOpportunities(myBot,\
      \ 1);\nif (flipCount > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"auction\", \"Found %d flipping\
      \ opportunities.\", flipCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Profit Calculation
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nuint32 auctionHouseId = 2; // Stormwind Auction House\n\
      int opportunities = sAuctionMgr->FindFlipOpportunities(bot, auctionHouseId);\n\
      if (opportunities > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"auction\", \"Bot found %d potential\
      \ profit-making flips.\", opportunities);\n    // Additional logic to process\
      \ and execute flips could follow\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries against auction house listings
    and may involve caching or precomputed data structures for performance. It is
    intended for use in bot automation systems and should not be called excessively
    without consideration of server load.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and that the auctionHouseId
    corresponds to an existing auction house entry, otherwise behavior is undefined.
    This method may cause performance overhead if used frequently or on large datasets.
