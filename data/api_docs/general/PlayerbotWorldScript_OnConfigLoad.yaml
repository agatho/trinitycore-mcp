  class: PlayerbotWorldScript
  method: OnConfigLoad
  signature: void PlayerbotWorldScript::OnConfigLoad(bool reload)
documentation:
  brief: Loads or reloads player bot configuration settings when the world script
    initializes or updates.
  description: The OnConfigLoad method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework to
    notify the PlayerbotWorldScript when configuration files have been loaded or reloaded.
    This method allows the script to process and apply any updated settings related
    to player bot behavior, such as AI strategies, movement patterns, or interaction
    rules. It typically executes during server startup and whenever a configuration
    reload command is issued via the game console or admin interface. The method does
    not require explicit invocation by other code components and is automatically
    called by the core system.
  parameters:
  - name: reload
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the configuration is being reloaded
      (true) or initially loaded (false). When true, the method should handle updating
      existing settings without disrupting current bot operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Load Handling
    code: "void PlayerbotWorldScript::OnConfigLoad(bool reload)\n{\n    if (reload)\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle reloading of bot settings\n        sPlayerbotAIConfig->Load();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Initial load of bot settings\n        sPlayerbotAIConfig->Initialize();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WorldScript interface in TrinityCore and should
    be implemented to ensure proper synchronization of player bot configurations.
    It's recommended to use this method for initializing or updating global AI settings
    that affect all active bots.
