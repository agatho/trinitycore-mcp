documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current skill indicators for the player's active skill profile.
  description: The GetCurrentSkill method returns a SkillIndicators structure that
    encapsulates the player's current skill state, including their active skill level,
    progress, and related metadata. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    player skill management systems to determine the player's proficiency in a specific
    skill or set of skills. The returned data reflects the real-time state of the
    player's skill profile at the time of invocation. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is safe for repeated calls during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SkillIndicators object containing current skill data such as level, progress,
    and other relevant skill metrics. Returns an empty or default-initialized SkillIndicators
    structure if no active skill profile exists or if the player has not yet acquired
    any skills.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SkillIndicators currentSkill = player->GetSkillProfile()->GetCurrentSkill();\n\
      if (currentSkill.IsValid()) {\n    std::cout << \"Current skill level: \" <<\
      \ currentSkill.GetLevel() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Skill Progress Monitoring
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* profile = player->GetSkillProfile();

      SkillIndicators indicators = profile->GetCurrentSkill();

      uint32 currentLevel = indicators.GetLevel();

      uint32 progress = indicators.GetProgress();

      uint32 maxProgress = indicators.GetMaxProgress();

      float progressPercent = (static_cast<float>(progress) / maxProgress) * 100.0f;

      std::cout << "Skill Progress: " << progressPercent << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the player's skill profile data and should be used judiciously
    in performance-critical code paths. The returned SkillIndicators object is a copy,
    so modifications to it will not affect the original skill state. This method assumes
    that the player has an active skill profile; otherwise, it may return default
    or invalid indicators.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned SkillIndicators object contains valid
    data without checking its validity first. In some cases, especially during character
    initialization or when no skills are acquired, the result may be empty or uninitialized.
    Always validate the returned structure before using its contents.
