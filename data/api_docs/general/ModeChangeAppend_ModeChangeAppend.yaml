  class: ModeChangeAppend
  method: ModeChangeAppend
  signature: void ModeChangeAppend::ModeChangeAppend(const int & guid, uint8 oldFlags,
    uint8 newFlags)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a mode change event for a player with specified old and new flags.
  description: The ModeChangeAppend method is used to record or append a mode change
    event for a player identified by their GUID. This method takes the player's unique
    identifier, along with their previous and current flag states, and processes this
    information typically for logging, tracking, or synchronization purposes within
    the TrinityCore framework. The flags likely represent various game modes or states
    such as combat, stealth, or PvP status. This method is generally part of internal
    systems that monitor player behavior or maintain game state consistency across
    the server.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose mode change is being
      recorded. This value should be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore database.
  - name: oldFlags
    description: The previous state flags of the player before the mode change occurred.
      These flags represent the player's prior game mode or status settings.
  - name: newFlags
    description: The new state flags of the player after the mode change has taken
      place. These flags represent the updated game mode or status settings for the
      player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mode Change Append Usage
    code: 'ModeChangeAppend playerModeChanger;

      playerModeChanger.ModeChangeAppend(12345, 0x01, 0x03); // Player GUID 12345
      changes from flag 0x01 to 0x03'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's AI or game state management
    systems. It may be part of a larger system that tracks player behavior, logs events,
    or synchronizes game states across different subsystems. Ensure that the GUID
    and flag values are valid to prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid GUIDs or malformed flags could
    lead to data corruption or inconsistent game state tracking. This method should
    only be called when a legitimate mode change occurs for a player.
