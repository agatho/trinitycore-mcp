documentation:
  brief: Returns the next quest in the quest chain for the player.
  description: The GetNextQuest method retrieves the next quest in a quest chain,
    typically used when a player has completed a quest and needs to advance to the
    next quest in sequence. This method is essential for handling quest progression
    within the game's quest system, particularly when dealing with quest chains that
    involve multiple steps or objectives. It ensures proper quest advancement by returning
    the next quest in the sequence based on the current quest status and player's
    progress.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the quest giver object, typically representing the NPC
      or object that provides the quest. This parameter is used to determine which
      quest giver the quest should be retrieved from.
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the current quest object, used to determine which quest
      chain to follow and what the next quest should be based on the player's progress
      and completion status.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the next quest in the quest chain. If no next quest
    exists or if the quest is invalid, it returns nullptr. This indicates that the
    player has completed all quests in the chain or that there are no more quests
    available for progression.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "const Quest* nextQuest = player->GetNextQuest(&questGiver, quest);\nif\
      \ (nextQuest != nullptr)\n{\n    // Proceed with the next quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "const Quest* nextQuest = player->GetNextQuest(&questGiver, quest);\nif\
      \ (nextQuest != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the quest chain\n    player->AddQuestProgress(nextQuest->GetId());\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle no more quests in chain\n    player->CompleteQuest(quest->GetId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest progression system and should be used carefully
    when handling quest chains. It relies on internal quest data structures and may
    not work properly if the quest chain is not properly initialized or if the player's
    quest progress is not correctly tracked.
  warnings: The method may return nullptr if the quest chain has been completed or
    if there are no more quests available. Care should be taken to ensure that the
    quest giver and quest parameters are valid before calling this method, as invalid
    pointers can lead to crashes or incorrect behavior.
