  class: SmartAI
  method: LoadPath
  signature: const int * SmartAI::LoadPath(uint32 entry)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and returns a path for the SmartAI instance based on the entry ID.
  description: 'The LoadPath method retrieves or initializes a path associated with
    the given entry ID within the SmartAI system. This method is typically used in
    World of Warcraft''s TrinityCore to manage AI movement paths for creatures or
    game objects. It returns a pointer to an array of integers representing waypoints
    or path data. The method may internally load path data from database tables or
    cached structures depending on the implementation. Precondition: The entry ID
    must correspond to a valid path defined in the database. Postcondition: A valid
    path data structure is returned, or nullptr if no path exists for the given entry.'
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int pointer to the first element of an integer array representing
    the path waypoints, or nullptr if no path is found for the specified entry.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SmartAI* ai = ...;\nconst int* path = ai->LoadPath(12345);\nif (path !=\
      \ nullptr) {\n    // Process path data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI framework where paths are pre-defined
    in the database. The returned integer array typically contains coordinates or
    node identifiers that define movement patterns. Performance may be impacted if
    paths are loaded dynamically from disk or database on each call.
  warnings: Ensure that the entry ID passed to LoadPath corresponds to an existing
    path definition in the database, otherwise the method will return nullptr and
    attempting to access the returned pointer could cause a crash. The returned pointer
    should not be modified as it points to internal data structures.
