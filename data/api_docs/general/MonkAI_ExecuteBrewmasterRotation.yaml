  class: MonkAI
  method: ExecuteBrewmasterRotation
  signature: void MonkAI::ExecuteBrewmasterRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Brewmaster monk's combat rotation logic based on current target
    and spell availability.
  description: The ExecuteBrewmasterRotation method implements the core AI decision-making
    process for a Brewmaster monk character in TrinityCore. It evaluates the current
    combat state, target health, available spells, and cooldowns to determine the
    optimal sequence of actions. The method considers factors such as mana levels,
    damage-over-time effects, and defensive abilities to maximize damage output while
    maintaining survivability. This function is typically called during the AI update
    cycle when the monk needs to make tactical decisions in combat.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's ID or index within
      the game world. Used to identify which enemy the monk should focus on during
      rotation execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BrewmasterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        ExecuteBrewmasterRotation(&targetId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the monk has valid access to spell data and combat
    state information. It relies on the underlying AI framework to provide accurate
    target selection and resource tracking. Performance is optimized for real-time
    execution during combat updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid unit before calling
    this method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer may cause undefined behavior
    or crashes in the game engine.
