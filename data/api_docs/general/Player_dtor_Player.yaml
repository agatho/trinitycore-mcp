documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Player object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The Player destructor is automatically invoked when a Player object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It performs necessary cleanup operations
    such as releasing memory allocated for player data, removing the player from game
    systems, and ensuring that all associated resources are properly freed. This destructor
    is part of the standard C++ object lifecycle management and is typically not called
    directly by developers. The destruction process ensures that the player character
    is cleanly removed from the game world, including cleanup of any pending actions,
    removal from the player list, and proper handling of any ongoing game mechanics
    such as combat or quest states.

  - title: Automatic destruction of Player object
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    Player* player = new Player();\n    // ... perform\
      \ operations with player ...\n    delete player; // Triggers ~Player destructor\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Player destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when a Player
    object is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless
    implementing custom memory management or object pooling patterns. The destructor
    ensures that all game systems are notified of the player's departure and that
    resources are properly reclaimed.
