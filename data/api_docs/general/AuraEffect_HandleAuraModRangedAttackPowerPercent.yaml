  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleAuraModRangedAttackPowerPercent
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModRangedAttackPowerPercent(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a percentage-based modifier to the ranged attack power
    of the affected unit.
  description: The HandleAuraModRangedAttackPowerPercent method is responsible for
    modifying the ranged attack power of a unit by a specified percentage when an
    aura is applied or removed. This method is typically invoked during aura application
    or removal events, adjusting the target's ranged attack power stat accordingly.
    The modification is calculated based on the aura's effect value and applied to
    the affected unit's current ranged attack power. This functionality supports various
    game mechanics such as buffs, debuffs, and passive abilities that modify a character's
    ranged combat effectiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. Contains information about the aura's state, target, and
      application context.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation indicating how the aura should be handled.
      Typically used to determine whether to apply or remove the effect, with specific
      values controlling different aspects of the aura behavior.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the aura effect. When true, the percentage modifier is added to the target's
      ranged attack power; when false, it is removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Ranged Attack Power Buff
    code: 'AuraEffect* auraEffect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      auraEffect->HandleAuraModRangedAttackPowerPercent(app, 1, true); // Apply 10%
      increase'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Ranged Attack Power Debuff
    code: 'AuraEffect* auraEffect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      auraEffect->HandleAuraModRangedAttackPowerPercent(app, 2, false); // Remove
      15% decrease'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the unit's attack power stat and should
    be used carefully to avoid unintended gameplay effects. The percentage modifier
    is typically stored in the aura's effect data and applied using standard game
    mechanics for stat modification.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect combat calculations
    or visual inconsistencies. Ensure that the aura application context and mode values
    are correctly set before calling this method.
