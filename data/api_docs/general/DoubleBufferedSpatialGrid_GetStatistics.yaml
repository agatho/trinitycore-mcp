  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: Statistics DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical information about the spatial grid's current state
    and performance metrics.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a Statistics object containing detailed
    information about the internal state of the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid. This includes
    data such as the number of active cells, total entities managed, memory usage,
    and performance-related metrics. The statistics are gathered from both buffers
    in the double-buffered structure to provide an accurate snapshot of the grid's
    current condition. This method is typically used for debugging, monitoring, or
    optimizing spatial partitioning behavior within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Statistics object containing key metrics about the grid's state including
    cell counts, entity totals, memory usage, and performance data from both active
    buffers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Grid Performance
    code: 'DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid grid;

      // ... populate grid with entities ...

      auto stats = grid.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Active cells: " << stats.activeCells << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Total entities: " << stats.totalEntities << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Statistics for Debugging Spatial Grid Issues
    code: "void DebugSpatialGrid(DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid& grid) {\n    auto stats\
      \ = grid.GetStatistics();\n    if (stats.totalEntities > 10000) {\n        //\
      \ Log warning about potential performance issues\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      High entity count in spatial grid: %u\", stats.totalEntities);\n    }\n    if\
      \ (stats.memoryUsage > 1024 * 1024) { // 1MB threshold\n        sLog->outWarning(\"\
      Spatial grid memory usage high: %u KB\", stats.memoryUsage / 1024);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is a snapshot taken at the time of the call
    and may not reflect real-time changes. The method performs a read operation on
    both buffers, which could involve locking mechanisms depending on implementation.
    For high-frequency monitoring, consider caching results or using sampling intervals
    to avoid performance overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently in performance-critical sections can introduce
    overhead due to data collection and potential synchronization requirements. Ensure
    that statistics gathering doesn't interfere with real-time game updates or cause
    deadlocks in multi-threaded environments.
