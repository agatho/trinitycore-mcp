  method: setEnableHeightCalc
  signature: void IVMapManager::setEnableHeightCalc(bool pVal)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables height calculation for the map manager.
  description: The setEnableHeightCalc method controls whether the IVMapManager performs
    height calculations for terrain and object interactions. This functionality is
    crucial for determining if a point in 3D space is above or below ground level,
    which affects collision detection, line-of-sight checks, and movement validation
    in the game world. When enabled, the system calculates accurate heights for map
    tiles; when disabled, it may use simplified or default height values, potentially
    impacting gameplay mechanics such as flying movement or object placement. The
    setting can be changed at runtime to optimize performance or adjust behavior during
    specific game events.
  parameters:
  - name: pVal
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      height calculation functionality.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Height Calculation
    code: 'IVMapManager* vmapManager = VMAP::VMapFactory::createOrGetVMapManager();

      vmapManager->setEnableHeightCalc(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Height Calculation for Performance
    code: 'IVMapManager* vmapManager = VMAP::VMapFactory::createOrGetVMapManager();

      vmapManager->setEnableHeightCalc(false); // Disables height calc for performance
      optimization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the entire map manager's behavior and should be used
    carefully during runtime. Changing this setting may require reloading affected
    map data or reinitializing certain subsystems to ensure proper operation.
  warnings: Disabling height calculation can lead to incorrect collision detection,
    movement validation issues, and unexpected behavior in gameplay mechanics that
    rely on accurate terrain height information.
