  class: RuneInfo
  method: Update
  signature: void RuneInfo::Update(uint32 diff, float hasteModifier)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the rune state based on elapsed time and haste modifier.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing the cooldown progression
    of runes for player characters. It processes the time elapsed since the last update
    and applies the haste modifier to determine how much cooldown time should be consumed.
    This method is typically called during game ticks to ensure runes regenerate properly
    according to the player's haste statistics and game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value determines how much cooldown time should be processed.
  - name: hasteModifier
    description: A multiplier representing the player's haste percentage. Values greater
      than 1.0 accelerate rune regeneration, while values less than 1.0 slow it down.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic rune update call
    code: 'RuneInfo rune;

      uint32 deltaTime = 1000; // 1 second

      float hasteMod = 1.2f; // 20% haste

      rune.Update(deltaTime, hasteMod);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects player combat abilities in World of Warcraft,
    particularly for Death Knights who rely on runes for their special attacks. The
    implementation must be called regularly to maintain accurate rune cooldowns.
