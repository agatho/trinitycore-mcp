  signature: int SupportMgr::GetLastChange() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the timestamp of the last change made to support ticket data.
  description: The GetLastChange method returns an integer representing the Unix timestamp
    of when the last modification was recorded in the support ticket system. This
    value is typically used to determine if any updates have occurred since a previous
    check, enabling efficient synchronization or caching mechanisms. The method does
    not require any parameters and is read-only, making it safe for concurrent access.
    It's commonly used in administrative interfaces or automated systems that monitor
    support ticket activity.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the Unix timestamp of the last change. A value
    of 0 indicates no changes have been recorded yet, while a positive integer represents
    the time of the most recent modification.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check for Updates
    code: "SupportMgr* supportMgr = sWorld->GetSupportMgr();\nint lastChange = supportMgr->GetLastChange();\n\
      if (lastChange > previousCheckTime)\n{\n    // Process updated support tickets\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"New support ticket changes detected at {}\", lastChange);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached internally to avoid repeated database queries.
    The returned value should be treated as a snapshot in time and may not reflect
    real-time changes without explicit synchronization.
