  signature: void Player::RemoveActiveQuest(uint32 questId, bool update)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an active quest from the player's quest log.
  description: The RemoveActiveQuest method removes a specific quest from the player's
    active quest log, effectively clearing the quest from their current objectives.
    This method is typically used when a quest has been completed or when a player
    needs to abandon a quest. The method updates the player's quest log accordingly,
    ensuring that the quest no longer appears in their active quests list. It also
    handles any associated quest-related data cleanup, such as removing quest objectives
    and updating the player's quest status.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be removed from the player's
      active quest log. This is typically a numeric value representing the quest ID
      in the database.
  - name: update
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to update the player's quest log
      immediately. If true, the method will perform immediate updates; if false, it
      may defer the update until a later time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveActiveQuest(12345, true);

      // Removes quest ID 12345 from the player''s active quest log'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      bool update = false;

      player->RemoveActiveQuest(questId, update);

      // Removes quest ID 12345 without immediate update, allowing for batch processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest completion or abandonment
    logic. The method may trigger updates to the player's quest log and associated
    data structures. It is important to note that this method does not remove quest
    rewards or related items from the player's inventory, only the active quest itself.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest status updates,
    potentially causing quest-related issues in the game world. Care should be taken
    when removing quests that are part of a chain or have dependencies with other
    quests.
