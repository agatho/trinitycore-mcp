  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleAuraFeatherFall
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraFeatherFall(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes the Feather Fall aura effect, allowing the target to fall
    slowly without taking damage.
  description: The HandleAuraFeatherFall method manages the application and removal
    of the Feather Fall aura effect on a target. This aura allows the affected unit
    to fall from great heights without sustaining damage, effectively making them
    float gently to the ground. The method is invoked during aura application or removal
    events and adjusts the target's movement and fall mechanics accordingly. It handles
    both the visual and mechanical aspects of the feather fall effect, ensuring that
    the player or creature can safely descend from high elevations.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. Contains information about the aura's state and target.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of the aura application, typically indicating whether it
      is being applied (1) or removed (0). Used for internal processing logic.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura is being applied (true) or removed
      (false). Controls the direction of effect handling.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura application
    code: "void MyAuraHandler::HandleFeatherFall(const AuraApplication* aurApp, uint8\
      \ mode, bool apply) const {\n    if (apply) {\n        // Apply feather fall\
      \ effect\n        target->SetCanFly(true);\n        target->SetHover(true);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Remove feather fall effect\n        target->SetCanFly(false);\n\
      \        target->SetHover(false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's aura system and is typically called
    internally by the core engine when an aura is applied or removed. Developers should
    not directly call this method unless implementing custom aura effects. The feather
    fall effect modifies movement behavior rather than simply preventing fall damage.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the apply flag may result in inconsistent movement
    states for the target. Ensure that all related visual and mechanical effects are
    properly synchronized when modifying the target's flight/hover state.
