  signature: int Player::GetGuildId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the guild identifier that the player belongs to.
  description: The GetGuildId method retrieves the unique identifier (ID) of the guild
    to which the player currently belongs. This method is commonly used in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine a player's guild membership for
    various game mechanics, including guild-related quests, permissions, and interactions.
    The returned value represents the internal guild ID stored in the database, which
    can be used to query guild information or perform operations related to guild
    management. This method does not require any parameters and returns zero if the
    player is not part of a guild.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the guild ID that the player belongs to.
    If the player is not in a guild, this value will be zero. The returned value corresponds
    to the internal database ID used by TrinityCore for guild management.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int guildId = player->GetGuildId();\nif (guildId != 0)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ is in a guild\n    // Do something with the guild ID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player\
      \ is not in a guild\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be safely called from any thread context.
    Performance-wise, it involves a simple database lookup which is negligible for
    most applications. The method relies on the player's internal state being properly
    initialized by the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns zero when the player is not in a guild,
    which may lead to confusion if not handled properly in code logic. Also note that
    the returned value does not represent a unique identifier (GUID) but rather an
    ID used internally by the database system.
