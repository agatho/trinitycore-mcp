documentation:
  brief: Clears the line-of-sight cache to remove all stored visibility data
  description: The ClearCache method invalidates and removes all cached line-of-sight
    data from the LineOfSightManager. This ensures that subsequent visibility checks
    will recalculate results rather than using previously stored data. The cache is
    typically used to optimize performance by avoiding redundant calculations, but
    may need clearing when environmental changes occur or when the manager's state
    requires a reset. This method does not take any parameters and performs no return
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Clear Usage
    code: 'LineOfSightManager* losManager = GetMap()->GetLineOfSightManager();

      losManager->ClearCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during map transitions, object removals,
    or when environmental changes affect visibility calculations. The cache clearing
    operation is lightweight and does not block other operations.
