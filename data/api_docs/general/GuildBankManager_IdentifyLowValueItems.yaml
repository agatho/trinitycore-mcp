  class: GuildBankManager
  method: IdentifyLowValueItems
  signature: int GuildBankManager::IdentifyLowValueItems(int * guild)
documentation:
  brief: Identifies and returns the count of low-value items in the guild bank.
  description: The IdentifyLowValueItems method scans all items stored within the
    guild bank and determines which items are considered low-value based on predefined
    criteria such as item level, quality, or market value. This function is typically
    used by guild management tools or automated systems to help guild leaders identify
    items that may be candidates for removal or reassignment. The method does not
    modify any data but provides a count of qualifying items for further processing
    or display purposes. It requires the guild bank to be accessible and properly
    initialized before execution.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier. This parameter
      is used internally by the method to locate and access the correct guild's bank
      data.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the number of low-value items found in the
    guild bank. A return value of zero indicates no low-value items were detected,
    while a positive integer represents the total count of such items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int guildId = 12345;\nint lowValueCount = guildBankManager->IdentifyLowValueItems(&guildId);\n\
      if (lowValueCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << lowValueCount << \"\
      \ low-value items in the guild bank.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that item valuation logic has already been established
    within the GuildBankManager class. Performance may vary depending on the number
    of items stored in the guild bank, as each item must be evaluated against the
    low-value criteria.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided guild identifier is valid and corresponds to
    an active guild; otherwise, the method may return unexpected results or cause
    undefined behavior.
