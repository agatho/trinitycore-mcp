  brief: Assigns a dungeon role to the player based on their behavior and group composition
  description: The AssignDungeonRole method determines and assigns an appropriate
    dungeon role (such as tank, healer, or damage dealer) to a player within a dungeon
    environment. This method evaluates the player's current class, specialization,
    gear, and group dynamics to assign them a role that optimizes the group's performance.
    The assignment process considers the player's capabilities and the needs of the
    dungeon encounter to ensure balanced team composition. This method is typically
    invoked during dungeon entry or when group composition changes dynamically.

  notes: This method is part of the advanced AI system and should only be called when
    a player enters a dungeon or when group composition changes. The role assignment
    logic may vary based on the specific dungeon type and encounter mechanics.
