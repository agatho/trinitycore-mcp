  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: GetActiveCasts
  signature: int InterruptAwareness::GetActiveCasts() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of active spell casts currently in progress for the InterruptAwareness
    instance.
  description: The GetActiveCasts method retrieves the count of ongoing spell casts
    associated with the InterruptAwareness object. This is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to track how many spells
    are currently being cast by a unit or player, which can be important for determining
    interruptibility, casting behavior, and combat state management. The method does
    not distinguish between different types of casts (e.g., instant vs. channeled)
    but simply returns the total number of active casts. This value is often used
    internally by the core game mechanics to enforce rules such as preventing certain
    actions while a spell is casting or managing interrupt events.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of active spell casts currently
    tracked by this InterruptAwareness instance. A return value of zero indicates
    no active casts are occurring.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Casts
    code: "InterruptAwareness* awareness = unit->GetInterruptAwareness();\nint activeCasts\
      \ = awareness->GetActiveCasts();\nif (activeCasts > 0)\n{\n    // Unit is currently\
      \ casting a spell\n    // Handle interruptible actions or state changes\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other interrupt-related
    functionality such as checking if a unit can be interrupted, managing spell queues,
    or enforcing game rules around simultaneous spell casting. The returned value
    may change dynamically during combat as spells begin and end.
  warnings: The method returns only the count of active casts and does not provide
    information about which specific spells are active. For detailed cast information,
    additional methods like GetCastSpell() or similar would be required. Also, in
    multi-threaded environments, ensure thread safety when accessing this value if
    it's being modified concurrently.
