  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: SetAutoTeleport
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::SetAutoTeleport(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic teleportation for a leader-follow behavior.
  description: The SetAutoTeleport method configures whether a creature or unit governed
    by the LeaderFollowBehavior will automatically teleport to its leader when it
    falls too far behind. This functionality is commonly used in group quests, scripted
    events, or AI-controlled creatures that need to maintain proximity to their leader.
    When enabled, the behavior will trigger a teleportation event if the follower's
    distance exceeds a predefined threshold. The method does not perform any immediate
    action but sets an internal flag that affects future movement decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether automatic teleportation should
      be enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto Teleport for a Follower
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = unit->GetAI()->GetBehavior<LeaderFollowBehavior>();

      behavior->SetAutoTeleport(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto Teleport During Special Event
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = player->GetAI()->GetBehavior<LeaderFollowBehavior>();

      behavior->SetAutoTeleport(false);

      // Perform custom logic without automatic teleportation

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal AI state and should be called before the behavior
    is actively used. The actual teleportation logic depends on distance thresholds
    defined within the AI system and may vary based on creature type or quest context.
  warnings: Calling this method during active movement or combat may cause unexpected
    behavior if the follower's position is not properly synchronized with its leader.
    Ensure that any teleportation logic is handled carefully to avoid breaking quest
    progression or group mechanics.
