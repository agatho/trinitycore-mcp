  signature: bool Spell::IsAutoRepeat() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is currently in an auto-repeat state.
  description: The IsAutoRepeat method checks if a spell is actively being repeated
    automatically, typically used for spells that have an auto-repeat mechanism such
    as shooting or casting. This method returns true when the spell is in an auto-repeat
    state, indicating that the spell will continue to trigger repeatedly until manually
    stopped or until the player's target changes. The method is commonly used in game
    mechanics to determine if a spell should be considered as active in auto-repeat
    mode.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is currently in an auto-repeat state, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the spell will automatically repeat its effects based on
    the current state of the player's action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->IsAutoRepeat()) {\n    // Spell is in auto-repeat mode\n   \
      \ // Do something with auto-repeat logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine the current state of a spell. It does not directly affect the spell's
    casting or execution but rather indicates whether it is currently repeating.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a standalone check for spell activation;
    it's more useful when combined with other spell state checks to determine behavior
    during auto-repeat.
