  brief: Validates and updates the state of all active quests in the dynamic quest
    system
  description: The ValidateQuestStates method performs a comprehensive check of all
    currently active quests within the dynamic quest system to ensure their states
    are consistent with the player's current progress and game conditions. This method
    iterates through all active quests, evaluates their completion criteria, updates
    quest status flags, and handles any necessary state transitions such as marking
    quests as complete or updating quest objectives. It ensures that quest data remains
    synchronized with the player's actual progress in the game world and handles edge
    cases like quest resets or invalid states. The method is typically called during
    player login, zone changes, or periodic system maintenance to maintain quest integrity.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    // Validate all active quests on player\
      \ login\n    sDynamicQuestSystem->ValidateQuestStates();\n    // Continue with\
      \ normal login process\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic Quest State Validation
    code: "void WorldSession::Update()\n{\n    // Periodically validate quest states\
      \ every 5 minutes\n    static uint32 lastQuestValidation = 0;\n    if (getMSTime()\
      \ - lastQuestValidation > 300000)\n    {\n        sDynamicQuestSystem->ValidateQuestStates();\n\
      \        lastQuestValidation = getMSTime();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may cause performance overhead when validating large numbers
    of active quests. It should be called judiciously and ideally during low-traffic
    periods or when quest state changes are expected. The method internally handles
    locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety during validation operations.
  warnings: Calling this method during active quest progression can potentially cause
    race conditions if not properly synchronized with other quest-related operations.
    Avoid calling ValidateQuestStates while processing quest events or updates from
    the same thread context.
