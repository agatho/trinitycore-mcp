documentation:
  brief: Clears taxi flight related data and updates player state after completing
    a taxi journey.
  description: The CleanupAfterTaxiFlight method is responsible for cleaning up all
    taxi-related data and updating the player's state after they have completed a
    taxi flight. This includes removing any temporary taxi waypoints, resetting the
    player's movement flags, and ensuring that the player's position is correctly
    updated to reflect their final destination. The method is typically called automatically
    by the game engine after a player finishes using a taxi service, but can also
    be invoked manually in specific scenarios where players need to be forced out
    of taxi flight mode.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->CleanupAfterTaxiFlight();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal game mechanics and should not be called
    directly by external code unless specifically needed. It's typically invoked automatically
    when a player reaches their destination via taxi service, or when a player is
    forced to exit taxi mode.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect player positioning and
    movement issues. The method should only be called after a player has completed
    a taxi journey or when manually forcing a player out of taxi flight mode.
