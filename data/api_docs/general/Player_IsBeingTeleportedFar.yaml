  signature: bool Player::IsBeingTeleportedFar() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently being teleported to a far location.
  description: This method checks if a player is in the process of being teleported
    to a distant location, typically used during teleportation events or when the
    player is in the middle of a teleportation sequence. It returns true when the
    player's teleportation state indicates they are being moved to a faraway location,
    and false otherwise. This method is commonly used in game mechanics to prevent
    certain actions during active teleportation, such as combat or movement. The method
    is part of the Player class and is typically called during teleportation-related
    events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is being teleported to a far location, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the player's teleportation state is active and
    they are currently in the process of being moved to a distant area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsBeingTeleportedFar()) {\n    // Player is being teleported\n\
      \    // Do not allow movement or combat\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other teleportation-related
    methods to determine the state of a player's teleportation. It may be called frequently
    during teleportation events, and should be used carefully to avoid performance
    issues. The method is thread-safe and does not require any special handling.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining if a player is in combat
    or movement, as it only indicates the teleportation state. Using this method inappropriately
    can lead to incorrect game behavior during teleportation events.
