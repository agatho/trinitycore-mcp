  method: CastPetAuras
  signature: void Pet::CastPetAuras(bool current)
documentation:
  brief: Casts all pet auras for the current pet instance, optionally updating existing
    auras.
  description: The CastPetAuras method is responsible for applying or refreshing all
    auras associated with a pet in the World of Warcraft client. This method ensures
    that the pet's active buffs, debuffs, and passive effects are properly displayed
    and functioning. When called with 'current' set to true, it updates existing auras;
    when false, it may reapply them from scratch. The method is typically invoked
    during pet initialization, aura changes, or when the pet's state needs to be synchronized
    with its owner's actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->CastPetAuras(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Synchronizing Pet Auras with Owner
    code: "void OnPlayerPetUpdate(Pet* pet)\n{\n    if (pet && pet->IsAlive())\n \
      \   {\n        pet->CastPetAuras(false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles the synchronization of pet auras with the
    owner's state. It may trigger additional events or updates in the game world,
    such as visual effects or stat recalculations. The 'current' parameter determines
    whether to refresh existing aura states or reapply them entirely.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper checks may lead to unexpected behavior
    if the pet is not properly initialized or if it's not in a valid state. Ensure
    that the pet object is valid and alive before invoking this method.
