  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SetThreatThrottlingEnabled
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetThreatThrottlingEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables threat throttling for the ThreatCoordinator instance.
  description: The SetThreatThrottlingEnabled method controls whether threat throttling
    is active for the ThreatCoordinator. When enabled, this feature limits how frequently
    threat updates are processed to reduce CPU overhead and prevent excessive network
    traffic. This is particularly useful in high-density combat scenarios where many
    creatures or players generate frequent threat changes. The method does not validate
    the input parameter; it directly applies the setting to the internal state of
    the coordinator.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean value indicating whether threat throttling should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Threat Throttling
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetThreatThrottlingEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Threat Throttling
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetThreatThrottlingEnabled(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the ThreatCoordinator and affects
    how threat updates are handled in the game world. It is typically used during
    server configuration or debugging to control performance characteristics of threat
    management.
