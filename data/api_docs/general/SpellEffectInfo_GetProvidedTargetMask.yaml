documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the bitmask of target types provided by this spell
    effect.
  description: The GetProvidedTargetMask method computes a bitmask that represents
    the types of targets that this spell effect is capable of affecting. This mask
    is used internally by the TrinityCore spell system to determine which target types
    are valid for the effect and to enforce targeting restrictions. The returned value
    combines multiple target type flags using bitwise operations, allowing the system
    to efficiently check whether a given target matches the requirements of this effect.
    This method is typically called during spell validation and target resolution
    phases of spell execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 bitmask where each bit represents a specific target type. The
    bits correspond to predefined target type constants (e.g., TARGET_FLAG_UNIT, TARGET_FLAG_PLAYER,
    etc.) that define what kinds of objects this effect can target. A value of 0 indicates
    no targets are provided by this effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Targeting
    code: "SpellEffectInfo const* effect = spellInfo->GetEffect(0);\nuint32 targetMask\
      \ = effect->GetProvidedTargetMask();\nif (targetMask & TARGET_FLAG_UNIT)\n{\n\
      \    // This effect can target units\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Target Compatibility
    code: "SpellEffectInfo const* effect = spellInfo->GetEffect(0);\nuint32 providedMask\
      \ = effect->GetProvidedTargetMask();\nuint32 requiredMask = TARGET_FLAG_UNIT\
      \ | TARGET_FLAG_PLAYER;\n\n// Check if this effect can provide the required\
      \ targets\nif ((providedMask & requiredMask) == requiredMask)\n{\n    // Effect\
      \ supports all required target types\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell effect metadata and does not perform runtime
    target validation. The returned mask is computed at spell loading time based on
    effect parameters and cannot be modified during runtime. Developers should be
    aware that different bits in the mask may represent mutually exclusive or overlapping
    target types depending on the spell effect implementation.
  warnings: The returned bitmask values are defined by internal constants and may
    change between TrinityCore versions. Relying on specific bit positions rather
    than using provided macros or helper functions might lead to compatibility issues.
    Also, this method should not be used for actual target filtering during spell
    execution; it's primarily for validation and metadata purposes.
