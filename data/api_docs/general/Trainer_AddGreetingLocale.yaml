    greeting)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a localized greeting message for a trainer NPC to display to players.
  description: The AddGreetingLocale method allows developers to associate a specific
    greeting message with a trainer NPC for a given locale. This message will be displayed
    when a player interacts with the trainer and is intended for localization purposes.
    The method stores the greeting string in a locale-specific container, enabling
    different messages for different language clients. This functionality supports
    the World of Warcraft client's localization system by allowing trainers to provide
    contextually appropriate messages based on the player's selected language.
  parameters:
  - name: locale
    description: The LocaleConstant enum value specifying which language locale this
      greeting is for. Valid values include LOCALE_enUS, LOCALE_koKR, LOCALE_frFR,
      LOCALE_deDE, LOCALE_zhCN, LOCALE_zhTW, LOCALE_esES, LOCALE_esMX, LOCALE_ruRU,
      and LOCALE_ptBR.
  - name: greeting
    description: A std::string_view containing the greeting message text to be displayed
      for the specified locale. This string is stored as a reference (not copied)
      until the object is destroyed or overwritten.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding English and French Greetings
    code: "Trainer* trainer = ...;\ntrainer->AddGreetingLocale(LOCALE_enUS, \"Welcome\
      \ to my training services!\");\ntrainer->AddGreetingLocale(LOCALE_frFR, \"Bienvenue\
      \ chez mes services d'entra\xEEnement!\");"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Greeting for Multiple Locales in Loop
    code: "Trainer* trainer = ...;\nconst std::vector<std::pair<LocaleConstant, std::string_view>>\
      \ greetings = {\n    {LOCALE_enUS, \"Hello adventurer!\"},\n    {LOCALE_deDE,\
      \ \"Hallo Abenteurer!\"},\n    {LOCALE_zhCN, \"\u4F60\u597D\uFF0C\u5192\u9669\
      \u8005\uFF01\"}\n};\nfor (const auto& [locale, greeting] : greetings) {\n  \
      \  trainer->AddGreetingLocale(locale, greeting);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during NPC initialization or configuration
    in database or script loading phases. The greeting strings are stored internally
    and accessed when a player interacts with the trainer. It's recommended to use
    this method before the trainer becomes active in the game world to avoid potential
    race conditions if multiple threads might be modifying the same trainer instance.
  warnings: Ensure that locale constants match those defined in the TrinityCore localization
    system; using an invalid LocaleConstant may result in undefined behavior or the
    greeting not being displayed. Be cautious about string lifetime when passing std::string_view,
    as the underlying data must remain valid for the duration of use.
