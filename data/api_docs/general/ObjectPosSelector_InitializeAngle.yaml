documentation:
  brief: Initializes the angle selection logic for object positioning.
  description: The InitializeAngle method prepares the ObjectPosSelector class for
    calculating optimal angular positions when placing objects in the game world.
    This method typically sets up internal state variables related to angular distribution,
    such as starting angles, step sizes, and total angular ranges. It is commonly
    used before performing positional calculations for spells, abilities, or object
    placement that requires radial distribution around a central point. The method
    ensures that subsequent calls to angle-based positioning functions will work correctly
    by establishing the proper angular framework.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'ObjectPosSelector selector;

      selector.InitializeAngle();

      // Now ready for angular positioning calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any angle-based positioning operations
    to ensure proper initialization of internal state. It typically resets or sets
    default values for angular parameters such as starting angle, angular step size,
    and maximum angular range.
