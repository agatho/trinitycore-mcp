  class: SmartAI
  method: SetCombatMove
  signature: void SmartAI::SetCombatMove(bool on, bool stopMoving)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature should move during combat.
  description: The SetCombatMove method controls whether a creature will continue
    moving while engaged in combat. When enabled (on=true), the creature may move
    to maintain optimal positioning or chase targets. When disabled (on=false), the
    creature will remain stationary during combat. The stopMoving parameter can be
    used to immediately halt any ongoing movement if needed. This functionality is
    commonly used in SmartAI scripts to control NPC behavior during battles, such
    as preventing mobs from chasing players out of bounds or keeping them in place
    for scripted encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: 'on'
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether combat movement should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false).
  - name: stopMoving
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to immediately stop any current movement
      when disabling combat move. Defaults to false if not specified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Combat Movement
    code: smartAI->SetCombatMove(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Combat Movement with Immediate Stop
    code: smartAI->SetCombatMove(false, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's movement behavior during combat only.
    It does not influence movement outside of combat situations. The implementation
    relies on the SmartAI's internal state management and may interact with other
    movement-related methods like SetCombatMovement or StopMoving.
  warnings: Calling this method while the creature is in combat may cause unexpected
    behavior if not properly synchronized with the AI's current state. Ensure that
    any movement changes are coordinated with the overall combat strategy to avoid
    disrupting scripted encounters.
