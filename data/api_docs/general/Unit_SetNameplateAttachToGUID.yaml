  class: Unit
  method: SetNameplateAttachToGUID
  signature: void Unit::SetNameplateAttachToGUID(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID that a unit's nameplate should attach to.
  description: This method assigns a specific GUID to a unit's nameplate, determining
    which entity the nameplate will be attached to. It is commonly used in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore framework for managing unit targeting and nameplate behavior.
    The method allows developers to control how nameplates are linked to units, particularly
    useful when dealing with player or NPC targets. This functionality is essential
    for proper game mechanics involving unit targeting and visual representation.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity that the nameplate
      should attach to. This GUID typically represents a player, creature, or object
      in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetNameplateAttachToGUID(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with target checking
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nif (unit->GetGUID() != 0)\n{\n    unit->SetNameplateAttachToGUID(unit->GetGUID());\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other nameplate-related
    methods and requires proper initialization of the unit's nameplate system. It
    should be called before the nameplate becomes visible to ensure correct attachment.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect nameplate behavior,
    especially if the GUID is not valid or properly initialized. Avoid calling this
    method on units that are not yet fully initialized.
