  method: PlaceBuilding
  signature: void Garrison::PlaceBuilding(uint32 garrPlotInstanceId, uint32 garrBuildingId)
documentation:
  brief: Places a building instance on a specified garrison plot.
  description: The PlaceBuilding method is used to construct or place a building at
    a given plot instance within a garrison. This method typically handles the placement
    logic for structures such as buildings, towers, or other constructs that can be
    built in the garrison system. It requires both the plot instance identifier and
    the building type identifier to determine where and what to place. The method
    likely updates internal garrison data structures and may trigger visual or functional
    changes in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: garrPlotInstanceId
    description: The unique identifier of the plot instance within the garrison where
      the building will be placed. This identifies a specific location on the garrison
      map.
  - name: garrBuildingId
    description: The unique identifier of the building type to be placed. This corresponds
      to a specific building definition in the game's database, such as a Stable,
      Lumber Mill, or Mage Tower.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Place a Stable Building
    code: 'Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();

      garrison->PlaceBuilding(12345, 67890); // Place a stable at plot instance 12345
      with building ID 67890'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the garrison system's internal API and may
    be called during player interaction with the garrison UI or through game events.
    It may require that the player has sufficient resources and prerequisites to build
    the specified structure.
