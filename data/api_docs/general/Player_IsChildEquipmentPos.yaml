  method: IsChildEquipmentPos
  signature: bool Player::IsChildEquipmentPos(uint8 bag, uint8 slot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given equipment slot is a child slot of a bag.
  description: The IsChildEquipmentPos method checks if a specified equipment slot
    (represented by a uint8 value) is a child slot of a bag, meaning it's located
    within the contents of that bag rather than being directly on the player's character.
    This method is used primarily for validating equipment placement and ensuring
    proper handling of items in the game mechanics. It returns true if the slot is
    a child of the bag, false otherwise. The method is commonly used in conjunction
    with other inventory-related functions to verify item positioning within the player's
    inventory.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified slot is a child of the given bag, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the item is located inside the bag rather than on the player's
    person directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsChildEquipmentPos(0, 1)) {\n    // Handle bag slot 1\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory validation
    functions to determine if an item is properly placed within a bag. It's important
    to note that the method does not validate the actual contents of the bag, but
    rather checks whether a slot belongs to a specific bag.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters and does not perform any validation
    on the bag or slot values. Invalid inputs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results.
