  signature: const int * DB2Manager::GetFactionTeamList(uint32 faction) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of faction team IDs associated with a given faction ID.
  description: The GetFactionTeamList method returns a pointer to an array of integers
    representing the faction teams that a specific faction belongs to. This is used
    in World of Warcraft's faction system to determine groupings of factions for purposes
    such as PvP rewards, reputation tracking, and team-based gameplay mechanics. The
    returned array is typically null-terminated and contains one or more team identifiers.
    This method is part of the DB2Manager class which handles loading and accessing
    data from the game's database files (DB2 format).
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a constant integer array containing faction team IDs associated
    with the specified faction. Returns nullptr if no teams are defined for the given
    faction or if the faction ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through faction team list
    code: "const int* teamList = sDB2Manager->GetFactionTeamList(1234);\nif (teamList\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; teamList[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n      \
      \  printf(\"Faction Team ID: %d\\n\", teamList[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is managed internally by the DB2Manager and should not
    be freed by the caller. The method performs a lookup in an internal data structure,
    so repeated calls with the same faction ID will return the same pointer. This
    method assumes that faction IDs are valid and exist in the loaded DB2 files.
  warnings: Be cautious when dereferencing the returned pointer as it may be null
    if no teams are associated with the given faction. Always check for null before
    using the result. Also, ensure that the faction ID passed is valid and exists
    in the database to avoid undefined behavior.
