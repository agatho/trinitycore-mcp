documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is an empower spell, returning true if the spell
    has the empower flag.
  description: The IsEmpowerSpell method checks if a spell instance has the empower
    flag set, which indicates that the spell is designed to be used in conjunction
    with empowerment mechanics. This method is commonly used in spell handling logic
    to identify spells that can enhance or modify other spells through empowerment
    effects. It typically returns true for spells that are flagged as empowerment
    spells within the TrinityCore database or codebase, and false otherwise. The method
    is particularly useful in determining spell behavior during combat scenarios where
    empowerment effects are applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is an empower spell, false otherwise. This indicates
    that the spell has been flagged as having empowerment properties within the TrinityCore
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (spell->IsEmpowerSpell()) {\n    // Handle empowerment logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Scenario Example
    code: "Spell* spell = player->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nif (spell && spell->IsEmpowerSpell())\
      \ {\n    // Apply empowerment effects to target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method relies on internal spell flags and may
    be subject to change based on updates to the TrinityCore core. Performance considerations:
    The method is lightweight but should be used judiciously in high-frequency code
    paths such as combat calculations.'
  warnings: 'This method may not always reflect the actual game mechanics behavior,
    as some spells might have empowerment effects without being flagged as such in
    the database. Common mistake: relying on this method alone for determining spell
    effects without checking other related flags or mechanics.'
