documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupEventHandler instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GroupEventHandler class is responsible for releasing
    any memory or system resources that were allocated during the object's lifetime.
    This method ensures proper cleanup of event handlers related to group activities
    within the TrinityCore framework. It is automatically invoked when a GroupEventHandler
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor typically handles
    removal of event listeners, deallocation of internal data structures, and any
    necessary teardown operations required for maintaining system stability and preventing
    memory leaks.

  - title: Automatic destruction of GroupEventHandler
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    GroupEventHandler handler;\n    // ... use handler\
      \ ...\n} // handler's destructor automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects go out
    of scope. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless performing
    explicit object management. The cleanup performed by this destructor is essential
    for preventing resource leaks in long-running applications such as game servers.
