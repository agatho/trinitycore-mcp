  brief: Initializes and loads the vendor item database for the trade system
  description: The LoadVendorDatabase method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all vendor-related item data into memory from the game's database. This method
    typically executes during server startup or when the trade system needs to refresh
    its vendor inventory. It retrieves item templates, prices, quantities, and other
    vendor-specific properties from the database tables such as npc_vendor and related
    lookup tables. The method ensures that all vendors in the game world have their
    correct item inventories available for player interaction. This is a critical
    initialization step for the trade system's functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'TradeSystem* tradeSystem = new TradeSystem();

      tradeSystem->LoadVendorDatabase();

      // Vendor database is now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. It performs
    database queries that may impact startup time. The method assumes that the database
    connection is already established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate data entries. Ensure that no active vendor transactions
    are occurring when calling this method.
