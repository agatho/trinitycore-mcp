api:
  class: GuildIntegration
  method: WithdrawNeededItems
  signature: void GuildIntegration::WithdrawNeededItems(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Withdraws required items from the guild's bank for a specified player.
  description: The WithdrawNeededItems method is responsible for retrieving necessary
    items from the guild's bank storage and delivering them to a designated player.
    This function typically operates within the context of guild management and quest
    completion mechanics in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. It handles
    the logic of checking item availability, verifying player permissions, and updating
    inventory states accordingly. The method may be invoked during quest progression
    or when players need specific materials for crafting or other game activities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who will receive the withdrawn items. Must point to a valid player GUID
      value within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.WithdrawNeededItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the guild bank system and requires proper
    synchronization to prevent race conditions when multiple players access the bank
    simultaneously. The player parameter should be validated before use to ensure
    it refers to an active character in the game world.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player GUID pointer may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the referenced player is online and has proper guild permissions
    before calling this method. This function might not handle concurrent access properly
    if multiple threads attempt to withdraw items simultaneously.
