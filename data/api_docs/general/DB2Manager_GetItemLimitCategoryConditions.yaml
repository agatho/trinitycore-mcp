documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the conditions associated with a specified item limit category
    from the database.
  description: The GetItemLimitCategoryConditions method fetches an array of integer
    conditions linked to a given item limit category ID. This functionality is used
    in TrinityCore's DB2Manager to access data related to item restriction rules,
    such as how many items of a certain type can be equipped or carried by a player.
    The returned pointer points to an internal static array that should not be modified
    or freed by the caller. The method assumes that the category ID exists within
    the loaded DB2 files and will return NULL if no conditions are found for the given
    ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointing to an array of integers representing the conditions
    associated with the specified item limit category. Returns NULL if no conditions
    exist for the provided category ID or if the category ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through item limit category conditions
    code: "const int* conditions = sDB2Manager->GetItemLimitCategoryConditions(123);\n\
      if (conditions != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5 && conditions[i] !=\
      \ 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Condition %d: %d\\n\", i, conditions[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal DB2 data structures and relies on the database
    being properly loaded. The returned array is static and must not be modified or
    deallocated by the caller. Performance may vary depending on how many categories
    are loaded in memory.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned pointer's contents as it points to read-only
    internal data. Ensure that the categoryId parameter corresponds to a valid entry
    in the ItemLimitCategory.db2 file, otherwise the result will be NULL.
