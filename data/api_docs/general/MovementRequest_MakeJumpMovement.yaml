    priority, const int & targetPos, float speedXY, float speedZ, uint32 eventId,
    std::string reason, std::string sourceSystem)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new MovementRequest for executing a jump movement with
    specified parameters.
  description: The MakeJumpMovement method constructs a MovementRequest object designed
    to initiate a jumping motion for a player bot. It allows specifying movement priority,
    target position, horizontal and vertical speeds, an event identifier, and descriptive
    metadata. This method is typically used in AI-driven bot behavior systems where
    precise control over character movement is required. The resulting MovementRequest
    can be queued or executed by the movement manager to perform the jump action within
    the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level of this movement request, determining its placement
      in the execution queue. Higher priority movements are processed before lower
      ones.
  - name: targetPos
    description: Reference to the target position (likely a coordinate or node) where
      the jump should end. Value is passed by reference for efficiency.
  - name: speedXY
    description: Horizontal speed of the jump movement, controlling how fast the bot
      moves along the X and Y axes during the jump.
  - name: speedZ
    description: Vertical speed of the jump movement, determining how high the bot
      will ascend and descend during the jump.
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier for the event triggering this movement, useful
      for tracking or logging purposes.
  - name: reason
    description: String describing the reason for initiating this jump movement, aiding
      in debugging and system logging.
  - name: sourceSystem
    description: Identifier of the system or subsystem that initiated this movement
      request, helping with traceability.
  returns: A newly created MovementRequest object configured to execute a jump movement
    with the specified parameters. This object can be added to a movement queue or
    executed immediately.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Jump Movement Request
    code: MovementRequest request = bot->MakeJumpMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::High,
      targetPosition, 5.0f, 8.0f, 12345, "Avoid obstacle", "PathfindingSystem");
    language: cpp
  - title: Jump with Custom Speeds
    code: MovementRequest jump = MovementRequest::MakeJumpMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::Normal,
      someTargetPos, 3.5f, 6.0f, 98765, "Climb platform", "AIController");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method creates a new MovementRequest object and does not directly modify
    the bot's current state or movement queue. The actual execution depends on the
    movement manager processing the returned request. Ensure that targetPos is valid
    and reachable to prevent movement failures.
  warnings: Passing invalid or unreachable target positions may result in failed jump
    attempts or unexpected behavior. Be cautious with speed values, as extreme speeds
    can cause unrealistic movement or clipping issues.
