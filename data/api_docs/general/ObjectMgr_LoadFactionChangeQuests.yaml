documentation:
  brief: Loads faction change quest data from the database into memory for use during
    player faction transitions.
  description: The LoadFactionChangeQuests method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with quest information that is specifically designed to be triggered
    when players change their faction in World of Warcraft. This method is typically
    invoked during server startup or database reload operations to ensure that all
    faction change quests are available for processing. It reads relevant quest entries
    from the database tables, validates them, and stores them in memory for quick
    lookup during player faction transition events. The method does not return any
    value but modifies internal state within the ObjectMgr class to maintain a list
    of valid faction change quests.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeWorld() {\n    // Other initialization code...\n    sObjectMgr->LoadFactionChangeQuests();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically during server startup as part
    of the ObjectMgr initialization process. It's important to note that faction change
    quests are typically defined in the 'quest_template' table with specific flags
    or conditions indicating they should be used for faction transitions. The method
    assumes database connectivity and proper table structure.
  warnings: This method should not be called while active player sessions exist, as
    it may cause race conditions or inconsistent state if quest data is being modified
    during gameplay. It's recommended to call this only during server startup or maintenance
    windows when no players are logged in.
