  description: The IsEnabled method checks the operational status of the BotWorldSessionMgr,
    returning true if the bot system is currently enabled and functional within the
    TrinityCore environment. This method is typically used to verify that bot-related
    functionality is available before attempting to interact with or manage bot sessions.
    The check may involve verifying internal flags, configuration settings, or subsystem
    readiness. This method does not modify any state and is purely a query operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot world session manager is enabled and active; otherwise
    returns false.
