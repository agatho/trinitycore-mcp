  class: WaypointMgr
  method: DeleteNode
  signature: void WaypointMgr::DeleteNode(uint32 pathId, uint32 nodeId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific waypoint node from a defined path in the waypoint manager.
  description: The DeleteNode method removes a waypoint node identified by nodeId
    from a path specified by pathId. This function is typically used to modify or
    clean up AI movement paths dynamically during runtime. The method ensures that
    all references to the deleted node are removed, and any subsequent path traversal
    will skip the deleted node. It's important to note that this operation affects
    only the internal waypoint data structure and does not directly interact with
    database persistence unless explicitly handled by the calling code.
  parameters:
  - name: pathId
    description: Unique identifier of the path from which the node will be deleted.
      Must correspond to an existing path in the waypoint manager.
  - name: nodeId
    description: The sequential index of the node within the specified path that should
      be removed. Node indices start at 0 and must be valid for the given path.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete a waypoint node from a path
    code: WaypointMgr::instance()->DeleteNode(12345, 2);
    language: cpp
  - title: Delete last node in a path
    code: 'uint32 pathId = 67890;

      uint32 lastNodeId = WaypointMgr::instance()->GetPathSize(pathId) - 1;

      WaypointMgr::instance()->DeleteNode(pathId, lastNodeId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided pathId and nodeId are valid. Invalid
    parameters may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The deletion of nodes might
    affect path traversal logic for creatures using this path.
  warnings: Deleting a node from a path can cause unexpected movement behavior if
    not handled carefully. Ensure that any references to the deleted node are no longer
    used, especially in active creature AI routines.
