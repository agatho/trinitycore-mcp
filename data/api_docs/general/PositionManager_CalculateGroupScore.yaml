  class: PositionManager
  method: CalculateGroupScore
  signature: float PositionManager::CalculateGroupScore(const int & pos, const MovementContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a group score based on position and movement context
    for positioning logic.
  description: The CalculateGroupScore method computes a floating-point value representing
    the strategic importance or suitability of a given position within a group context.
    It takes into account both the absolute position and the current movement state
    of the group to determine how optimal that position is for the group's objectives.
    This method is typically used in AI pathfinding, positioning systems, or tactical
    decision-making logic where group coordination is required. The result can be
    used to prioritize positions during movement, selection of formation points, or
    evaluation of potential actions.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer representing the position index or identifier within a
      group's positioning system. This value typically corresponds to a specific location
      in a predefined array or set of possible positions.
  - name: context
    description: A MovementContext object containing information about the current
      movement state, including velocity, direction, target destination, and other
      relevant movement parameters that influence how the position score is calculated.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated group score. Higher values indicate
    more optimal or preferred positions based on the provided context. The exact scale
    and interpretation of this score depend on internal implementation logic and may
    vary depending on game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI positioning
    code: "float score = positionManager.CalculateGroupScore(5, movementContext);\n\
      if (score > 0.8f) {\n    // This position is highly recommended for group formation\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Evaluating multiple positions
    code: "float bestScore = -1.0f;\nint bestPosition = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < totalPositions;\
      \ ++i) {\n    float currentScore = positionManager.CalculateGroupScore(i, context);\n\
      \    if (currentScore > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = currentScore;\n  \
      \      bestPosition = i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestPosition for group movement"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve complex calculations involving distance metrics,
    direction vectors, and contextual weights. It is recommended to cache results
    when evaluating multiple positions in succession to avoid redundant computations.
    The implementation likely uses heuristics or game-specific algorithms tailored
    for TrinityCore's movement and positioning systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'pos' parameter is within valid bounds to prevent undefined
    behavior or access violations. The MovementContext must be properly initialized
    before calling this method, as invalid or missing context data may lead to incorrect
    scoring results.
