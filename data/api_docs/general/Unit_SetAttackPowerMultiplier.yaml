  class: Unit
  method: SetAttackPowerMultiplier
  signature: void Unit::SetAttackPowerMultiplier(float attackPowerMult)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the attack power multiplier for the unit, affecting damage calculations.
  description: This method modifies the attack power multiplier value for a Unit object,
    which influences how attack power is calculated and applied in combat. The multiplier
    affects the base attack power calculation and can be used to adjust combat performance
    or implement game mechanics such as buffs/debuffs. This method typically affects
    the unit's melee attack power calculations and may influence damage output in
    combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: attackPowerMult
    description: The multiplier value to set for attack power. Must be a positive
      float value representing the factor by which attack power is multiplied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetAttackPowerMultiplier(1.5f);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with combat mechanics
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetAttackPowerMultiplier(2.0f);

      // This would double the attack power calculation

      // for melee attacks in combat

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be called during initialization or when modifying combat
    attributes. It's important to note that this multiplier affects all attack power
    calculations for the unit, including melee and ranged attacks.
  warnings: Setting a negative or zero value may cause unexpected behavior in combat
    calculations. Ensure proper validation of input values before calling this method.
