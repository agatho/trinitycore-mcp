  signature: void LootCoordination::ExecuteDemocraticCoordination(Group * group, const
    LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Executes democratic loot coordination for a group and item, determining the
    winner through a voting process.
  description: The ExecuteDemocraticCoordination method handles the logic for distributing
    loot in a group setting using a democratic voting system. When an item is ready
    to be distributed, this method evaluates all eligible group members who have expressed
    interest in the item. Each member votes on whether they want the item, and the
    item is awarded to the player with the most votes. This process ensures fair distribution
    among group members when loot is not assigned via other methods like round-robin
    or free-for-all. The method requires a valid group context and an item from the
    loot system to operate correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players involved
      in the loot coordination process. Must be a valid group with members who can
      vote.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being distributed, including its ID, stack size, and other relevant
      properties for voting and distribution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Democratic Coordination Execution
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      // Assume item is populated with valid loot data

      LootCoordination::ExecuteDemocraticCoordination(group, item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all players in the group have been properly notified
    about the item and have had a chance to vote. The implementation may involve checking
    for voting eligibility, ensuring no duplicate votes, and updating the loot state
    after distribution.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing an invalid group could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, make sure that the item structure contains valid data before proceeding
    with coordination.
