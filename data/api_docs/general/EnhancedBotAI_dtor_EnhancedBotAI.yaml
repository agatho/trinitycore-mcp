  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::~EnhancedBotAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an EnhancedBotAI instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the EnhancedBotAI class is responsible for cleaning
    up all dynamically allocated memory and releasing any system resources held by
    the AI instance. This includes deallocating internal data structures, clearing
    bot-specific configurations, and ensuring proper cleanup of any active bot behaviors
    or states. The destructor is automatically invoked when an EnhancedBotAI object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, making it essential for preventing
    memory leaks in bot management systems. It ensures that all bot-related subsystems
    are properly terminated before the object is fully removed from memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'EnhancedBotAI* botAI = new EnhancedBotAI();

      // ... use the bot AI ...

      delete botAI; // Triggers ~EnhancedBotAI()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Destruction in Scope
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    EnhancedBotAI localBotAI;\n    // ... use localBotAI\
      \ ...\n} // ~EnhancedBotAI() automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It's important to ensure that all references to the bot AI are cleared before
    deletion to prevent dangling pointers. The destruction process may involve calling
    other cleanup methods internally, so developers should not assume immediate deallocation
    of resources.
  warnings: Calling the destructor manually on a stack-allocated object will result
    in undefined behavior. Never call ~EnhancedBotAI() directly unless you're implementing
    custom memory management. Improper use can lead to resource leaks or crashes if
    internal cleanup routines are not properly executed.
