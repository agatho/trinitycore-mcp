  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: GetTrapLevel
  signature: int BattlePetMgr::GetTrapLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current trap level associated with the battle pet manager.
  description: The GetTrapLevel method returns an integer value representing the trap
    level currently set within the BattlePetMgr instance. This level typically determines
    the difficulty or effectiveness of traps that can be deployed in battle pet scenarios.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only. It is commonly
    used to evaluate the strength of a player's battle pet setup or to determine whether
    certain actions are available based on trap level requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current trap level. A value of 0 typically
    indicates no trap is set, while higher values indicate increasing trap strength
    or complexity. Negative values may be used to denote special states or errors,
    though this depends on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int trapLevel = battlePetMgr->GetTrapLevel();\nif (trapLevel > 0) {\n \
      \   // Proceed with actions requiring a valid trap level\n    printf(\"Current\
      \ trap level: %d\\n\", trapLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Trap Level for Action Eligibility
    code: "BattlePetMgr* mgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();\nint level = mgr->GetTrapLevel();\n\
      if (level >= 5) {\n    // Allow advanced trap-based actions\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_ADVANCED_TRAP, true);\n} else {\n    // Notify user they need a higher\
      \ trap level\n    player->SendNotification(\"You need a higher trap level to\
      \ use this ability.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BattlePetMgr class and is intended for use in
    battle pet systems within TrinityCore. It should be called frequently during gameplay
    to ensure accurate state representation, especially when trap levels are dynamically
    adjusted by game events or player actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the BattlePetMgr instance is valid before calling this method;
    otherwise, accessing it may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally,
    some implementations might return negative values for special conditions, so always
    validate return values appropriately.
