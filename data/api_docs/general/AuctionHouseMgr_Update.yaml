  method: Update
  signature: void AuctionHouseMgr::Update()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the auction house system by processing pending auctions and cleaning
    up expired listings.
  description: The Update method in AuctionHouseMgr is responsible for maintaining
    the state of the auction house system. It processes all pending auction operations,
    including checking for expired auctions, removing them from the system, and handling
    any associated cleanup tasks such as returning items to bidders or sellers. This
    method is typically called periodically by the game loop to ensure that the auction
    house remains in a consistent state with current game time and player actions.
    The method does not take any parameters and performs its operations internally
    using internal auction data structures and timers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: AuctionHouseMgr::instance()->Update();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the game's main update loop
    at regular intervals. Developers should not call this method directly in most
    cases unless implementing custom auction house behavior or testing scenarios.
    The method may perform database operations and should be considered when evaluating
    performance impact during high-traffic periods.
