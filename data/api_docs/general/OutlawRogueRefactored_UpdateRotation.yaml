  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void OutlawRogueRefactored::UpdateRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the outlaw rogue's rotation logic based on current target and combat
    state
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for managing the core combat
    decision-making process for an outlaw rogue class. It evaluates the current target,
    available abilities, resource levels, and combat conditions to determine the optimal
    sequence of actions. This method typically integrates with the AI system to make
    real-time tactical decisions during encounters. The method operates on the internal
    state of the rogue and modifies its behavior based on game mechanics such as combo
    point generation, ability cooldowns, and target positioning. It is called regularly
    during combat to ensure the rogue maintains optimal rotation efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the current target entity that the rogue is engaging in
      combat. This parameter determines which enemy the rotation logic will prioritize
      when making tactical decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void UpdateRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target || *target <= 0) return;\n\
      \    // Logic to determine next ability based on target and rogue state\n  \
      \  // Implementation details would handle combo point usage, ability selection,\
      \ etc.\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI System
    code: "void OutlawRogueRefactored::UpdateRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || *target <= 0) return;\n    \n    // Check if we have a valid target\n \
      \   Unit* unitTarget = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*m_owner, *target);\n    if (!unitTarget\
      \ || !unitTarget->IsAlive())\n        return;\n    \n    // Execute rotation\
      \ logic based on combat state\n    // This might involve checking for stealth,\
      \ combo points, and ability readiness\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the AI update loop at regular intervals
    during combat. The target parameter should be validated to ensure it points to
    a valid entity before processing. Performance considerations include minimizing
    expensive operations within this method, as it may be called frequently during
    active combat.
  warnings: The target pointer must not be null or point to an invalid entity, as
    dereferencing such pointers will cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the target
    remains valid throughout the execution of this method, especially in multi-threaded
    contexts where the target might be removed from combat.
