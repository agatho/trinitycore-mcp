  class: Creature
  method: UpdateAllStats
  signature: bool Creature::UpdateAllStats()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all creature statistics including stats, resistances, and combat
    attributes.
  description: The UpdateAllStats method recalculates and applies all statistical
    values for a Creature object. This includes updating health, mana, armor, damage
    ranges, attack speeds, and various combat-related attributes based on the creature's
    level, class, and any active modifiers. The method ensures that all derived statistics
    are consistent with the creature's current state and configuration. It is typically
    invoked during creature initialization, level changes, or when stat-modifying
    effects are applied or removed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the statistics were successfully updated and applied; returns
    false if an error occurred during the update process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nbool success = creature->UpdateAllStats();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Stats have been updated successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Level Change
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\ncreature->SetLevel(10);\n// Update stats after\
      \ level change\nif (creature->UpdateAllStats())\n{\n    // Creature now has\
      \ updated stats for level 10\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calls other stat-related update functions and may
    trigger recalculations of dependent values such as damage, healing, and resistances.
    It is performance-sensitive and should not be called excessively during combat
    or high-frequency updates.
  warnings: Calling this method while the creature is in combat or actively engaged
    in actions may cause unexpected behavior or visual glitches. Avoid calling it
    from within combat-related event handlers unless absolutely necessary.
