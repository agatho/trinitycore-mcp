  class: GameEventMgr
  method: RunSmartAIScripts
  signature: void GameEventMgr::RunSmartAIScripts(uint16 event_id, bool activate)
documentation:
  brief: Executes SmartAI scripts associated with a specific game event.
  description: The RunSmartAIScripts method triggers the execution of all SmartAI
    scripts that are linked to a given game event. This function is typically invoked
    when a game event starts or ends, allowing for dynamic AI behavior changes based
    on event states. The method processes all creatures and game objects that have
    SmartAI scripts tied to the specified event ID, activating or deactivating their
    behaviors accordingly. It plays a crucial role in implementing timed events, seasonal
    changes, or quest-related AI modifications within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event for which SmartAI scripts
      should be executed. This ID corresponds to entries defined in the game_event
      table.
  - name: activate
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to activate (true) or deactivate
      (false) the SmartAI scripts associated with the event. When true, scripts are
      triggered; when false, they may be disabled or reset.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate SmartAI Scripts for Event
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->RunSmartAIScripts(42, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate SmartAI Scripts for Event
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->RunSmartAIScripts(101, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal event management system and SmartAI script
    processing. It is typically called from within game event start/end handlers to
    synchronize AI behavior with event states. The method does not directly modify
    database entries but rather triggers in-memory script execution.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected AI behavior or performance
    issues if too many scripts are activated simultaneously. Ensure that the event_id
    corresponds to an actual registered game event to avoid undefined behavior.
