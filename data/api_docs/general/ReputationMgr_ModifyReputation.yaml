  class: ReputationMgr
  method: ModifyReputation
  signature: bool ReputationMgr::ModifyReputation(const FactionEntry * factionEntry,
    int32 standing, bool spillOverOnly, bool noSpillover)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the reputation standing with a specified faction, optionally handling
    spillover effects.
  description: The ModifyReputation method adjusts a player's reputation level with
    a given faction. It accepts a FactionEntry pointer to identify the faction, an
    integer representing the change in standing (positive or negative), and two boolean
    flags that control how spillover is handled. The method returns true if the reputation
    was successfully modified, false otherwise. This function is typically used during
    quest completions, NPC interactions, or other game events where a player's relationship
    with a faction changes. Reputation changes can trigger various in-game effects
    such as access to faction-specific items, quests, or area restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: factionEntry
    description: Pointer to the FactionEntry structure that defines the faction whose
      reputation is being modified. Must not be null.
  - name: standing
    description: Integer value representing the change in reputation standing. Positive
      values increase reputation, negative values decrease it. The value is typically
      in increments of 100 or 1000 depending on faction thresholds.
  - name: spillOverOnly
    description: Boolean flag that determines whether to only process spillover effects
      from this reputation change. If true, the method will not directly modify the
      faction's standing but may still apply spillover to other factions.
  - name: noSpillover
    description: Boolean flag that disables all spillover behavior for this modification.
      When true, no spillover effects are applied regardless of faction settings or
      other conditions.
  returns: Returns true if the reputation was successfully modified and any associated
    effects were processed. Returns false if the modification failed due to invalid
    parameters or other internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Increase
    code: "FactionEntry* entry = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1118); // Argent Dawn\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    reputationMgr->ModifyReputation(entry, 1000, false, false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Suppressing Spillover Effects
    code: "FactionEntry* entry = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(942); // Stormwind\nif\
      \ (entry)\n{\n    reputationMgr->ModifyReputation(entry, -500, false, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts closely with the player's ReputationMgr instance and
    relies on faction definitions stored in the game database. The reputation change
    may trigger updates to the client UI and potentially unlock new content or quests
    depending on the faction thresholds. The method handles edge cases like reputation
    caps and ensures that changes are properly synchronized with the player's saved
    data.
  warnings: Passing a null factionEntry pointer will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate the faction entry before calling this method. Be cautious
    when modifying large reputation changes as they may trigger cascading effects
    through spillover systems, especially with factions that have complex relationships.
