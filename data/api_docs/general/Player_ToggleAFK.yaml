  brief: Toggles the Away From Keyboard status of the player, switching between AFK
    and non-AFK states.
  description: The ToggleAFK method allows a player to switch their current Away From
    Keyboard (AFK) status on or off. When toggled on, the player's AFK state is set
    to true, which typically causes the player to become idle and may trigger automatic
    logout after a period of time. When toggled off, the player's AFK state is set
    to false, indicating they are actively engaged in gameplay. This method is commonly
    used for managing player activity status during gameplay sessions.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ToggleAFK();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the player's AFK state flag, which affects gameplay
    mechanics such as automatic logout and idle detection. This operation should be
    performed carefully during active gameplay sessions to avoid unintended consequences.
