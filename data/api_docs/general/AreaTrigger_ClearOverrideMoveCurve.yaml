  method: ClearOverrideMoveCurve
  signature: void AreaTrigger::ClearOverrideMoveCurve()
documentation:
  brief: Removes any overridden movement curve applied to the area trigger.
  description: The ClearOverrideMoveCurve method resets the movement behavior of an
    AreaTrigger by clearing any custom movement curve that was previously set using
    SetOverrideMoveCurve. This allows the area trigger to return to its default movement
    pattern or be controlled by other systems such as scripted events or AI behaviors.
    The method does not take any parameters and has no return value. It is typically
    used when a temporary movement override needs to be removed, restoring normal
    operation of the area trigger.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing an Override Move Curve
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetMap()->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n\
      {\n    trigger->ClearOverrideMoveCurve();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on area triggers that have previously had
    a movement curve overridden. Calling it on a trigger without an override will
    have no effect but is safe to do so.
