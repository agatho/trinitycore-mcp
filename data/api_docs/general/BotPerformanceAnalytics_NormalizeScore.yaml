  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: NormalizeScore
  signature: double BotPerformanceAnalytics::NormalizeScore(double rawScore, double
    minValue, double maxValue) const
documentation:
  brief: Normalizes a raw performance score to a standardized range between 0 and
    1.
  description: The NormalizeScore method takes a raw performance metric and maps it
    from its original range to a standardized scale between 0 and 1. This is commonly
    used in bot analytics to compare performance across different metrics or time
    periods, where the input values may vary significantly in magnitude. The normalization
    uses a linear transformation based on the provided minimum and maximum values,
    ensuring that the minimum value becomes 0, the maximum becomes 1, and all other
    values are proportionally scaled between them. This method is particularly useful
    for creating consistent performance indicators in TrinityCore's bot management
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: rawScore
    description: The original performance score that needs to be normalized. This
      value should be within the range defined by minValue and maxValue.
  - name: minValue
    description: The minimum expected value in the raw score range. All scores below
      this will be mapped to 0 after normalization.
  - name: maxValue
    description: The maximum expected value in the raw score range. All scores above
      this will be mapped to 1 after normalization.
  returns: A double value representing the normalized score between 0 and 1. If rawScore
    equals minValue, returns 0; if rawScore equals maxValue, returns 1. Values in
    between are proportionally scaled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Score Normalization
    code: double normalized = analytics.NormalizeScore(75.0, 0.0, 100.0); // Returns
      0.75
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Comparison Across Metrics
    code: 'double score1 = analytics.NormalizeScore(playerKills, 0.0, 50.0);

      double score2 = analytics.NormalizeScore(accuracy, 0.0, 100.0);

      // Both scores are now comparable on a 0-1 scale'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that minValue is less than maxValue and that rawScore
    falls within this range. If rawScore is outside the [minValue, maxValue] bounds,
    the result will be outside the [0, 1] range but still mathematically correct for
    linear interpolation. The method is const and thread-safe as it only performs
    mathematical operations without modifying internal state.
  warnings: Ensure that minValue and maxValue are properly set to avoid division by
    zero or incorrect normalization when they are equal. Also, be cautious about using
    this method with scores that may have outliers, as the linear mapping can exaggerate
    differences near the extremes of the range.
