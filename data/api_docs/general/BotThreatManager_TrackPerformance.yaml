  signature: void BotThreatManager::TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds duration,
    const std::string & operation)
documentation:
  brief: Records performance metrics for bot threat management operations.
  description: The TrackPerformance method logs timing information for various threat
    management operations performed by AI bots within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method is used to monitor and analyze the efficiency of threat calculation and
    tracking routines, which are critical for maintaining realistic NPC behavior in
    World of Warcraft environments. The recorded data helps developers identify performance
    bottlenecks and optimize bot decision-making processes. The method accepts a duration
    measurement and operation identifier to categorize and store timing data for later
    analysis or reporting.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The time duration in microseconds that an operation took to complete.
      This value represents the actual execution time of the tracked operation.
  - name: operation
    description: A string identifier describing the specific threat management operation
      being tracked. This helps categorize performance data for analysis and reporting
      purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Tracking
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... some threat management operation ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::microseconds duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start);

      botThreatManager->TrackPerformance(duration, "CalculateThreat");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Multiple Operations
    code: "for (const auto& op : {\"UpdateAggro\", \"CheckTarget\", \"AdjustThreat\"\
      }) {\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n    // ...\
      \ perform operation ...\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    std::chrono::microseconds duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end\
      \ - start);\n    botThreatManager->TrackPerformance(duration, op);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in performance profiling and debugging scenarios.
    The recorded data may be stored in internal buffers or logs for later retrieval.
    It's important to note that this method does not directly affect gameplay behavior
    but rather provides diagnostic information for developers.
  warnings: The method uses high-resolution timing which can introduce minimal overhead.
    When called frequently, it may impact performance if not properly managed. Ensure
    that operation names are consistent and meaningful for effective analysis.
