  class: GroupObjective
  method: GroupObjective
  signature: void GroupObjective::GroupObjective(Type t, uint32 id, int pos, float
    radius)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a group objective with specified type, ID, position, and radius.
  description: The GroupObjective constructor initializes a group objective instance
    with the provided parameters. This method sets up essential properties for a group
    objective including its type (e.g., quest, event, or task), unique identifier,
    positional coordinates, and interaction radius. The initialization is typically
    used when creating dynamic group objectives in World of Warcraft scenarios such
    as quest markers, encounter triggers, or area-based events. The method prepares
    the objective for integration into the game's group management system where it
    can be tracked, updated, and interacted with by players within a group context.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The type of group objective, determining its behavior and category
      within the game system. Valid values are typically defined by enumeration types
      such as QUEST_OBJECTIVE, EVENT_OBJECTIVE, or TASK_OBJECTIVE.
  - name: id
    description: A unique identifier for this specific group objective instance. This
      ID is used to distinguish between different objectives and is often tied to
      database entries or internal tracking systems.
  - name: pos
    description: The positional index or coordinate within the group objective system.
      This parameter may represent a position in a sequence, a grid coordinate, or
      an index for spatial organization of objectives.
  - name: radius
    description: The interaction radius around the objective that defines the area
      within which players can interact with it. Values should be positive floats
      representing distance units in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Quest Group Objective
    code: 'GroupObjective questObj(OBJECTIVE_TYPE_QUEST, 12345, 0, 5.0f);

      // Initializes a quest objective with ID 12345 at position 0 with 5-unit radius'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating an Event Group Objective
    code: 'GroupObjective eventObj(OBJECTIVE_TYPE_EVENT, 98765, 3, 10.0f);

      // Initializes an event objective with ID 98765 at position 3 with 10-unit radius'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object instantiation and should be
    followed by additional setup routines to register the objective with the group
    system. The parameters are expected to be validated before use, especially the
    radius which must be positive. Performance considerations include avoiding frequent
    re-initialization of objectives that are already active.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values may lead to undefined behavior or visual glitches
    in the game world. Ensure that the type parameter corresponds to valid enumeration
    values; invalid types might cause runtime errors or unexpected objective behavior.
    The position parameter should not be negative if it represents an index, as this
    could lead to out-of-bounds access.
