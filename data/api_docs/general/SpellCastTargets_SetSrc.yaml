  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: SetSrc
  signature: void SpellCastTargets::SetSrc(const WorldObject & wObj)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the source location for a spell cast target to the position of the provided
    WorldObject.
  description: The SetSrc method assigns the source coordinates for a spell's targeting
    system based on the given WorldObject. This is typically used when a spell needs
    to originate from a specific object such as a player, creature, or game object.
    The method updates internal tracking of the spell's starting point which may be
    used during spell execution for effects like line-of-sight checks, area-of-effect
    calculations, or visual effects. It ensures that the spell cast system knows where
    the spell is being cast from in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: wObj
    description: A constant reference to a WorldObject that serves as the source of
      the spell cast. This object determines the position and orientation from which
      the spell will be cast.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Source from Player Object
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.SetSrc(*player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Creature as Source
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.SetSrc(*creature);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the SpellCastTargets
    object. It is typically called before initiating a spell cast to ensure proper
    targeting behavior. The WorldObject passed must remain valid for the duration
    of the spell cast, as the reference is stored internally.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or destroyed WorldObject reference can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the object remains alive and valid throughout the spell's
    execution period.
