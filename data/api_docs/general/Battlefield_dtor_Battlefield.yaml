  brief: Destroys a Battlefield instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The Battlefield destructor is responsible for cleaning up all resources
    allocated during the lifetime of a Battlefield object. This includes releasing
    memory, unregistering from subsystems, and ensuring proper cleanup of any battlefield-related
    data structures. The destructor is automatically invoked when a Battlefield object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no memory leaks occur
    and that the battlefield system remains in a consistent state after destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destruction of Battlefield Instance
    code: 'Battlefield* bf = new Battlefield();

      // ... use the battlefield ...

      delete bf; // Triggers ~Battlefield() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    is deleted. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. Battlefield objects are typically managed through
    smart pointers or automatic lifetime management in the TrinityCore framework.
