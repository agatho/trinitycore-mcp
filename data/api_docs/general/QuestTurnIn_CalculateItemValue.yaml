  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: CalculateItemValue
  signature: float QuestTurnIn::CalculateItemValue(const QuestRewardItem & reward,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the value of a quest reward item for a player bot.
  description: The CalculateItemValue method determines the relative worth of a quest
    reward item based on its properties and the player's current inventory state.
    This calculation considers factors such as item quality, vendor price, and potential
    usefulness to the bot. The method is typically used in automated quest completion
    systems where bots need to evaluate which items are most beneficial to accept
    as rewards. It helps determine whether an item should be accepted or if another
    reward option might be more valuable.
  parameters:
  - name: reward
    description: Reference to the QuestRewardItem structure containing information
      about the quest reward item including item ID, quantity, and other reward properties.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will receive
      the quest reward. This parameter is used to evaluate the bot's inventory and
      current needs.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated worth of the quest reward item.
    Higher values indicate more valuable rewards. The exact scale depends on internal
    evaluation logic but typically ranges from 0.0 (least valuable) to several hundred
    or more for high-value items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion
    code: "QuestRewardItem reward;\nreward.item = 12345;\nreward.count = 1;\nPlayer*\
      \ bot = ...; // initialized player object\nfloat value = questTurnIn->CalculateItemValue(reward,\
      \ bot);\nif (value > 100.0f) {\n    // Accept this reward as it's highly valuable\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing multiple rewards
    code: "QuestRewardItem reward1, reward2;\nreward1.item = 12345; reward1.count\
      \ = 1;\nreward2.item = 67890; reward2.count = 2;\nPlayer* bot = ...;\nfloat\
      \ value1 = questTurnIn->CalculateItemValue(reward1, bot);\nfloat value2 = questTurnIn->CalculateItemValue(reward2,\
      \ bot);\nif (value1 > value2) {\n    // Choose first reward\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Choose second reward\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal logic to assess item value based on factors
    like item level, enchantments, and the bot's current inventory capacity. It may
    also consider the bot's class, specialization, and quest completion history when
    evaluating reward worth. The implementation should be thread-safe as it's designed
    for use in automated systems.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters and may crash or produce undefined
    behavior if either parameter is null. Ensure that the QuestRewardItem structure
    contains valid data before calling this method. Be aware that the calculated values
    are relative and may vary between different bot configurations or game versions.
