  signature: float SpawnStats::GetSuccessRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the success rate percentage for creature or game object
    spawning within the TrinityCore server.
  description: The GetSuccessRate method computes the likelihood that a spawn event
    will successfully create its intended creature or game object. This value is typically
    expressed as a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 represents
    no chance of success and 1.0 indicates guaranteed success. The calculation may
    take into account various factors such as spawn conditions, server load, available
    resources, and configured spawn rules. This method is commonly used in spawn management
    systems to determine whether a given spawn entry should proceed with instantiation
    or be skipped based on its calculated probability.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the success rate of the spawn event, ranging
    from 0.0 (no chance of success) to 1.0 (guaranteed success). Values outside this
    range are not expected but may indicate misconfiguration or error in underlying
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SpawnStats stats;\nfloat rate = stats.GetSuccessRate();\nif (rate >= 0.5f)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with spawn logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spawn Logic
    code: "void HandleCreatureSpawn(Creature* creature) {\n    SpawnStats& stats =\
      \ creature->GetSpawnStats();\n    float successRate = stats.GetSuccessRate();\n\
      \    if (successRate > 0.7f) {\n        // High probability of successful spawn,\
      \ proceed normally\n        creature->SetRespawnTime(30);\n    } else if (successRate\
      \ > 0.3f) {\n        // Medium chance, delay or reduce spawn frequency\n   \
      \     creature->SetRespawnTime(60);\n    } else {\n        // Low chance, skip\
      \ or cancel spawn\n        creature->Delete();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any direct spawning operations; it only calculates
    the success rate. The actual spawn behavior depends on how this value is interpreted
    by higher-level systems such as spawn managers or AI logic. Implementation details
    may vary depending on the specific type of spawn (creature, game object) and its
    associated configuration parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the SpawnStats object has been properly initialized before
    calling GetSuccessRate, as uninitialized values could lead to unpredictable results.
    Also note that this method might be called frequently during server operation,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account if used in tight loops
    or high-frequency contexts.
