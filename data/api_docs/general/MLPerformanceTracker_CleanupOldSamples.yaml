  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::CleanupOldSamples()
documentation:
  brief: Removes outdated performance samples from the tracking system to maintain
    memory efficiency and data accuracy.
  description: The CleanupOldSamples method is responsible for removing stale or expired
    performance monitoring data from the MLPerformanceTracker. This ensures that the
    tracker does not accumulate unnecessary historical data, which could lead to memory
    bloat or inaccurate performance metrics. The method typically evaluates existing
    samples based on their age or relevance and removes those that no longer contribute
    meaningfully to performance analysis. It is generally called periodically as part
    of routine maintenance within the TrinityCore framework's performance monitoring
    subsystem.

  - title: Basic Usage in Performance Monitoring Loop
    code: "void PerformanceMonitor::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    m_performanceTracker.CleanupOldSamples();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked automatically by the system's maintenance routines
    or may be called manually during performance-critical operations to ensure optimal
    memory usage. It should not be called too frequently as it might introduce unnecessary
    overhead.
