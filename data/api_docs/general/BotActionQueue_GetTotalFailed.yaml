documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of failed bot actions in the queue
  description: The GetTotalFailed method retrieves the cumulative number of bot actions
    that have failed execution within the BotActionQueue. This counter tracks all
    unsuccessful operations performed by the bot, including but not limited to movement
    failures, spell casting errors, or target acquisition issues. The value is typically
    used for debugging, performance monitoring, and statistical analysis of bot behavior.
    This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state of the queue.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total number of failed actions in the queue
    since its initialization or last reset. Returns zero if no failures have occurred.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Bot Performance
    code: "uint64 failedCount = botQueue->GetTotalFailed();\nif (failedCount > 100)\n\
      {\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Bot has %llu failed actions\", failedCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Failure Rate Over Time
    code: 'uint64 initialFailed = botQueue->GetTotalFailed();

      // ... perform some bot actions ...

      uint64 currentFailed = botQueue->GetTotalFailed();

      float failureRate = (currentFailed - initialFailed) / static_cast<float>(totalActions);

      sLog->outString("Bot failure rate: %.2f%%", failureRate * 100);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a cumulative count and is not reset automatically. The
    counter may be incremented by various internal bot subsystems including movement,
    combat, and interaction handlers. The return value is consistent across all threads
    accessing the same queue instance.
  warnings: The returned value represents only failed actions from the current queue
    instance. If multiple queues exist for different bots or contexts, each must be
    queried separately to get complete failure statistics. This method does not distinguish
    between different types of failures, so additional filtering may be required for
    detailed analysis.
