api:
  class: GuildAchievementMgr
  method: CompletedAchievement
  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::CompletedAchievement(const AchievementEntry
    * entry, Player * referencePlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the guild achievement manager that a player has completed a specific
    achievement.
  description: The CompletedAchievement method is used to inform the GuildAchievementMgr
    about a player's completion of a particular achievement. This method typically
    updates internal tracking structures and may trigger related guild-based rewards
    or notifications. It requires both an achievement entry and a reference player
    who has earned the achievement. The method does not return any value, as its purpose
    is purely to update state within the guild achievement system.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: A pointer to the AchievementEntry structure that defines the achievement
      being completed. This must be a valid pointer to an existing achievement entry
      in the game's database.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the player who has completed
      the achievement. This player must be valid and currently active within the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Achievement Completion Notification
    code: "AchievementEntry* entry = sAchievementMgr->GetAchievement(12345);\nPlayer*\
      \ player = ...; // Get reference to player\nif (entry && player)\n{\n    guildMgr->CompletedAchievement(entry,\
      \ player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine when a player
    earns an achievement. Developers should ensure that both parameters are valid
    before calling this function to avoid crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid pointers (null or dangling) can lead
    to segmentation faults or corrupted data within the guild achievement system.
    Always validate inputs before invoking this method.
