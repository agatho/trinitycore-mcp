  class: GridInfo
  method: ResetTimeTracker
  signature: void GridInfo::ResetTimeTracker(time_t interval)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the time tracker for the grid to the specified interval.
  description: The ResetTimeTracker method initializes or resets the internal time
    tracking mechanism associated with a GridInfo object. This is typically used in
    the context of grid-based world management in TrinityCore, where grids track when
    certain events or updates should occur next. The method sets the next update time
    based on the provided interval, effectively scheduling the next processing cycle
    for the grid. It ensures that the grid's time tracking state is properly reset
    according to the specified time interval, which may be used for periodic cleanup,
    object updates, or other time-sensitive operations within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: interval
    description: The time interval (in seconds) to set as the new tracking interval
      for the grid. This value determines when the next update or processing cycle
      should occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Grid Time Tracker
    code: 'GridInfo* gridInfo = ...;

      gridInfo->ResetTimeTracker(30); // Reset to 30-second interval'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables that control when the
    grid will next be processed. It should only be called when the grid's update schedule
    needs to be adjusted, such as after significant changes in grid activity or during
    initialization.
