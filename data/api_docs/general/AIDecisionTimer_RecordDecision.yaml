  signature: void AIDecisionTimer::RecordDecision()
documentation:
  brief: Records the current AI decision timestamp for tracking and analysis purposes.
  description: The RecordDecision method logs the current time when an AI decision
    is made, typically used for performance monitoring, behavior analysis, or debugging
    AI logic within the TrinityCore framework. This method is part of the AIDecisionTimer
    class which helps track how frequently and when AI decisions are executed. It
    does not require any parameters and updates internal timing data structures to
    reflect the latest decision event.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Context
    code: "void EnemyAI::OnThink()\n{\n    // Perform AI logic\n    if (ShouldAttack())\n\
      \    {\n        AttackTarget();\n        m_decisionTimer.RecordDecision(); //\
      \ Record the decision time\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after an AI has made a decision to ensure
    accurate timing of decision-making events. It may be used in conjunction with
    other timer methods like GetLastDecisionTime() or ResetTimer(). The implementation
    likely uses high-resolution timers for precise measurement.
