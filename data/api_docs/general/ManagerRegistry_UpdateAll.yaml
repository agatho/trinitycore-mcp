  class: ManagerRegistry
  method: UpdateAll
  signature: uint32 ManagerRegistry::UpdateAll(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all registered managers with the specified time difference.
  description: The UpdateAll method iterates through all registered managers in the
    ManagerRegistry and calls their individual update methods, passing the provided
    time difference (diff) to each. This is typically used during the game loop to
    synchronize the state of various subsystems like AI, movement, or event handling
    with the current game tick. The method ensures that all managers are processed
    in a consistent order and with the same time delta for deterministic behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the total number of managers that were successfully updated during
    this call. This value can be used for debugging or performance monitoring purposes
    to verify that all expected managers have been processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update all registered managers\n\
      \    uint32 updatedCount = sManagerRegistry->UpdateAll(diff);\n    // Optional:\
      \ Log the number of updated managers\n    if (sLog->IsOutEnabled(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL))\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Updated %u managers\", updatedCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or server update
    cycle. It's important to note that the order in which managers are updated may
    affect behavior if there are dependencies between them. The diff parameter represents
    milliseconds since last update and should be consistent across all managers for
    predictable results.
