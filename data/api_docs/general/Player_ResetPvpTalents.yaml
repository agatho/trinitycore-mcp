  brief: Resets all PvP talents for the player, clearing their talent tree and allowing
    them to relearn new talents.
  description: The ResetPvpTalents method clears all PvP talents from a player's talent
    tree, effectively resetting their PvP talent specialization. This action removes
    all points invested in PvP talents and allows the player to relearn new talents
    without any restrictions. The method is typically used when a player's PvP talent
    specialization needs to be reset, such as during a character level-up or when
    switching between different PvP talent trees. It ensures that the player can start
    fresh with their PvP talent progression.

  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the player's PvP talent
    progression. It is typically invoked during character level-up or when switching
    between different PvP talent trees. The method does not affect normal talent trees,
    only PvP-specific ones.
  warnings: This method should not be called during combat or while the player is
    in a PvP zone, as it may cause unexpected behavior. Also, this method does not
    reset the player's PvP talent points; it only resets the talent tree itself.
