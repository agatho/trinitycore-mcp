  signature: Player * ChatHandler::getSelectedPlayer()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Player object of the currently selected unit in the game client.
  description: The getSelectedPlayer method retrieves the Player instance associated
    with the currently selected unit in the World of Warcraft client. This method
    is typically used within the TrinityCore server's command handler system to perform
    actions on the player that the administrator or game master has selected in their
    interface. The returned Player pointer may be null if no player unit is currently
    selected or if the selected unit is not a player character. This method relies
    on the internal state of the ChatHandler instance and the current selection context
    within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object representing the currently selected unit,
    or nullptr if no valid player is selected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Command Handler
    code: "void HandleTeleportCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    Player* target\
      \ = handler->getSelectedPlayer();\n    if (!target)\n    {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      No player selected.\");\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with teleportation\
      \ logic using target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method depends on the ChatHandler's internal selection tracking mechanism.
    It should only be called within command handler contexts where a valid player
    selection exists. The returned Player pointer is not guaranteed to remain valid
    beyond the scope of the current command execution.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a command context may return unexpected
    results or nullptr. Always check for null before dereferencing the returned pointer
    to prevent crashes.
