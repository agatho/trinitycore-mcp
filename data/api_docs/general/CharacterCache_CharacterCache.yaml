  brief: Moves a CharacterCache object, transferring its resources to another instance.
  description: The CharacterCache::CharacterCache method is a move constructor that
    transfers ownership of resources from one CharacterCache object to another. This
    operation is typically used when moving objects between scopes or containers to
    avoid expensive copy operations. The source object becomes invalid after the move
    and should not be used. In the context of TrinityCore, this method likely handles
    efficient transfer of cached character data structures, such as player information,
    inventory details, or other frequently accessed character attributes. This is
    a standard C++ move semantics implementation that optimizes resource management
    in high-frequency game systems.

  examples:
  - title: Move CharacterCache to new variable
    code: 'CharacterCache cache1;

      // ... populate cache1 with data ...

      CharacterCache cache2 = std::move(cache1); // Move constructor called

      // cache1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in container context
    code: 'std::vector<CharacterCache> caches;

      caches.emplace_back();

      CharacterCache newCache = std::move(caches.front());

      caches.clear(); // cache moved out, original is invalidated'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics for the CharacterCache class. It's
    designed to be efficient and avoid deep copying of large data structures. The
    moved-from object should not be accessed after this operation. In TrinityCore,
    this likely improves performance when managing character data caches in high-frequency
    operations like player login/logout or world updates.
  warnings: After calling this move constructor, the source CharacterCache object
    is left in a valid but unspecified state. Using it afterward will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure no other code attempts to use the moved-from object after this
    operation.
