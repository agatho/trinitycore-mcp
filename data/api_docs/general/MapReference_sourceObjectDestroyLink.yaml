  signature: void MapReference::sourceObjectDestroyLink()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the link between the referenced object and its source map in the
    TrinityCore server.
  description: The MapReference::sourceObjectDestroyLink method is responsible for
    breaking the association between a referenced object and its parent map. This
    typically occurs when an object is being removed or destroyed from a map, ensuring
    that proper cleanup and reference management happens within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method likely updates internal data structures to prevent dangling references
    and maintains consistency in the game world's object hierarchy. It is generally
    called during object destruction or removal processes to ensure proper memory
    management and prevent access to invalid objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during object cleanup
    code: "void MyGameObject::Destroy()\n{\n    // Perform cleanup operations\n  \
      \  sourceObjectDestroyLink(); // Break the map reference link\n    // Continue\
      \ with destruction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal reference management system in TrinityCore.
    It should only be called when an object is being removed from a map to prevent
    memory leaks and dangling references. The implementation likely involves updating
    internal linked list or container structures to remove the reference.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already destroyed object may lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the object is still valid before calling this method. This
    method should not be called directly by regular game logic unless you understand
    the underlying reference management system.
