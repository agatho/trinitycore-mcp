  method: GetSpiritHealerGuid
  signature: int DeathRecoveryManager::GetSpiritHealerGuid() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the spirit healer associated with the
    death recovery system.
  description: The GetSpiritHealerGuid method returns the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the spirit healer NPC that is responsible for handling player resurrection
    and related death recovery mechanics in TrinityCore. This identifier is typically
    used internally by the game engine to locate and interact with the appropriate
    spirit healer object when a player dies and needs to be resurrected. The method
    is const, indicating it does not modify any internal state of the DeathRecoveryManager
    instance. It's commonly invoked during player death processing or resurrection
    events to ensure the correct healer is referenced.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the spirit healer NPC. This value typically
    corresponds to a valid GameObject or Creature GUID within the TrinityCore world
    database, or may return 0 if no spirit healer has been initialized or assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Death Handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerDeath(Player* player)\n{\n    DeathRecoveryManager& recoveryMgr\
      \ = sObjectAccessor->GetDeathRecoveryManager();\n    int healerGuid = recoveryMgr.GetSpiritHealerGuid();\n\
      \    if (healerGuid != 0)\n    {\n        // Proceed with resurrection logic\
      \ using the healer GUID\n        sLog->outString(\"Spirit healer GUID: %d\"\
      , healerGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal death recovery system and may be called
    frequently during player death events. The returned GUID should not be used directly
    for object lookup without proper validation, as the spirit healer might not always
    be present or valid in all game contexts.
  warnings: The method returns 0 if no spirit healer is assigned, which could indicate
    either an uninitialized system or a missing spirit healer in the current zone.
    Always validate the returned GUID before using it for object operations to prevent
    potential crashes or undefined behavior.
