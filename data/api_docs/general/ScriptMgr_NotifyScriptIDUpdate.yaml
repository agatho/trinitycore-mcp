documentation:
  brief: Notifies all registered scripts of a script ID update event
  description: The NotifyScriptIDUpdate method is responsible for broadcasting a script
    ID update notification to all currently registered script handlers within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that any subsystem or module that relies
    on script identifiers remains synchronized with the current state of the scripting
    system. It typically gets invoked when script IDs are modified, reloaded, or when
    new scripts are initialized. The method does not accept any parameters and performs
    no direct return operations, serving instead as a communication mechanism between
    the core scripting manager and its registered components.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Script Reload Context
    code: "void HandleScriptReload()\n{\n    // Perform script reloading logic here\n\
      \    sScriptMgr->NotifyScriptIDUpdate();\n    // All registered scripts are\
      \ now notified of the update\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore core during
    script initialization or reload processes. It's important to understand that this
    notification does not imply a direct synchronization of data, but rather alerts
    registered scripts that an update has occurred and they should refresh their internal
    state if necessary.
