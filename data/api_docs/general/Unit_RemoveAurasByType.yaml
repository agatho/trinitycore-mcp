    bool negative, bool positive)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all auras of a specified type from the unit, optionally excluding
    a specific aura and considering caster GUID
  description: This method removes all auras of a given type from the Unit, allowing
    for fine-grained control over which auras are removed. It supports filtering by
    caster GUID, and can exclude specific auras from removal. The method is commonly
    used in game mechanics to remove buffs, debuffs, or other effects from units.
    It operates on the principle that aura types are defined by their effect, and
    can be used to remove specific types of auras based on their type (e.g., auraType
    = 1 for 'dummy' aura). The method is typically used in conjunction with other
    aura management functions to control unit behavior during combat or other game
    events.
  parameters:
  - name: auraType
    description: The type of aura to remove, defined by the aura effect type. This
      parameter determines which auras are removed from the unit.
  - name: casterGUID
    description: The GUID of the caster whose auras should be excluded from removal.
      If set to 0, no specific caster is excluded.
  - name: except
    description: An optional Aura pointer that specifies which aura should be excluded
      from removal. If null, no aura is excluded.
  - name: negative
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to remove negative auras (true)
      or not (false). This parameter controls the direction of removal.
  - name: positive
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to remove positive auras (true)
      or not (false). This parameter controls the direction of removal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic removal of all aura types
    code: Unit::RemoveAurasByType(1, 0, nullptr, true, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Removal with caster exclusion
    code: Unit::RemoveAurasByType(2, 123456789, nullptr, false, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other aura management functions
    to ensure precise control over unit behavior during combat or other game events.
    It is important to note that the method may not remove auras if they are protected
    by certain conditions, such as being immune to specific types of effects.
  warnings: The method may cause issues if used incorrectly with negative and positive
    flags set to true simultaneously, as it could lead to removal of all auras regardless
    of their type. Care must be taken when specifying the auraType parameter to avoid
    unintended removal of auras.
