documentation:
  brief: Handles a client request to move to the next seat on a vehicle.
  description: This method processes a packet sent by the client when a player attempts
    to switch to the next available seat on a vehicle they are currently riding. It
    is part of the vehicle interaction system in TrinityCore, allowing players to
    cycle through different passenger seats on vehicles such as boats, zeppelins,
    or mounts with multiple seating positions. The method validates the request and
    sends an appropriate response back to the client, potentially updating the player's
    seat position on the vehicle.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in WorldSession Context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestVehicleNextSeat(WorldPackets::Vehicle::RequestVehicleNextSeat&\
      \ requestVehicleNextSeat)\n{\n    if (!GetPlayer() || !GetPlayer()->IsInVehicle())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    Vehicle* vehicle = GetPlayer()->GetVehicle();\n    if\
      \ (!vehicle)\n        return;\n\n    // Process seat change logic here\n   \
      \ vehicle->ChangeSeat(GetPlayer(), true); // Move to next seat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the game client when a
    player presses the appropriate keybinding or UI button to switch seats. The implementation
    relies on the vehicle's internal seat management system and assumes that the player
    is already seated on a valid vehicle with multiple seats.
  warnings: Improper handling of this packet can lead to desynchronization between
    client and server, potentially causing players to become stuck in vehicles or
    lose their seat position. Ensure that all vehicle seat transitions are validated
    against the vehicle's configuration and passenger limits.
