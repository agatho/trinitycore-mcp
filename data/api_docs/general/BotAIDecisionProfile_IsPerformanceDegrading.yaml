  method: IsPerformanceDegrading
  signature: bool BotAIDecisionProfile::IsPerformanceDegrading() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot AI decision profile is currently experiencing
    performance degradation.
  description: The IsPerformanceDegrading method checks if the current AI decision
    profile for a bot is operating under conditions that indicate reduced performance.
    This typically occurs when system resources are constrained or when the AI is
    making too many decisions per second, causing potential lag or stuttering in bot
    behavior. The method evaluates internal metrics such as decision processing time,
    frame rate impact, and resource utilization to determine if degradation is occurring.
    It's used by the TrinityCore bot AI subsystem to dynamically adjust behavior and
    prevent system overload.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if performance degradation is detected in the bot AI decision
    profile, indicating that the AI is operating below optimal efficiency due to resource
    constraints or excessive processing demands. Returns false when no degradation
    is detected and the AI is functioning normally.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botAIDecisionProfile->IsPerformanceDegrading()) {\n    // Reduce bot\
      \ AI complexity or throttle decisions\n    botAIDecisionProfile->SetDecisionThrottle(0.5f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot's update cycle to monitor
    performance health. It may trigger automatic adjustments in AI behavior to maintain
    system stability. The implementation likely uses internal counters and timing
    mechanisms to detect when decision processing exceeds acceptable thresholds.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for critical AI decisions, as it may
    return false positives during high-load scenarios. Always implement fallback behaviors
    when performance degradation is detected.
