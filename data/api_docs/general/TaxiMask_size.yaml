documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of taxi nodes in the taxi mask.
  description: The TaxiMask::size() method returns the total count of taxi nodes (flight
    paths) that are marked as accessible within the taxi mask. This is typically used
    to determine how many destinations a player can fly to using their current set
    of known flight paths. The method provides a way to iterate through or check the
    number of available taxi destinations without manually counting them. In World
    of Warcraft's context, this relates to the player's known flight paths and their
    ability to travel between cities and locations via the taxi system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the number of taxi nodes (flight paths) that
    are enabled in the mask. Returns 0 if no taxi nodes are available or if the mask
    is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Available Taxi Destinations
    code: "TaxiMask mask;\n// ... populate mask with flight paths ...\nsize_t count\
      \ = mask.size();\nif (count > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Player has %zu available taxi\
      \ destinations\\n\", count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through Taxi Nodes
    code: "TaxiMask mask;\n// ... populate mask ...\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < mask.size();\
      \ ++i)\n{\n    if (mask[i]) // Assuming operator[] is available\n    {\n   \
      \     printf(\"Taxi node %zu is available\\n\", i);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely uses a bitset or similar data structure internally
    to efficiently store and count the enabled taxi nodes. The size() method should
    be a constant-time operation, making it efficient for frequent calls during gameplay
    logic.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only returns the count of enabled nodes; it
    does not provide information about which specific nodes are enabled. If you need
    to know which particular flight paths are available, you'll need to iterate through
    or check individual bits in the mask.
