documentation:
  brief: Moves a GameObjectAI object to another GameObjectAI object, transferring
    ownership of resources.
  description: The GameObjectAI move constructor transfers all resources from the
    source GameObjectAI object to the target GameObjectAI object. This is typically
    used when creating new AI instances or reassigning AI behavior to different game
    objects. The method ensures proper resource management by moving rather than copying
    internal data structures, which can improve performance. It's important to note
    that after this operation, the source GameObjectAI object should not be used as
    it will have been left in a valid but unspecified state.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Move GameObjectAI to new instance
    code: 'GameObjectAI* ai1 = new GameObjectAI(gameObject);

      GameObjectAI ai2 = std::move(*ai1);

      // ai1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // ai2 owns all resources previously owned by ai1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked during object construction or assignment
    operations. It's part of the standard C++ move semantics and ensures efficient
    resource transfer without unnecessary copying.
  warnings: After calling this constructor, the source GameObjectAI object must not
    be accessed as it will have been moved from and left in a valid but unspecified
    state.
