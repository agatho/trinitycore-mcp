  class: GameObject
  method: ModifyHealth
  signature: void GameObject::ModifyHealth(int32 change, int * attackerOrHealer, uint32
    spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the health of a GameObject by a specified amount, potentially affecting
    its current health and triggering related game mechanics.
  description: The ModifyHealth method adjusts the health of a GameObject, typically
    used for damage or healing operations. It can modify health values directly without
    requiring a specific attacker or healer, and supports spell-based modifications
    to ensure proper game mechanics handling. This method is commonly used in game
    logic implementations where GameObjects need to be updated with health changes,
    particularly during combat scenarios or when applying effects from spells.
  parameters:
  - name: change
    description: The amount by which the health should be modified, positive for healing
      and negative for damage. This value can be zero or any integer.
  - name: attackerOrHealer
    description: Pointer to an attacker or healer object that may be used in certain
      game mechanics, though not always required. Can be nullptr if no specific attacker/health
      is needed.
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID associated with the health modification, used for proper
      handling of spell-related effects and game mechanics during health changes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Health Modification Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      int32 damage = -10;

      int * attacker = nullptr;

      uint32 spellId = 12345;


      go->ModifyHealth(damage, attacker, spellId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Healing Example with Attacker
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      int32 heal = 20;

      int * healer = &player;

      uint32 spellId = 12345;


      go->ModifyHealth(heal, healer, spellId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObject's core health management system and
    may trigger various game mechanics depending on how it is used. It should be used
    carefully to avoid unintended side effects in combat or healing scenarios. The
    method does not directly handle health regeneration or damage calculation; instead,
    it modifies health based on provided parameters.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect health values and potentially
    cause game logic errors. Care must be taken when using the spellId parameter as
    it affects how health changes are processed in relation to specific spells. Using
    a null pointer for attackerOrHealer may result in missing or incorrect handling
    of game mechanics.
