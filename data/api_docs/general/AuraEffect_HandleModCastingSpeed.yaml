  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleModCastingSpeed(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the casting speed of a unit affected by an aura.
  description: The HandleModCastingSpeed method is responsible for adjusting the casting
    speed of a unit when an aura effect that modifies casting speed is applied or
    removed. This method is typically invoked during aura application or removal events,
    and it directly affects how quickly spells can be cast by the affected unit. The
    modification can either increase or decrease casting speed depending on the aura's
    properties and whether the effect is being applied or removed. This functionality
    is crucial for implementing effects such as haste buffs or slow debuffs in World
    of Warcraft-style gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura application
      context. This parameter provides information about which unit is affected and
      the specific aura instance.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation, typically indicating whether the effect is
      being applied (1) or removed (0). This value influences how the casting speed
      modification is processed.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura effect should be applied (true)
      or removed (false). When true, the casting speed is modified to increase; when
      false, it's reverted to normal speed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Casting Speed Buff
    code: "void ApplyHasteAura(Unit* target) {\n    AuraEffect* hasteAura = new AuraEffect();\n\
      \    AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication(target, target, 0);\n    hasteAura->HandleModCastingSpeed(app,\
      \ 1, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Casting Speed Debuff
    code: "void RemoveSlowAura(Unit* target) {\n    AuraEffect* slowAura = new AuraEffect();\n\
      \    AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication(target, target, 0);\n    slowAura->HandleModCastingSpeed(app,\
      \ 0, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the unit's casting speed attribute and should
    be called only during aura application or removal events to maintain consistency
    in gameplay mechanics. It is part of a larger system that handles various aura
    effects in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in inconsistent casting behavior
    for players or NPCs. Ensure that the mode and apply parameters are correctly set
    based on the aura's state to avoid unintended speed modifications.
