  class: UnitAI
  method: operator=
  signature: UnitAI & UnitAI::operator=(const UnitAI & right)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the state of one UnitAI object to another, copying all AI-related
    properties and behavior settings.
  description: The assignment operator for the UnitAI class copies all relevant AI
    state, including current target information, movement behaviors, action queues,
    and internal AI flags from the source UnitAI object to the destination object.
    This operation is essential when transferring AI control between different unit
    instances or resetting an AI's state during gameplay events such as creature respawns
    or AI mode changes. The assignment ensures that the target UnitAI maintains consistent
    behavior and context after the operation, preserving critical AI-related data
    structures and preventing potential inconsistencies in NPC behavior. No preconditions
    are required for this operation; however, it is typically used in scenarios where
    AI state needs to be duplicated or reset across unit instances.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The source UnitAI object whose state will be copied to the current
      object. This parameter must be a valid UnitAI instance and cannot be null.
  returns: A reference to the current UnitAI object after the assignment has been
    completed, allowing for chaining of assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'UnitAI* ai1 = new UnitAI();

      UnitAI* ai2 = new UnitAI();

      // Configure ai1 with some AI behavior

      ai1->SetCurrentTarget(targetUnit);

      // Assign ai1''s state to ai2

      *ai2 = *ai1;

      // Now ai2 has the same target as ai1'
    language: cpp
  - title: AI State Transfer Between Creatures
    code: 'Creature* creatureA = ...; // Some creature with AI

      Creature* creatureB = ...; // Another creature

      // Transfer AI state from creatureA to creatureB

      creatureB->GetAI() = creatureA->GetAI();

      // creatureB now has the same AI behavior as creatureA'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a deep copy of all AI-related internal data structures.
    It is important to note that this operation does not transfer ownership of any
    dynamically allocated memory or references to external objects; it only copies
    the AI state itself. The implementation assumes that both objects are in a valid
    state and that no memory management conflicts occur during the assignment.
  warnings: When using this operator, ensure that the source UnitAI object is fully
    initialized and not in an inconsistent state. If the source object contains references
    to other game entities (like targets or waypoints) that may become invalid, those
    references should be handled carefully after assignment. Also, avoid assigning
    AI objects across different types of units unless they are compatible in terms
    of AI behavior capabilities.
