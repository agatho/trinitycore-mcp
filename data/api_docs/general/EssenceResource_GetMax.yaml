  class: EssenceResource
  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 EssenceResource::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum value of the essence resource for the associated player
    or object.
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit or cap of the essence resource.
    This value typically represents the maximum amount of essence that can be stored
    or utilized by a character, pet, or game object at any given time. The returned
    value is usually static for a given character class, spec, or game state, but
    may vary based on buffs, gear, or other temporary modifiers. This method is commonly
    used in resource management systems to validate current resource values against
    their maximum limits.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum allowable amount of essence for
    this resource. This value defines the upper bound of the essence resource and
    should be used to clamp or validate current resource values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check resource limits
    code: "uint32 maxEssence = player->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_MAX_ESSENCE);\n\
      uint32 currentEssence = player->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_CURRENT_ESSENCE);\n\
      if (currentEssence > maxEssence)\n{\n    // Clamp the current essence to maximum\n\
      \    player->SetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_CURRENT_ESSENCE, maxEssence);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetMax in resource calculation
    code: 'uint32 maxResource = essenceResource->GetMax();

      uint32 currentResource = essenceResource->GetCurrent();

      float percentage = (float)currentResource / (float)maxResource * 100.0f;

      // Use percentage for UI display or logic

      printf("Essence usage: %.2f%%\n", percentage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a getter that returns a cached value
    or calculates the maximum based on character state. It's important to note that
    the maximum essence may change during gameplay due to level-ups, gear changes,
    or temporary buffs. The implementation should be thread-safe if accessed from
    multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned value is not used for direct modification of
    resource limits without proper validation. Be cautious when comparing current
    values against max values in performance-critical code paths as repeated calls
    may impact performance.
