  brief: Removes outdated or invalid health check entries from the bot's health tracking
    system
  description: The PruneHealthIssues method cleans up the internal health check data
    structure by removing any stale, expired, or otherwise invalid health issue records.
    This operation ensures that the bot's health monitoring system maintains accurate
    and relevant data, preventing accumulation of obsolete entries that could skew
    health assessments or consume unnecessary memory. The method typically runs periodically
    as part of routine maintenance within the AI health checking framework.

  - title: Basic Usage in Health Check Cycle
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_botHealthCheck.PruneHealthIssues();\n\
      \    // ... continue with health assessment ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not block the main game
    thread. It typically operates on a separate data structure that holds temporary
    health issue records, making it safe for frequent invocation during AI update
    cycles.
