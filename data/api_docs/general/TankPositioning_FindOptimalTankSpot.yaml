  class: TankPositioning
  method: FindOptimalTankSpot
  signature: int TankPositioning::FindOptimalTankSpot(Unit * target, float minDistance,
    float maxDistance)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal positioning spot for a tank unit relative
    to a target within specified distance range.
  description: The FindOptimalTankSpot method determines the best location for a tank
    unit to position itself in relation to a given target enemy. It evaluates various
    factors such as threat distribution, line of sight, and combat mechanics to identify
    an optimal spot that maximizes survivability and damage output. The method considers
    both minimum and maximum distance constraints from the target to ensure proper
    positioning. This function is typically used in AI-based tank behavior systems
    where strategic positioning is crucial for effective combat performance.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the enemy target that the
      tank needs to position relative to
  - name: minDistance
    description: Minimum distance threshold from the target unit (float value) for
      valid positioning spots
  - name: maxDistance
    description: Maximum distance threshold from the target unit (float value) for
      valid positioning spots
  returns: Integer value representing the index or identifier of the optimal tank
    spot found. Returns -1 if no suitable spot is available within the specified constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with default parameters
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nint optimalSpot = tankPositioning->FindOptimalTankSpot(target,\
      \ 5.0f, 20.0f);\nif (optimalSpot >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with movement to the\
      \ optimal spot\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic target and custom ranges
    code: "Unit* enemyTarget = ai->GetTarget();\nfloat minDist = 3.0f;\nfloat maxDist\
      \ = 15.0f;\nint spotIndex = tankPositioning->FindOptimalTankSpot(enemyTarget,\
      \ minDist, maxDist);\nif (spotIndex != -1) {\n    // Execute movement to the\
      \ calculated optimal position\n    Position optimalPos = GetTankSpotPosition(spotIndex);\n\
      \    me->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(0, optimalPos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI calculations and may consider factors like
    target threat level, terrain, and combat stance. The returned spot index should
    be validated against available positions before attempting movement. Performance
    is optimized for frequent calls but may vary based on the complexity of the environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Incorrect distance parameters (e.g., min > max) can lead to unexpected
    behavior or failure to find any valid spots.
