  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: SetEventProfile
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::SetEventProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const
    EventCoordinationProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the event coordination profile for a specified guild player.
  description: The SetEventProfile method assigns or updates an EventCoordinationProfile
    for a given player within the guild event system. This profile defines how the
    player participates in coordinated guild events, including their role, availability,
    and preferences. The method is typically used during event setup or when a player's
    participation details change. It ensures that the guild's event coordinator has
    up-to-date information about each member's capabilities and constraints for planning
    and executing guild activities.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose event profile is
      being set. Must be a valid player GUID within the guild context.
  - name: profile
    description: The EventCoordinationProfile object containing the player's event
      participation details, including role, availability, and preferences for guild
      events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'EventCoordinationProfile profile;

      profile.role = EVENT_ROLE_TANK;

      profile.availability = AVAILABILITY_AVAILABLE;

      profile.preferredEvents.push_back(EVENT_TYPE_RAID);


      guildEventCoordinator->SetEventProfile(playerGuid, profile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Player Profile with Multiple Preferences
    code: 'EventCoordinationProfile updatedProfile;

      updatedProfile.role = EVENT_ROLE_HEALER;

      updatedProfile.availability = AVAILABILITY_UNAVAILABLE;

      updatedProfile.preferredEvents = {EVENT_TYPE_DUNGEON, EVENT_TYPE_RAID};

      updatedProfile.skillLevel = 5;


      // Update the profile for a specific player

      guildEventCoordinator->SetEventProfile(123456789, updatedProfile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the provided GUID corresponds to an
    actual guild member. It is assumed that the caller has already verified the player's
    membership in the guild before calling this method. The profile data is stored
    in memory and may be persisted to database depending on the implementation of
    GuildEventCoordinator.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid playerGuid may result in undefined
    behavior or corruption of internal data structures. Ensure that all GUIDs passed
    to this method are valid and correspond to existing players in the guild context.
