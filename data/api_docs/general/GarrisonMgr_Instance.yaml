documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the GarrisonMgr class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the GarrisonMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the garrison management system exists
    throughout the application. This method is used to access the global garrison
    manager that handles all garrison-related functionality including garrison creation,
    building management, follower assignment, and resource tracking. The returned
    reference provides access to all garrison-specific operations and data structures
    within the TrinityCore server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single global instance of the GarrisonMgr class. This
    reference can be used to call other methods on the garrison manager for managing
    player garrisons.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the Garrison Manager
    code: 'GarrisonMgr& garrisonManager = GarrisonMgr::Instance();

      // Now use garrisonManager to access garrison functionality

      uint32 garrisonId = garrisonManager.GetPlayerGarrisonId(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Managing Garrison Followers
    code: "GarrisonMgr& garrisonMgr = GarrisonMgr::Instance();\nGarrisonFollower*\
      \ follower = garrisonMgr.GetFollower(followerGuid);\nif (follower)\n{\n    follower->SetAssignment(GARRISON_FOLLOWER_ASSIGNMENT_ACTIVE);\n\
      \    garrisonMgr.UpdateFollower(follower);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it returns a singleton instance that is initialized
    once during server startup. The singleton pattern ensures consistent access to
    garrison data across all parts of the server codebase without requiring multiple
    instances or complex synchronization.
