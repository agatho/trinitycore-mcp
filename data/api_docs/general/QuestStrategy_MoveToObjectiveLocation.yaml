  class: QuestStrategy
  method: MoveToObjectiveLocation
  signature: bool QuestStrategy::MoveToObjectiveLocation(BotAI * ai, const int & location)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the bot to the specified quest objective location and returns true
    if successful.
  description: The MoveToObjectiveLocation method instructs a bot AI to navigate to
    a designated quest objective location. This method is typically used within the
    context of quest completion strategies where the bot needs to travel to specific
    coordinates or waypoints associated with a quest's objectives. The method leverages
    the AI's movement capabilities and pathfinding system to reach the target location.
    It returns true if the bot successfully begins moving toward the location, and
    false if the operation fails due to invalid parameters or other issues. This method
    is part of the general quest strategy handling within TrinityCore's bot AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the bot that will move
      to the objective location.
  - name: location
    description: Integer identifier representing the quest objective location. This
      value typically corresponds to a predefined location index or waypoint ID within
      the quest's data structure.
  returns: True if the bot successfully begins movement toward the specified objective
    location, false otherwise. The method may return false if the location is invalid,
    the bot is already at the destination, or movement cannot be initiated due to
    game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest strategy
    code: "bool success = strategy->MoveToObjectiveLocation(ai, 12345);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Bot is now moving towards objective location 12345\n    ai->TellMaster(\"\
      Moving to quest objective.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a conditional quest completion check
    code: "if (questId == 67890)\n{\n    if (!strategy->MoveToObjectiveLocation(ai,\
      \ GetQuestObjectiveLocation(questId)))\n    {\n        ai->TellMaster(\"Failed\
      \ to move to objective location.\");\n        return false;\n    }\n    // Continue\
      \ with quest logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's underlying pathfinding system and may not
    immediately move the bot to the target location. The actual movement occurs asynchronously.
    Ensure that the provided location identifier corresponds to a valid quest objective
    in the current quest context.
  warnings: Using an invalid location ID may cause the method to return false without
    any error messages. Always validate the location parameter before calling this
    method, especially when dealing with dynamic quest objectives.
