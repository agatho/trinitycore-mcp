documentation:
  brief: Removes a temporary summoned creature from the world after a specified time
    delay.
  description: The UnSummon method schedules the removal of a temporary summoned creature
    (such as a pet or minion) from the game world after a given time interval. This
    method is typically used for creatures that are meant to exist only for a limited
    duration, such as summoned pets, guardians, or other temporary NPC entities. When
    called, it initiates a delayed destruction process where the creature will be
    removed from the map and its associated resources freed after the specified delay.
    The method does not immediately destroy the creature but rather sets up a timer
    that triggers the actual removal at the appropriate time.
  parameters:
  - name: msTime
    description: The time in milliseconds after which the temporary summon should
      be removed from the world. A value of 0 means immediate removal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage - Remove Summon After 5 Seconds
    code: 'Creature* pet = player->SummonCreature(12345, x, y, z, 0, TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_OR_CORPSE_DESPAWN,
      5000);

      // Later in code...

      pet->UnSummon(3000); // Remove after 3 more seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Immediate Removal of Temporary Summon
    code: "if (tempSummon)\n{\n    tempSummon->UnSummon(0); // Remove immediately\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the temporary summon system in TrinityCore and works
    in conjunction with the creature's internal timer management. The actual removal
    occurs during the next update cycle after the time has elapsed. For summoned creatures
    that are meant to persist until explicitly dismissed, this method should be called
    with a large timeout value or not at all.
  warnings: Calling UnSummon on a creature that has already been removed or is not
    a temporary summon may result in undefined behavior. Always ensure the creature
    exists and is a valid temporary summon before calling this method. Be cautious
    when using very short time delays as they might not be processed correctly if
    the delay is less than the update cycle interval.
