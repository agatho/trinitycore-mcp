  brief: Processes and applies batched objective tracking updates for the player's
    quest log
  description: The BatchTrackingUpdates method is responsible for collecting and applying
    multiple objective tracking changes in a single operation to optimize performance
    and reduce network overhead. This method typically aggregates changes made to
    quest objectives, such as progress updates or tracking state modifications, and
    applies them all at once rather than individually. It ensures that the player's
    quest log UI remains synchronized with the current state of objectives without
    causing excessive client-server communication. The method is commonly called during
    periodic update cycles or when multiple objective changes occur in quick succession.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void WorldSession::UpdateQuestTracking()\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        ObjectiveTracker* tracker = player->GetObjectiveTracker();\n\
      \        if (tracker)\n        {\n            tracker->BatchTrackingUpdates();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to ensure that
    quest tracking updates are processed efficiently. It's designed to minimize performance
    impact by batching operations rather than processing each update individually.
