documentation:
  brief: Populates a data buffer with creation values for a conversation object
  description: The BuildValuesCreate method is responsible for constructing the packet
    data required to create and display a conversation in the World of Warcraft client.
    This method prepares the necessary field values that define the conversation's
    properties, such as its type, associated NPC, and other relevant metadata. It
    is typically invoked during the initialization phase when a conversation needs
    to be sent to a player's client for rendering. The method directly manipulates
    the provided data buffer according to the internal structure expected by the TrinityCore
    protocol.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array that will be populated with the conversation's
      creation values. This buffer must be pre-allocated with sufficient space to
      hold all required field values.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags that specify various options or modes for the conversation
      creation. These flags may control visibility, interaction behavior, or other
      runtime properties of the conversation object.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing target-specific data, such
      as NPC identifiers or related object references. This parameter provides context
      about which entity the conversation is associated with.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of BuildValuesCreate
    code: 'int data[32];

      int flags = 0x01;

      int target[4] = {12345, 0, 0, 0};

      conversation->BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal packet construction system for World
    of Warcraft objects. It directly modifies memory pointed to by 'data' and should
    only be called when the conversation object is in a valid state for creation.
    The size of the data buffer must match or exceed the expected number of fields
    for proper operation.
  warnings: Improperly sized data buffers can lead to memory corruption. Ensure that
    the 'data' parameter points to a sufficiently large array. This method does not
    perform bounds checking on the target buffer, so invalid pointers may cause crashes.
