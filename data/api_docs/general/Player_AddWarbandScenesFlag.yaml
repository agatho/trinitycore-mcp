  signature: void Player::AddWarbandScenesFlag(uint32 slot, uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a warband scene flag to the specified slot in the player's warband data.
  description: This method allows players to add a specific warband scene flag to
    a designated slot within their warband data structure. The warband scenes system
    in World of Warcraft is used for tracking various in-game events and achievements
    related to player progression. This method is typically used when setting up or
    modifying warband scenes flags that are associated with specific quests, achievements,
    or gameplay mechanics. It's important to note that this method does not directly
    modify the actual scene data but rather adds a flag to the player's warband data
    structure, which can be accessed through other methods like GetWarbandScenesFlag
    or similar.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The slot within the warband data structure where the flag will be
      added. This represents the index of the scene flag being modified.
  - name: flag
    description: The specific warband scene flag value to add to the slot. This is
      typically a numeric identifier representing a particular scene or event in the
      game's warband system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->AddWarbandScenesFlag(0, 12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 flagValue = 67890;

      uint32 slotIndex = 2;

      player->AddWarbandScenesFlag(slotIndex, flagValue);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly modifies the player's
    warband data structure. The implementation likely involves updating internal data
    structures and may require synchronization with other methods that access warband
    data. Performance considerations are minimal but should be noted when dealing
    with multiple calls in rapid succession.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect warband scene tracking,
    potentially causing issues with quest completion or achievement progression. Care
    must be taken to ensure the correct slot and flag values are used, as incorrect
    parameters may result in invalid data being added to the player's warband structure.
