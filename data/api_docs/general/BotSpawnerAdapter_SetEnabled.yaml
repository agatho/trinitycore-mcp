  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void BotSpawnerAdapter::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the bot spawner functionality within the TrinityCore
    server.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the BotSpawnerAdapter is active
    and capable of spawning bots in the game world. When enabled, the adapter will
    process spawn requests and manage bot creation according to configured parameters.
    When disabled, all bot spawning activities are suspended until re-enabled. This
    method is typically used during server maintenance, configuration changes, or
    when specific gameplay conditions require temporary disabling of bot spawning.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating the desired state of the bot spawner. True
      enables bot spawning, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Bot Spawning
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter* adapter = new BotSpawnerAdapter();

      adapter->SetEnabled(true);

      // Bot spawning is now active'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bot Spawning During Maintenance
    code: "BotSpawnerAdapter* adapter = sObjectMgr->GetBotSpawnerAdapter();\nif (adapter)\n\
      {\n    adapter->SetEnabled(false);\n    // All bot spawning suspended for maintenance\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal state machine of the BotSpawnerAdapter.
    It should be called from the main game thread to ensure thread safety. The change
    takes effect immediately without requiring a server restart.
  warnings: Calling SetEnabled(false) will not terminate already spawned bots; they
    continue to exist in the world until explicitly removed or despawned by other
    means. Repeated toggling of this setting may cause unexpected behavior if not
    properly synchronized with other systems.
