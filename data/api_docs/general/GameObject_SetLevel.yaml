  class: GameObject
  method: SetLevel
  signature: void GameObject::SetLevel(uint32 level)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the level of the game object to the specified value.
  description: This method configures the level of a GameObject instance, which determines
    the difficulty and scaling of the object within the game world. The level affects
    various aspects such as the object's health, damage, and other attributes that
    are dependent on the player's level. This method is commonly used during object
    creation or modification to ensure proper game balance and progression. It should
    be called with valid level values between 1 and 80, as specified by the game's
    level range.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The level value to set for the GameObject. Must be within the valid
      range of 1-80, representing the player's level in the game.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetLevel(10);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with level validation
    code: 'uint32 level = 45;

      GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetLevel(level);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be used carefully as setting an invalid level may cause
    game balance issues or unexpected behavior. The level is typically set during
    object initialization or modification, and it's important to ensure that the level
    value aligns with the intended game mechanics.
  warnings: Setting a level outside of the valid range (1-80) can lead to incorrect
    game behavior and may result in unbalanced gameplay. Care should be taken when
    setting levels for objects that are part of dynamic content or quest rewards.
