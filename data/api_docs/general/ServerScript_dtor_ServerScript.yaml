  method: ~ServerScript
  signature: void ServerScript::~ServerScript()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ServerScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~ServerScript destructor is automatically invoked when a ServerScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any allocated memory, registered callbacks, or other resources that
    the script may have acquired during its lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's
    scripting system, this destructor plays a critical role in preventing memory leaks
    and maintaining stable server performance by releasing all script-related resources
    back to the system. The destruction process typically involves unregistering event
    handlers, cleaning up internal data structures, and ensuring no dangling pointers
    remain in the system.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction of ServerScript
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ServerScript* script = new ServerScript();\n\
      \    // ... perform operations with script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor\
      \ is automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-Allocated ServerScript Destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    ServerScript script; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... perform operations ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when\
      \ script goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that all derived classes properly implement
    their own destructors if they need custom cleanup logic, as the base ServerScript
    destructor will only handle basic resource cleanup.
