  class: Unit
  method: GetSchoolImmunityMask
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetSchoolImmunityMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the school immunity mask for the unit, indicating which damage types
    the unit is immune to.
  description: The GetSchoolImmunityMask method retrieves the bitmask representing
    the school immunities of a Unit. This bitmask defines which damage types (physical,
    holy, fire, nature, frost, shadow, arcane) the unit is immune to, allowing developers
    to determine the unit's resistance to various elemental damage types. The method
    is commonly used in game mechanics to check if a unit can be affected by specific
    damage types or spells. It returns a uint32 value where each bit corresponds to
    a different school of magic, and the value represents the combination of all immunity
    states for that unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the school immunity mask. Each bit
    in the returned value corresponds to a specific damage type (physical, holy, fire,
    nature, frost, shadow, arcane), with 1 indicating immunity and 0 indicating vulnerability.
    The bitmask can be used to determine which damage types the unit is immune to.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 immunityMask = unit->GetSchoolImmunityMask();\nif (immunityMask\
      \ & 1 << 0) // Check for physical immunity\n{\n    // Unit is immune to physical\
      \ damage\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Unit can take physical damage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other immunity-related
    methods like GetSchoolImmunityList or GetMechanicImmunityMask. The returned value
    is often used for determining whether a spell or attack can affect the unit based
    on its immunity state. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple
    getter method.
  warnings: This method does not distinguish between different types of immunity (e.g.,
    magical vs physical), so developers should be aware that the bitmask represents
    all immunity types combined, not just one specific type.
