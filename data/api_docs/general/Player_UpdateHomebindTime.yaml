api:
  class: Player
  method: UpdateHomebindTime
  signature: void Player::UpdateHomebindTime(uint32 time)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the homebind time for the player, typically used when teleporting
    to a new location or binding to a new home location.
  description: The UpdateHomebindTime method updates the timestamp associated with
    the player's homebind location. This function is typically invoked when a player
    teleports to a new area or binds their hearthstone to a different location. The
    time value passed to this method represents the current game time in milliseconds
    since the Unix epoch, which is used to track when the homebind was last updated.
    This information is crucial for maintaining accurate player location data and
    ensuring proper behavior of hearthstone functionality within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The current game time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. This
      value represents when the homebind was last updated and is used to track the
      timestamp of the player's home location.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Homebind Time After Teleport
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();

      player->UpdateHomebindTime(currentTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Homebind Time When Binding Hearthstone
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nif (player->GetMapId() != player->GetHomebindMapId())\n\
      {\n    uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\n    player->UpdateHomebindTime(currentTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core when players teleport
    or bind their hearthstone. The time parameter should represent the current game
    time to ensure accurate tracking of homebind updates. This function does not directly
    modify the player's position, but rather updates the timestamp associated with
    their home location.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a player's homebind location is
    actually being updated. Incorrect usage may lead to inconsistent hearthstone behavior
    or incorrect time tracking for homebind locations. Avoid calling this method with
    outdated timestamps as it could cause unexpected behavior in the player's homebind
    system.
