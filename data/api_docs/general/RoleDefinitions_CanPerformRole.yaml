  class: RoleDefinitions
  method: CanPerformRole
  signature: bool RoleDefinitions::CanPerformRole(uint8 classId, uint8 specId, GroupRole
    role, RoleCapability minCapability)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player class and specialization can perform a specific
    role based on minimum capability requirements.
  description: The CanPerformRole method evaluates if a given player class and specialization
    combination is capable of fulfilling a specified group role, taking into account
    the minimum required capability level. This method is used within TrinityCore's
    group management system to ensure that players are assigned roles appropriate
    for their class and spec combinations. It checks against internal role definitions
    and capability thresholds to make this determination. The method considers both
    the inherent capabilities of the class/spec pair and the minimum capability level
    required for the role.
  parameters:
  - name: classId
    description: The unique identifier of the player's class (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR
      = 1, CLASS_MAGE = 8). Valid values are defined in the TrinityCore class enumeration.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID within the class. For example, for Warriors,
      this might be SPEC_ARMS (0), SPEC_FURY (1), or SPEC_PROTECTION (2). Valid values
      depend on the class specified by classId.
  - name: role
    description: The group role to evaluate (e.g., ROLE_TANK, ROLE_HEALER, ROLE_DAMAGE).
      Defines what type of role capability is being checked.
  - name: minCapability
    description: The minimum required capability level for the role. This determines
      how strictly the role evaluation is enforced (e.g., ROLE_CAPABILITY_BASIC, ROLE_CAPABILITY_FULL).
  returns: Returns true if the specified class and specialization combination can
    perform the given role with at least the minimum required capability level; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Mage can perform Healing Role
    code: bool canHeal = RoleDefinitions::CanPerformRole(CLASS_MAGE, SPEC_ARCANE,
      ROLE_HEALER, ROLE_CAPABILITY_FULL);
    language: cpp
  - title: Verify Warrior Spec Can Perform Tank Role
    code: "if (RoleDefinitions::CanPerformRole(CLASS_WARRIOR, SPEC_PROTECTION, ROLE_TANK,\
      \ ROLE_CAPABILITY_BASIC)) {\n    // Assign tank role to player\n    player->SetGroupRole(ROLE_TANK);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal role definition tables that map class/spec
    combinations to their supported roles and capabilities. The implementation may
    cache results for performance optimization in frequently called scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the classId and specId parameters correspond to valid values
    within the TrinityCore class system, as invalid values could lead to unexpected
    behavior or assertion failures.
