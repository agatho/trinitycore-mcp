  brief: Heals the player's battle pet by a percentage of their maximum health.
  description: This method performs a battle pet healing effect that restores a specified
    percentage of the target pet's maximum health. It is typically used in spell effects
    where the healing amount is calculated based on the caster's level or other factors.
    The method operates within the context of World of Warcraft's battle pet system,
    specifically targeting the pet's health pool rather than the player's health.
    This effect is commonly found in spells that provide healing support for battle
    pets during combat.

  notes: This method is part of the Spell class and should be called within a proper
    spell context. The implementation likely involves calculations based on the pet's
    maximum health and the specified percentage, which may vary depending on the spell's
    properties.
