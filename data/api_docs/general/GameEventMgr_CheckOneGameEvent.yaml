documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific game event is currently active.
  description: The CheckOneGameEvent method determines whether a particular game event,
    identified by its entry ID, is currently active within the game world. This method
    is typically used to evaluate conditions for event-based content such as holidays,
    seasonal events, or limited-time promotions. It performs a lookup against the
    internal game event manager's active events list and returns true if the specified
    event is running, false otherwise. The method does not modify any state and is
    read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified game event (identified by entry) is currently
    active; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a holiday event is active
    code: "if (sGameEventMgr->CheckOneGameEvent(1234)) {\n    // Holiday event 1234\
      \ is currently active\n    // Enable holiday-specific content\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in conditional logic for event-based quests
    code: "if (sGameEventMgr->CheckOneGameEvent(5678)) {\n    // Quests related to\
      \ event 5678 should be available\n    sQuestMgr->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Remove quest if event is not active\n    sQuestMgr->RemoveQuest(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal game event system's state tracking. It
    should be called frequently during gameplay to ensure accurate event status checks.
    The method is thread-safe and can be safely called from multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the entry ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid
    game event in the database, as invalid IDs may result in unexpected behavior or
    silent failures.
