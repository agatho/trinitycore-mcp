  class: ObjectGUIDCheck
  method: operator()
  signature: bool ObjectGUIDCheck::operator()(int * object) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if an object GUID is valid and returns true if it passes the validation
    criteria.
  description: The ObjectGUIDCheck::operator() method performs a validation check
    on a given object's GUID. It evaluates whether the provided integer pointer points
    to a valid World of Warcraft object GUID according to TrinityCore's internal validation
    rules. This method is typically used in container filtering operations where only
    valid GUIDs should be processed. The method does not modify the input value but
    instead uses it for comparison and validation purposes. It is commonly employed
    in systems that manage object references, such as player tracking, creature management,
    or item handling within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to an integer representing a potential object GUID. This
      parameter should point to a valid memory location containing a GUID value. The
      method will check if this GUID conforms to TrinityCore's expected format and
      validity rules.
  returns: Returns true if the GUID pointed to by 'object' is valid according to TrinityCore's
    validation criteria, false otherwise. A valid GUID typically must not be zero
    and should conform to the expected object type range (player, creature, item,
    etc.).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a filter operation
    code: 'std::vector<int> guids = {12345, 0, 67890, 0};

      std::vector<int> valid_guids;

      std::copy_if(guids.begin(), guids.end(), std::back_inserter(valid_guids), ObjectGUIDCheck());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with STL algorithms for filtering
    code: "std::set<int> all_objects = {1001, 2002, 0, 3003, 0};\nObjectGUIDCheck\
      \ checker;\nall_objects.erase(std::remove_if(all_objects.begin(), all_objects.end(),\
      \ \n    [&checker](int guid) { return !checker(&guid); }), all_objects.end());"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be used as a predicate in STL algorithms or similar
    filtering operations. It assumes that the input pointer is valid and points to
    memory containing an integer value. The implementation likely checks for zero
    values, invalid object type ranges, or other internal consistency requirements
    specific to TrinityCore's GUID system.
  warnings: Ensure that the input pointer is not null before calling this method.
    Passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    this method may have performance implications when used extensively in tight loops
    or high-frequency operations.
