  method: UnregisterManager
  signature: bool ManagerRegistry::UnregisterManager(const std::string & managerId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a registered manager from the registry by its unique identifier.
  description: The UnregisterManager method removes a previously registered manager
    from the ManagerRegistry. It takes a string identifier that uniquely represents
    the manager to be removed. The method returns true if the manager was successfully
    found and removed, or false if no manager with the specified ID exists in the
    registry. This functionality is essential for managing dynamic systems within
    TrinityCore where managers may need to be unloaded or replaced during runtime.
    The operation ensures that resources associated with the manager are properly
    released and that subsequent attempts to access the manager using its ID will
    fail.
  parameters:
  - name: managerId
    description: A unique string identifier representing the manager to be unregistered.
      This should match the identifier used when registering the manager via RegisterManager.
  returns: Returns true if a manager with the specified ID was successfully found
    and removed from the registry. Returns false if no manager with the given ID exists
    in the registry, indicating that either the manager was never registered or has
    already been unregistered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unregistration
    code: "ManagerRegistry& registry = ManagerRegistry::Instance();\nbool success\
      \ = registry.UnregisterManager(\"PlayerManager\");\nif (success) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Player manager successfully unregistered.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Player manager not found in registry.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Unregistration with Error Handling
    code: "ManagerRegistry& registry = ManagerRegistry::Instance();\nstd::string managerId\
      \ = \"CreatureAIManager\";\n\n// Attempt to unregister the manager\nif (registry.UnregisterManager(managerId))\
      \ {\n    // Manager was successfully removed\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Successfully\
      \ unregistered manager: {}\", managerId);\n} else {\n    // Manager was not\
      \ found in registry\n    LOG_WARNING(\"server\", \"Attempted to unregister non-existent\
      \ manager: {}\", managerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes thread safety is handled by the caller or the underlying
    registry implementation. The manager ID must exactly match the one used during
    registration, including case sensitivity. If a manager holds references to other
    objects or resources, those should be properly cleaned up before calling this
    method.
  warnings: Calling UnregisterManager with an invalid or non-existent managerId will
    return false but will not cause any errors. Ensure that all references to the
    manager are removed before unregistering it to prevent dangling pointers or access
    violations. This method should not be called concurrently with RegisterManager
    for the same manager ID without proper synchronization.
