  signature: int MechanicAwareness::GetEnvironmentalHazards() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bitmask of environmental hazards currently affecting the MechanicAwareness
    object.
  description: The GetEnvironmentalHazards method returns an integer value representing
    a bitmask that encodes the types of environmental hazards currently active in
    the game world for the associated object. This bitmask is used by the game's mechanics
    system to determine how various abilities, spells, or behaviors should interact
    with environmental conditions such as lava, water, or other hazardous terrain.
    The returned value can be checked against predefined constants or flags to identify
    specific hazard types. This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes
    and spell targeting logic to ensure appropriate responses to environmental threats.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask where each bit represents a different type of environmental
    hazard. Common hazard types may include lava, water, fire, or other terrain-based
    dangers. The specific bit values are defined by the game's internal hazard system
    and should be interpreted using appropriate flag checking techniques.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check for Hazards
    code: "int hazards = mechanicAwareness.GetEnvironmentalHazards();\nif (hazards\
      \ & ENVIRONMENTAL_HAZARD_LAVA)\n{\n    // Handle lava hazard\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Hazard Bitmask for AI Decision Making
    code: "int hazards = mechanicAwareness.GetEnvironmentalHazards();\nif (hazards\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Avoid dangerous areas or use protective spells\n    if (hazards\
      \ & ENVIRONMENTAL_HAZARD_WATER)\n    {\n        // Switch to swimming behavior\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MechanicAwareness class which is typically used
    in AI systems and spell targeting. The returned bitmask should be interpreted
    using bitwise operations. The exact values and meanings of hazard flags are defined
    internally by TrinityCore's game mechanics system and may vary between different
    versions or custom configurations.
  warnings: The return value represents a bitmask, so direct comparison with specific
    hazard types (e.g., 'if (hazards == HAZARD_LAVA)') will not work correctly. Always
    use bitwise AND operations to check for specific hazard types. Be aware that the
    hazard system may be extended or modified in custom server configurations.
