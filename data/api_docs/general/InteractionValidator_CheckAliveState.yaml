  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CheckAliveState(::Player * bot, bool requireAlive)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is in an alive state based on the specified requirement.
  description: The CheckAliveState method evaluates whether a given player object
    is in an alive state, according to the requireAlive parameter. If requireAlive
    is true, the method returns true only if the player is alive; otherwise, it returns
    false. This validation is commonly used in AI behavior systems or interaction
    logic where certain actions should only be performed when a player is alive. The
    method internally checks the player's current health and status flags to determine
    their alive state.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose alive state is being validated.
      Must not be null.
  - name: requireAlive
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player must be alive for the
      method to return true. If true, returns true only if player is alive; if false,
      returns true if player is dead or alive.
  returns: Returns true if the player's alive state matches the requirement specified
    by requireAlive. Returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player is alive
    code: "if (validator.CheckAliveState(player, true)) {\n    // Perform actions\
      \ only if player is alive\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"You are still\
      \ alive!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the method to allow interaction regardless of player state
    code: "if (validator.CheckAliveState(player, false)) {\n    // Allow interaction\
      \ even if player is dead\n    player->AddItem(ItemTemplate, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal player state tracking and should be used carefully
    in performance-sensitive contexts. It is recommended to cache results when checking
    the same player multiple times within a short period.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null, as dereferencing
    a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. The method does not perform any
    safety checks on the input parameter.
