documentation:
  brief: Selects the best target for an AI-controlled unit based on selection criteria
    defined in the context.
  description: The SelectBestTarget method evaluates potential targets for an AI-controlled
    creature or NPC using criteria specified in the SelectionContext. It determines
    the most suitable target according to factors such as threat level, distance,
    health, and other combat-related attributes. This method is typically used by
    AI systems to make tactical decisions about which enemy to attack next. The method
    performs a comprehensive evaluation of all valid targets within range and returns
    the optimal selection result. The behavior may vary depending on the AI type and
    specific configuration settings of the unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SelectionResult object containing the selected target (or nullptr if
    no suitable target is found). The SelectionResult typically includes information
    about whether a valid target was chosen, the target's GUID, and potentially additional
    metadata about the selection process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        SelectionContext context;\n        context.range = 30.0f;\n\
      \        context.aggroOnly = true;\n        \n        SelectionResult result\
      \ = SelectBestTarget(context);\n        if (result.target && !result.target->IsDead())\
      \ {\n            AttackStart(result.target);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI decision-making loops and may be called
    frequently during combat. It's important to note that the selection process considers
    multiple factors including threat, distance, and target priority. The method assumes
    valid context parameters have been set before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that SelectionContext parameters are properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid or missing parameters can lead to unexpected behavior.
    Also, be aware that the method may return nullptr if no suitable targets are found
    within the specified criteria.
