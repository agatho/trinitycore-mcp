  class: RuneSystem
  method: available
  signature: bool RuneSystem::available() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has any available runes that can be used for abilities.
  description: The available() method determines whether the player's rune system
    has at least one rune that is ready to be consumed for casting spells or abilities.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this typically relates to Death
    Knights' rune mechanics where each rune must be recharged after use before it
    can be utilized again. This method is commonly used in spell casting logic to
    validate whether a player has sufficient runes before proceeding with ability
    execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one rune is available for use, false otherwise.
    An available rune means it has completed its cooldown period and can be consumed
    by abilities that require runes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rune Availability Check
    code: "if (player->GetRuneSystem()->available()) {\n    // Proceed with rune-consuming\
      \ ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEATH_COIL, true);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle insufficient runes case\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not\
      \ enough runes available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell validation phases before executing
    abilities that consume runes. It's important to note that this check should be
    performed in the context of a valid player object with an active rune system,
    as calling it on an invalid or uninitialized RuneSystem may result in undefined
    behavior.
