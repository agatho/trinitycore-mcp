  signature: float NPCInteractionManager::CalculateFlightPriority(uint32 nodeId) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the flight priority value for a specified node ID
    within the NPC interaction system.
  description: The CalculateFlightPriority method determines the relative priority
    of a given node ID in the context of NPC flight path interactions. This value
    is used by the AI system to prioritize which flight paths or nodes should be considered
    first when an NPC is determining its next action during flight or movement. The
    method likely evaluates factors such as distance, node importance, or player proximity
    to assign a priority score. It is typically invoked during NPC decision-making
    processes where flight path selection is required. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is purely computational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the calculated flight priority for
    the specified node ID. Higher values indicate higher priority, with the exact
    scale depending on internal game logic and node configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float priority = npcInteractionManager.CalculateFlightPriority(12345);\n\
      if (priority > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Proceed with high-priority flight path\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other NPC interaction logic
    to determine optimal flight paths. It may be called frequently during AI updates,
    so performance should be considered for large node sets. The exact algorithm for
    calculating priority is not exposed and depends on internal node data and game
    state.
