documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bot pattern associated with a specific bot GUID
  description: The GetBotPattern method retrieves the pattern string that defines
    how a specific bot should behave within the TrinityCore environment. This pattern
    typically contains configuration data or behavioral instructions for the bot,
    such as quest priorities, loot strategies, or movement patterns. The method takes
    a unique identifier (GUID) of a bot as input and returns the corresponding pattern
    string. This functionality is essential for managing bot behavior in automated
    player assistance systems within World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose pattern is to be retrieved.
      This should be a valid bot GUID that exists in the system.
  returns: Returns a std::string containing the pattern associated with the specified
    bot GUID. If no pattern exists for the given GUID, an empty string may be returned
    depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Bot Pattern by GUID
    code: "BotScheduler scheduler;\nuint32 botGuid = 12345;\nstd::string pattern =\
      \ scheduler.GetBotPattern(botGuid);\nif (!pattern.empty()) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Bot pattern: \" << pattern << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"No pattern found for bot GUID \" << botGuid << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal lookup operations using the provided
    GUID to retrieve stored bot configuration data. The implementation may cache results
    for performance optimization. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to an actual existing
    bot in the system to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID might result
    in an empty string being returned, which could be misinterpreted as a valid pattern.
    Always validate the returned pattern before using it in critical bot operations.
