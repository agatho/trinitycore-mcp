documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter is within the dead zone range of an enemy target.
  description: The IsInDeadZone method evaluates if the current hunter's position
    is inside a specific 'dead zone' area relative to an enemy target. This functionality
    is typically used in AI behavior logic to determine when the hunter should switch
    tactics, such as moving out of a dangerous proximity or initiating a different
    combat strategy. The method likely checks distance thresholds and possibly line-of-sight
    conditions to make this determination. It returns true if the hunter is within
    the defined dead zone, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter's current position is within the dead zone of
    an enemy target; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (hunter.IsInDeadZone()) {\n    // Move away from enemy\n    hunter.MoveAwayFromTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state logic
    code: "if (hunter.IsInDeadZone() && !hunter.HasAmmo()) {\n    // Switch to melee\
      \ combat or retreat\n    hunter.ExecuteMeleeStrategy();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves distance calculations and may use cached target
    information for performance. It's recommended to cache the result if the same
    check is performed multiple times per update cycle.
  warnings: Ensure that the hunter has a valid target before calling this method,
    as undefined behavior may occur if no target exists. The dead zone definition
    might vary based on enemy type or difficulty settings.
