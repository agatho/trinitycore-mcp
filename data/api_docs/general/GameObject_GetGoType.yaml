  class: GameObject
  method: GetGoType
  signature: int GameObject::GetGoType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the game object type identifier for the GameObject.
  description: The GetGoType method retrieves the specific type identifier associated
    with a GameObject instance, which determines how the game object behaves and interacts
    within the World of Warcraft environment. This value corresponds to predefined
    game object types such as doors, buttons, quest items, and others. The method
    is essential for identifying the nature of the game object and enabling proper
    handling of its interactions with players and other game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GameObject type identifier. Possible
    values include 0 (for doors), 1 (for buttons), 2 (for quest items), 3 (for spell
    focus), 4 (for areatrigger), 5 (for gameobject display), and other type identifiers
    depending on the specific game object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int objectType = gameObject->GetGoType();\nif (objectType == 0)\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle door\n}\nelse if (objectType == 1)\n{\n    // Handle button\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObject class and should be used carefully
    as it directly relates to game object behavior. It's recommended to use this method
    in conjunction with other GameObject methods like GetGoData() or GetGoInfo() for
    complete game object information.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as incorrect type identification can
    lead to improper handling of game objects, potentially causing game mechanics
    issues or crashes.
