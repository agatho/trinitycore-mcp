  brief: Checks whether the player has earned a specific achievement
  description: The HasAchieved method determines if a player has completed and earned
    a particular achievement within the game. This method is commonly used in quest
    systems, achievement tracking, and UI displays to show players their progress
    or unlock rewards. It performs a lookup against the player's achievement data
    stored in the database or in-memory cache. The method does not modify any state
    and is purely read-only. It returns true if the achievement has been earned by
    the player, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has earned the specified achievement, false
    if they have not yet earned it or if the achievement ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player Has Earned Achievement
    code: "if (player->HasAchieved(1234)) {\n    // Player has earned achievement\
      \ with ID 1234\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have earned the achievement!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Reward Based on Achievement
    code: "if (!player->HasAchieved(5678)) {\n    // Grant reward only if player hasn't\
      \ earned it yet\n    player->AddItem(ItemTemplate::GetItemTemplate(9001), 1);\n\
      \    player->SaveToDB();\n} else {\n    player->SendNotification(\"You already\
      \ have this reward.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically relies on cached data from the database and may not
    reflect real-time changes if the player's achievement state is modified outside
    of normal gameplay. Performance is generally good as it uses efficient lookup
    mechanisms, but repeated calls in tight loops should be avoided for optimal performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the achievement ID passed to this method is valid; invalid
    IDs might return false without error. This method does not validate whether the
    achievement exists in the game database, so calling it with a non-existent achievement
    ID will simply return false.
