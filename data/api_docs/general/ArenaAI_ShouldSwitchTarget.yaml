  class: ArenaAI
  method: ShouldSwitchTarget
  signature: bool ArenaAI::ShouldSwitchTarget(int * player, int * currentTarget) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the arena AI should switch to a new target based on current
    combat conditions.
  description: The ShouldSwitchTarget method evaluates the current state of an ArenaAI-controlled
    unit to decide if it should change its target. This decision is typically made
    based on factors such as target health, threat level, distance, and the AI's tactical
    preferences. The method takes two integer pointers as parameters which represent
    the potential new target and the current target respectively. It returns true
    if a target switch is recommended, false otherwise. This method is crucial for
    maintaining dynamic and strategic combat behavior in arena environments where
    optimal targeting can significantly impact performance.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the potential new target player's
      identifier or index.
  - name: currentTarget
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current target player's identifier
      or index.
  returns: Returns true if the AI should switch targets, false if it should continue
    targeting the current enemy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat logic
    code: "if (arenaAI->ShouldSwitchTarget(&newPlayerId, &currentTargetId)) {\n  \
      \  // Switch to new target\n    unit->SetTarget(newPlayerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with threat management system
    code: "int* target = &unit->GetVictim()->GetGUID();\nint* potentialTarget = nullptr;\n\
      // ... logic to determine potentialTarget ...\nif (arenaAI->ShouldSwitchTarget(potentialTarget,\
      \ target)) {\n    // Execute target switch\n    unit->AttackStop();\n    unit->Attack(potentialTarget,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making framework used in arena combat.
    It's designed to be called frequently during combat updates and should not perform
    heavy computations to avoid performance degradation. The method relies on internal
    state tracking of the AI unit, so calling it outside of proper combat context
    may yield unpredictable results.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and currentTarget pointers are valid before passing
    them to this method. Passing null or invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Additionally, since this method is part of an AI system, changes in
    its logic could significantly affect arena gameplay balance and should be tested
    thoroughly.
