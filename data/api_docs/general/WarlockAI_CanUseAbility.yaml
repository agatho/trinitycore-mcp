  class: WarlockAI
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool WarlockAI::CanUseAbility(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a warlock AI can use a specified spell ability based on
    current conditions and cooldowns.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a warlock AI character is capable
    of casting a specific spell ability at the current moment. It checks various game
    state conditions such as mana availability, cooldown status, target validity,
    and other contextual requirements that determine whether the spell can be legally
    cast. This method is typically used within the AI decision-making loop to filter
    out invalid spell choices before attempting to cast them. The method does not
    perform the actual casting but rather acts as a validation check to ensure that
    only appropriate abilities are considered for execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell can be used according to current game state and
    conditions; otherwise returns false. A return value of false typically indicates
    that the spell is on cooldown, the caster lacks sufficient mana, or the target
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (warlockAI->CanUseAbility(SPELL_SEED_OF_CORRUPTION))\n{\n    warlockAI->DoCastVictim(SPELL_SEED_OF_CORRUPTION);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Abilities Before Casting
    code: "if (warlockAI->CanUseAbility(SPELL_SHADOW_BOLT))\n{\n    warlockAI->DoCastVictim(SPELL_SHADOW_BOLT);\n\
      }\nelse if (warlockAI->CanUseAbility(SPELL_IMMOLATE))\n{\n    warlockAI->DoCastVictim(SPELL_IMMOLATE);\n\
      }\nelse if (warlockAI->CanUseAbility(SPELL_CORRUPTION))\n{\n    warlockAI->DoCastVictim(SPELL_CORRUPTION);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI logic and should be called frequently
    during the AI update cycle to ensure valid spell selection. It's important to
    note that this method does not account for pet summoning or other complex spell
    interactions; it focuses purely on basic casting viability.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value guarantees successful spell casting,
    as additional checks may be performed by the core game engine during actual execution.
    Also, calling this method without proper AI state management might lead to inconsistent
    behavior in combat decisions.
