documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the automatic repair functionality for an NPC interaction.
  description: The SetAutoRepair method configures whether an NPC will automatically
    repair the player's equipment when interacting with them. This feature is typically
    used in conjunction with NPC vendors or repair NPCs to streamline the gameplay
    experience by removing the need for manual repair actions. When enabled, the NPC
    will automatically repair items at a specified rate or cost. The method does not
    validate if the NPC actually supports repair functionality; it simply sets the
    internal flag that controls this behavior. This setting persists until explicitly
    changed by another call to SetAutoRepair.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto Repair
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* interactionMgr = player->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      interactionMgr->SetAutoRepair(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto Repair
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* interactionMgr = player->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      interactionMgr->SetAutoRepair(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags within the NPC interaction manager.
    It does not directly interact with the game server's database or save changes
    permanently to the player's data. The auto-repair feature may be overridden by
    other system settings or player preferences in certain game modes.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is called only when appropriate, as enabling auto-repair
    in inappropriate contexts (e.g., non-repair NPCs) might lead to unexpected behavior.
    Also, note that auto-repair does not account for durability loss during combat
    or other dynamic situations.
