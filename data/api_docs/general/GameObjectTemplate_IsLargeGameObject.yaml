documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the game object is classified as a large game object based
    on its template data.
  description: The IsLargeGameObject method checks if a GameObjectTemplate represents
    a large game object, which typically affects how the object is rendered, interacted
    with, or handled in the game world. This classification is usually determined
    by examining internal flags or properties defined in the game object's template
    data. Large game objects may have different collision behaviors, visual scaling,
    or interaction mechanics compared to standard-sized objects. The method returns
    true if the object is classified as large, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the game object template represents
    a large game object. Returns true if the object is considered large, false if
    it is not.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GameObject is Large
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate && goTemplate->IsLargeGameObject()) {\n    // Handle large game\
      \ object logic\n    printf(\"This is a large game object.\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle normal game object logic\n    printf(\"This is a regular game\
      \ object.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal template flags or properties that are set
    during database loading or server initialization. Developers should ensure that
    the GameObjectTemplate pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
