documentation:
  brief: Returns the title of the quest as it appears in the player's quest log
  description: The GetLogTitle method retrieves the title string that is displayed
    in the player's quest log for a specific quest. This title is typically used for
    display purposes within the game UI and represents the quest's name as seen by
    the player. The method is commonly used when implementing quest-related functionality,
    such as checking quest completion status or displaying quest information in various
    interfaces. It returns a const reference to a std::string, ensuring that modifications
    to the returned string do not affect the original quest object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to a std::string containing the quest title as
    it appears in the player's quest log. The string may be empty if the quest has
    no title or if the quest object is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Quest* quest = player->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nif (quest)\n{\n    std::string\
      \ title = quest->GetLogTitle();\n    // Use title for display purposes\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods. The returned string is typically derived from
    the quest's template data and may reflect changes made during gameplay. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this method simply retrieves stored data.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    quest methods, as the quest object must be valid for the method to return meaningful
    results. Using this method on an invalid quest object can lead to undefined behavior
    or access violations.
