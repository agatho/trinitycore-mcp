  method: RemoveGameObjectModel
  signature: void Map::RemoveGameObjectModel(const GameObjectModel & model)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a GameObjectModel from the map's spatial partitioning system.
  description: The RemoveGameObjectModel method removes a specified GameObjectModel
    instance from the Map's internal spatial data structures, typically used when
    a game object is destroyed or removed from the world. This ensures that the object
    no longer participates in collision detection, line-of-sight calculations, or
    other spatial queries. The method operates on the assumption that the provided
    model has been previously added to the map using AddGameObjectModel. It is part
    of TrinityCore's dynamic object management system and integrates with the Map's
    grid-based spatial partitioning for efficient object lookup and interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: model
    description: A constant reference to the GameObjectModel instance that should
      be removed from the map. This parameter must point to a valid GameObjectModel
      that was previously registered with the map using AddGameObjectModel.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a GameObjectModel from a Map
    code: "GameObjectModel* model = GetGameObjectModel();\nif (model)\n{\n    map->RemoveGameObjectModel(*model);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a GameObject
    is destroyed or moved out of the active map area. It's important to ensure that
    the GameObjectModel being removed was indeed added to the map previously, otherwise
    behavior may be undefined. The operation is generally fast but depends on the
    underlying spatial data structure implementation.
  warnings: Calling RemoveGameObjectModel with an invalid or unregistered GameObjectModel
    can lead to memory corruption or inconsistent state in the spatial partitioning
    system. Always verify that the model was added before attempting removal.
