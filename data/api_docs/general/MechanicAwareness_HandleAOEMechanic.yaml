  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: HandleAOEMechanic
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::HandleAOEMechanic(const AOEZone & zone, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Processes area-of-effect mechanic interactions for a bot within a specified
    zone.
  description: The HandleAOEMechanic method evaluates and applies game mechanics that
    affect players in a defined area of effect. It determines how various mechanic
    types (such as stuns, roots, or silences) interact with the bot's current state
    and abilities. The method takes an AOEZone parameter which defines the spatial
    boundaries and properties of the area, and a Player pointer representing the bot
    that may be affected by these mechanics. This function is typically used in AI
    behavior scripting to ensure proper handling of environmental effects and mechanic
    interactions during combat or movement.
  parameters:
  - name: zone
    description: The AOEZone object defining the area of effect boundaries, duration,
      and mechanic properties that will be processed for the bot.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose state and
      mechanics will be evaluated and adjusted based on the AOE zone effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: 'AOEZone zone;

      zone.center = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      zone.radius = 10.0f;

      zone.mechanicType = MECHANIC_STUN;

      MechanicAwareness awareness;

      awareness.HandleAOEMechanic(zone, playerBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AOEZone has been properly initialized with valid
    position and mechanic parameters. The bot must be in a valid state for mechanics
    to be applied (e.g., not dead or in an invalid phase). Implementation may involve
    checking current bot status, applying debuffs, or modifying movement behavior.
  warnings: Improperly configured AOEZone parameters can lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the zone's center and radius are valid before calling
    this method. The bot pointer should not be null or point to an invalid player
    object.
