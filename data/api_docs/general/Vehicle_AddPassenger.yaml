  method: AddPassenger
  signature: void Vehicle::AddPassenger(WorldObject * param0, const int & param1)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a passenger to the vehicle at the specified seat index.
  description: The AddPassenger method is used to assign a WorldObject (typically
    a player or creature) as a passenger to a vehicle. It places the passenger on
    a specific seat within the vehicle's seating arrangement. The method ensures proper
    linking between the passenger and vehicle, updating relevant data structures such
    as passenger lists and seat assignments. This functionality is crucial for implementing
    vehicle-based gameplay mechanics in World of Warcraft, including mounts, siege
    vehicles, and other rideable entities. The method does not validate whether the
    seat index is valid or if the passenger can legally occupy that seat; it simply
    assigns the passenger to the given seat.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject (player or creature) that will be added
      as a passenger to the vehicle.
  - name: param1
    description: Reference to an integer representing the seat index where the passenger
      will be placed. Seat indices are typically zero-based and correspond to predefined
      seating positions within the vehicle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Passenger Addition
    code: 'Vehicle* myVehicle = ...;

      Player* player = ...;

      myVehicle->AddPassenger(player, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Passengers to Different Seats
    code: 'Vehicle* vehicle = ...;

      Player* p1 = ...;

      Player* p2 = ...;

      vehicle->AddPassenger(p1, 0);

      vehicle->AddPassenger(p2, 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the seat index or passenger
    type. It assumes that the caller has already verified that the seat is available
    and the passenger can be seated there. The actual vehicle behavior (e.g., animation,
    movement) depends on how the vehicle is implemented in the server code.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper checks may result in invalid seat assignments
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure the seat index is valid for the given vehicle type
    before invoking this method. Also, be cautious about adding passengers to vehicles
    that are currently moving or in combat, as it might cause synchronization issues.
