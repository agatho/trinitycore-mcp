documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GatheringNode object with default values and prepares it
    for use in the game world.
  description: The GatheringNode constructor initializes a new gathering node instance,
    setting up its internal state and preparing it for integration into the TrinityCore
    world system. This method is responsible for initializing member variables to
    their default states, establishing base properties such as position, type, and
    visibility flags, and ensuring that the node is properly registered with the game's
    object management systems. The constructor typically performs essential setup
    tasks required for the node to function correctly within the game world, including
    setting up necessary data structures and linking it to appropriate subsystems
    like the grid manager or object registry. It does not perform any complex operations
    or interact with other objects directly; its primary purpose is to ensure the
    object is in a valid initial state before being used by other systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GatheringNode Creation
    code: 'GatheringNode* node = new GatheringNode();

      // The node is now initialized and ready for use in the world'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple GatheringNodes
    code: "std::vector<GatheringNode*> nodes;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n  \
      \  nodes.push_back(new GatheringNode());\n}\n// All nodes are properly initialized\
      \ and can be added to the world\n// using appropriate WorldObject management\
      \ methods"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating new gathering nodes, such as ore veins, herb plants, or other resource
    nodes. Developers should not directly instantiate GatheringNode objects unless
    implementing custom node types or extending existing functionality. The constructor
    does not handle world registration or positioning; these are handled separately
    through other methods like SetPosition() and AddToWorld().
  warnings: Direct instantiation of GatheringNode objects is generally discouraged
    for standard gameplay elements, as the framework provides proper factory methods
    and object managers for creating gathering nodes. Improper use of this constructor
    without proper setup may lead to undefined behavior or crashes in the game world
    system.
