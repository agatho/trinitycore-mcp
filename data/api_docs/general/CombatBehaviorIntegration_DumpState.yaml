  brief: Dumps the current combat behavior state to the log for debugging purposes
  description: The DumpState method outputs the internal state of the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    class to the system log. This method is primarily used for debugging and development
    to inspect the current combat behavior configuration, active states, and any relevant
    flags or parameters that govern how the AI behaves during combat encounters. It
    typically logs information such as current target, behavior mode, cooldowns, and
    other internal state variables without modifying them. The method is usually called
    during development or when troubleshooting AI behavior issues in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment.

    code: 'CombatBehaviorIntegration* combatBehavior = ...;

      combatBehavior->DumpState();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for development and debugging only. It may produce
    verbose output to the log and should not be called in performance-critical code
    paths. The exact format of the dumped information depends on the implementation
    details of the CombatBehaviorIntegration class.
