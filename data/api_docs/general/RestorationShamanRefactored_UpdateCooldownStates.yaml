documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all abilities and spells used by the restoration
    shaman.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking system for a restoration shaman class. This method
    iterates through all applicable abilities, spells, and talents that have cooldowns,
    and updates their remaining time based on the current game time. It ensures that
    abilities are properly marked as available or on cooldown, which affects gameplay
    mechanics such as spell casting restrictions, ability usage timing, and resource
    management. The method is typically called during periodic updates or when specific
    events occur that might affect cooldown states, such as completing a cast or receiving
    a buff/debuff.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    restorationShaman.UpdateCooldownStates();\n\
      \    // ... continue with rest of loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Spell Cast
    code: "void OnSpellCast(Spell* spell)\n{\n    // ... handle spell logic ...\n\
      \    restorationShaman.UpdateCooldownStates();\n    // Ensure cooldowns are\
      \ updated after casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's internal cooldown system
    and may be called automatically by the core game loop. Developers should ensure
    this method is not called excessively to avoid performance degradation, especially
    in high-frequency update scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method at inappropriate times (e.g., during spell casting
    or while processing other state changes) could lead to inconsistent cooldown states
    or unexpected behavior. This method should be invoked only when the game state
    allows for proper cooldown updates.
