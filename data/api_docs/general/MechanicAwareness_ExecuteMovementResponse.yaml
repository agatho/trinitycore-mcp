  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: ExecuteMovementResponse
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::ExecuteMovementResponse(Player * bot, const int
    & safePos, MechanicUrgency urgency)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a movement response for a bot player based on safety position and
    urgency level.
  description: The ExecuteMovementResponse method determines and initiates appropriate
    movement behavior for a bot player within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates
    the provided safe position and urgency level to decide whether the bot should
    move toward safety, avoid danger, or maintain current position. This method is
    typically invoked during AI decision-making processes when the bot needs to respond
    dynamically to environmental hazards or combat situations. The method considers
    factors such as the bot's current location, the defined safe zone, and the severity
    of the mechanical threat to determine the most suitable movement action.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the movement response. Must not be null.
  - name: safePos
    description: Integer value indicating the safe position or zone index where the
      bot should move. Negative values may indicate danger zones, while positive values
      typically represent safe areas.
  - name: urgency
    description: MechanicUrgency enum value that defines how quickly the bot must
      respond to the movement situation. Higher urgency levels may trigger more aggressive
      or immediate movement actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Response Execution
    code: 'MechanicAwareness awareness;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      int safeZone = 5;

      MechanicUrgency urgencyLevel = MechanicUrgency::HIGH;

      awareness.ExecuteMovementResponse(myBot, safeZone, urgencyLevel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Movement Based on Urgency
    code: "if (isInDanger)\n{\n    MechanicAwareness awareness;\n    awareness.ExecuteMovementResponse(bot,\
      \ safePosition, MechanicUrgency::CRITICAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI subsystem and relies on internal state
    tracking of the player's position and environmental data. It assumes that the
    bot has been properly initialized with valid movement capabilities and that the
    safePos parameter corresponds to a known location within the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null bot pointer will result in undefined behavior
    or crash. Ensure that all parameters are validated before invocation, especially
    the urgency enum which may have specific constraints depending on the implementation.
