documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the InstanceEventBus class for handling in-instance
    events.
  description: The InstanceEventBus constructor initializes the event bus system used
    within World of Warcraft instances to manage and dispatch various in-game events
    such as boss encounters, object interactions, and instance-specific triggers.
    This class serves as a central hub for coordinating events between different subsystems
    within an instance, ensuring proper synchronization and communication. The initialization
    process sets up internal data structures required for event handling and prepares
    the system to receive and process event notifications from various game components.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new InstanceEventBus instance
    code: 'InstanceEventBus* eventBus = new InstanceEventBus();

      // The event bus is now ready to handle instance events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when initializing an instance's event
    handling system. It does not perform any operations that would typically require
    thread safety considerations since it's part of the instance initialization process.
