  class: MoveToPositionAction
  method: IsPossible
  signature: bool MoveToPositionAction::IsPossible(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot can execute a move-to-position action based on
    current AI state and conditions.
  description: The IsPossible method evaluates if the MoveToPositionAction is currently
    feasible for execution. It checks various preconditions such as whether the bot
    has a valid target position, if movement is allowed in the current context, and
    if the AI system is in a state where this action can be performed. This method
    is typically called before attempting to execute the move action to avoid unnecessary
    processing or potential errors. The evaluation considers factors like the bot's
    current movement state, whether it's engaged in combat, and if there are any environmental
    constraints that would prevent movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the move-to-position action can be executed under current
    conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage check
    code: "if (action.IsPossible(ai)) {\n    // Proceed with executing the move-to-position\
      \ action\n    action.Execute(ai);\n} else {\n    // Handle case where movement\
      \ is not possible\n    ai->TellError(\"Cannot move to position at this time\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during AI decision-making cycles
    to ensure that actions are only queued when they're actually executable. The implementation
    may cache certain conditions for performance reasons, but it's designed to re-evaluate
    state changes in real-time.
  warnings: Do not assume that a positive return value guarantees successful execution
    of the action; additional checks or error handling may still be required after
    calling IsPossible().
