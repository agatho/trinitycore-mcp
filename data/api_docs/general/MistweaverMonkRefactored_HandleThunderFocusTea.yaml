  signature: bool MistweaverMonkRefactored::HandleThunderFocusTea(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Thunder Focus Tea buff to the specified group member
  description: The HandleThunderFocusTea method is responsible for applying the Thunder
    Focus Tea ability to a designated group member within the Mistweaver Monk's gameplay
    mechanics. This ability enhances the monk's healing capabilities by increasing
    the effectiveness of their next healing spell. The method validates that the target
    is within range and meets the necessary conditions for the buff to be applied.
    It also handles the cooldown management and resource cost associated with using
    this ability. The implementation ensures proper synchronization with the game's
    combat system and maintains the integrity of the monk's rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group member should receive
      the Thunder Focus Tea buff. Valid values are typically 0-24 representing individual
      players in a group, or -1 for self-targeting.
  returns: Returns true if the Thunder Focus Tea buff was successfully applied to
    the target, false otherwise. The method returns false when the target is invalid,
    out of range, already affected by the buff, or when insufficient resources are
    available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for self-targeting
    code: "if (mistweaver->HandleThunderFocusTea(-1)) {\n    // Thunder Focus Tea\
      \ applied successfully to self\n    SendChatMessage(\"Thunder Focus Tea applied!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying to a specific group member
    code: "uint8 targetGroupIndex = 3; // Target player at index 3 in the group\n\
      if (mistweaver->HandleThunderFocusTea(targetGroupIndex)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ applied Thunder Focus Tea to group member\n    SendChatMessage(\"Applied Thunder\
      \ Focus Tea to player 3\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to apply the buff\n   \
      \ SendChatMessage(\"Failed to apply Thunder Focus Tea\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally checks for existing Thunder Focus Tea buffs on the
    target and prevents stacking. It also validates that the player has sufficient
    mana and meets all prerequisites before applying the buff. The implementation
    uses TrinityCore's built-in cooldown handling system to manage the ability's cooldown
    period.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group index (outside the valid range
    of 0-24 or -1) may result in undefined behavior or failed application. Always
    validate the target before calling this method in high-performance scenarios to
    avoid unnecessary computations.
