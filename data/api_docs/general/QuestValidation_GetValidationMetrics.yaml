documentation:
  brief: Retrieves validation metrics for quest data integrity checks
  description: The GetValidationMetrics method returns a structured set of validation
    metrics that provide detailed information about the state and integrity of quest
    data within the TrinityCore system. These metrics typically include counts of
    valid, invalid, or pending quests, as well as performance-related statistics such
    as processing times or memory usage during validation operations. This method
    is primarily used for monitoring, debugging, and ensuring that quest systems are
    functioning correctly within the game environment. The returned ValidationMetrics
    object encapsulates all relevant statistical data without modifying any internal
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ValidationMetrics object containing structured data about quest validation
    status, including counts of various quest states (valid, invalid, pending), processing
    times, and other diagnostic information useful for system monitoring and debugging
    purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'QuestValidation validator;

      ValidationMetrics metrics = validator.GetValidationMetrics();

      std::cout << "Valid quests: " << metrics.validCount << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during system maintenance or diagnostic routines.
    It does not perform any validation operations itself but rather returns pre-computed
    metrics from the last validation cycle. The returned object should be treated
    as read-only and is intended for informational purposes only.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for real-time quest state changes, as it reflects
    cached metrics from previous validation cycles. Frequent calls may impact performance
    if the underlying validation system has not been optimized for such access patterns.
