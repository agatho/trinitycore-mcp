documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new AI instance for a class-based bot.
  description: The CreateClassAI method is responsible for instantiating and setting
    up a new AI component tailored for a specific class-based bot within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method typically allocates memory for the AI structure, initializes
    its internal state, and configures it according to the bot's class-specific behaviors
    and capabilities. It serves as the primary entry point for generating AI functionality
    for player-controlled or NPC bots that follow class-based templates. The method
    may also perform necessary setup operations such as registering event handlers,
    initializing behavior trees, or assigning default actions based on the bot's class
    type.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot identifier or handle.
      This parameter is expected to be a valid reference to a bot instance that will
      be used to initialize the AI component.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid input parameters,
    memory allocation failures, or unsupported bot classes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint result = factory->CreateClassAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // AI created successfully\n    printf(\"AI initialized for bot\
      \ %d\\n\", botId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to create\
      \ AI for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided bot identifier is valid and corresponds
    to an existing bot instance in the system. The AI creation process may involve
    memory allocation and initialization overhead, so repeated calls should be considered
    carefully for performance impact. It's recommended to check the return value before
    proceeding with further operations involving the created AI.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or invalid bot identifier to this method can result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid
    and initialized bot object before calling CreateClassAI. Additionally, this method
    should not be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization
    mechanisms.
