  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: EnablePatternRecognition
  signature: void InterruptAwareness::EnablePatternRecognition(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables pattern recognition functionality within the interrupt
    awareness system.
  description: The EnablePatternRecognition method controls whether the interrupt
    awareness system actively monitors and identifies specific interrupt patterns
    from player actions or game events. This feature is typically used in AI-driven
    systems to detect when a target's behavior follows predictable sequences that
    may indicate an impending interrupt or ability usage. When enabled, the system
    begins tracking relevant data points such as timing, sequence of actions, and
    state changes. The method does not require any specific preconditions but should
    be called before attempting to utilize pattern recognition features. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other interrupt awareness methods to configure the behavior
    of automated response systems.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean value that determines whether pattern recognition is activated
      (true) or deactivated (false). When true, the system begins monitoring for interrupt
      patterns; when false, it stops tracking and clears existing pattern data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      awareness.EnablePatternRecognition(true); // Enable pattern recognition

      // ... perform game logic that uses the pattern recognition system

      awareness.EnablePatternRecognition(false); // Disable when no longer needed'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Pattern Recognition
    code: "InterruptAwareness awareness;\nif (player->HasAura(SPELL_INTERRUPT_AURA))\
      \ {\n    awareness.EnablePatternRecognition(true);\n} else {\n    awareness.EnablePatternRecognition(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI modules where interrupt detection is
    crucial for tactical decision making. The system may internally queue or buffer
    pattern data while disabled, and reprocessing may be required upon re-enabling.
    Consider performance implications if this method is called frequently during active
    gameplay.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly with alternating values may cause unnecessary
    overhead in the underlying pattern recognition engine. Ensure that pattern recognition
    is only enabled when actively needed to avoid resource waste.
