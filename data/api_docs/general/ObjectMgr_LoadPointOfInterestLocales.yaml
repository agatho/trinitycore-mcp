  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadPointOfInterestLocales()
documentation:
  brief: Loads localized point of interest data from the database into memory for
    use in the game world.
  description: The LoadPointOfInterestLocales method retrieves all localized names
    and descriptions for points of interest (POIs) stored in the database and loads
    them into memory. This allows the game to display appropriate text based on the
    player's locale. The method is typically called during server startup or database
    reload operations to ensure that all POI data is available for client requests.
    It processes entries from the `locales_points_of_interest` table, which contains
    localized versions of point of interest names and descriptions for different languages.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadPointOfInterestLocales();\n    // Continue with\
      \ other initialization...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's database loading sequence and should
    only be called after the database connection is established. It modifies internal
    data structures used for localization, so concurrent access during execution may
    cause issues if not properly synchronized.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are actively using POIs might lead to
    inconsistent display of localized text until the operation completes. Ensure that
    it's called during a maintenance window or server downtime.
