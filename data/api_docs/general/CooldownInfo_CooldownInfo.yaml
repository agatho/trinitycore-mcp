  signature: void CooldownInfo::CooldownInfo(uint32 spell, uint32 cd, bool gcd)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a cooldown info entry with spell ID, cooldown duration, and GCD
    flag
  description: The CooldownInfo constructor method initializes a cooldown information
    structure for a specific spell. It sets up the internal state with the provided
    spell identifier, cooldown time in milliseconds, and a boolean flag indicating
    whether the spell is subject to Global Cooldown (GCD) restrictions. This method
    is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to manage spell cooldowns and
    ensure proper timing of abilities. The initialization process ensures that spell
    cooldowns are correctly tracked and enforced according to game mechanics and player
    actions.
  parameters:
  - name: spell
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the spell being initialized. This corresponds
      to the Spell.dbc entry ID in the game database.
  - name: cd
    description: The cooldown duration in milliseconds for the specified spell. This
      value determines how long the spell must wait before it can be cast again.
  - name: gcd
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the spell is subject to Global Cooldown
      (GCD). If true, the spell will be affected by the player's GCD and cannot be
      cast immediately after another GCD spell.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CooldownInfo Initialization
    code: 'CooldownInfo info(12345, 1000, true);

      // Initializes a cooldown for spell ID 12345 with 1 second cooldown and GCD
      restriction'
    language: cpp
  - title: Non-GCD Spell Cooldown
    code: 'CooldownInfo info(67890, 3000, false);

      // Initializes a cooldown for spell ID 67890 with 3 second cooldown and no GCD
      restriction'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal cooldown management system in TrinityCore.
    The spell ID must correspond to an existing spell entry in the database, otherwise
    the behavior is undefined. The cooldown duration should be specified in milliseconds
    as per TrinityCore's time handling conventions.
  warnings: Incorrect spell IDs or invalid cooldown values may lead to unexpected
    behavior in spell casting mechanics. Ensure that GCD flags are set correctly based
    on the spell's properties and game rules. This method does not perform validation
    of input parameters, so callers should ensure valid inputs before invocation.
