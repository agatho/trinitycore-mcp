  signature: void GroupEventBus::LogEvent(const GroupEvent & event, const std::string
    & action) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a group event with associated action string to the event bus.
  description: The LogEvent method records a GroupEvent along with an action description
    into the group event bus system. This functionality is typically used for tracking
    and monitoring group-related activities within the TrinityCore framework, such
    as player joins, leaves, or other group state changes. The method does not return
    any value and operates as a void function. It is designed to be called from within
    the game logic where group events need to be tracked for debugging, analytics,
    or in-game event handling purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The GroupEvent object representing the specific group event that
      occurred. This parameter contains all relevant data about the event such as
      event type, group ID, and affected players.
  - name: action
    description: A string describing the action associated with the event. This can
      be used to provide context or additional metadata about what triggered the event,
      such as 'player_joined' or 'leader_changed'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupEvent groupEvent;

      // ... populate groupEvent with data ...

      GroupEventBus::Instance()->LogEvent(groupEvent, "player_joined");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Leader Change Event
    code: 'GroupEvent event;

      event.type = GroupEventType::LEADER_CHANGED;

      event.groupId = 12345;

      event.playerGuid = 67890;

      GroupEventBus::Instance()->LogEvent(event, "leader_changed");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the GroupEventBus singleton
    instance. The event logging mechanism may be disabled or configured based on server
    settings or debug flags. Ensure that the GroupEvent object passed to this method
    is properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the GroupEventBus
    system may result in undefined behavior. Also, excessive use of this logging function
    can impact performance if not managed carefully.
