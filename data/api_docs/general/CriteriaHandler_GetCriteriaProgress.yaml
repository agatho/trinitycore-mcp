  method: GetCriteriaProgress
  signature: CriteriaProgress * CriteriaHandler::GetCriteriaProgress(const Criteria
    * entry)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the progress data for a specified criteria entry.
  description: The GetCriteriaProgress method fetches the current progress information
    associated with a given criteria entry. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    achievement and criterion tracking systems to determine how close a player is
    to completing a specific objective. The method returns a pointer to a CriteriaProgress
    object which contains data such as the progress count, completion status, and
    timestamps. It is typically called during achievement evaluation or when displaying
    progress to players in the UI.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a CriteriaProgress object representing the current progress
    for the specified criteria entry. Returns nullptr if no progress data exists for
    the given criteria or if the criteria entry is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CriteriaProgress* progress = handler->GetCriteriaProgress(criteriaEntry);\n\
      if (progress)\n{\n    // Use progress data\n    uint32 currentCount = progress->Counter;\n\
      \    bool isComplete = progress->Completed;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Progress Before Achievement Update
    code: "CriteriaProgress* progress = handler->GetCriteriaProgress(criteria);\n\
      if (!progress)\n{\n    // Initialize new progress\n    progress = new CriteriaProgress();\n\
      \    // Add to internal tracking\n}\nelse if (progress->Counter < criteria->RequiredAmount)\n\
      {\n    progress->Counter++;\n    // Update UI or check for completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal achievement system and should only be
    called during appropriate game events or when processing player data. The returned
    pointer is managed internally and should not be deleted by the caller. Progress
    tracking is typically handled automatically by the core system, but this method
    allows for direct access to progress state.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned CriteriaProgress object directly unless you
    understand the internal locking mechanisms. Accessing progress data outside of
    proper game event contexts may lead to inconsistent or stale data. Always check
    for nullptr return values before using the result.
