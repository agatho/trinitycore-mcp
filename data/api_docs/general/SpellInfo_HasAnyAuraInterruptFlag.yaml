  class: SpellInfo
  method: HasAnyAuraInterruptFlag
  signature: bool SpellInfo::HasAnyAuraInterruptFlag() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell has any aura interrupt flags set.
  description: This method checks if a spell's information contains any aura interrupt
    flags, which define conditions under which a spell's aura can be interrupted.
    The method returns true if any interrupt flag is present, indicating that the
    spell's aura can be interrupted by certain game mechanics such as damage, movement,
    or other events. This functionality is crucial for understanding spell behavior
    and determining when a spell's aura might be disrupted during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell has any aura interrupt flags set, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the spell's aura can be interrupted by various game mechanics
    such as damage, movement, or other events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->HasAnyAuraInterruptFlag()) {\n    // Spell aura can be interrupted\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine spell interruptibility. Performance considerations are minimal as
    this involves simple flag checking, but it should be used carefully in performance-critical
    code sections.
  warnings: This method does not directly affect spell execution or aura application;
    it merely indicates whether a spell's aura can be interrupted by external factors.
    Be cautious when using this in combination with other interrupt-related methods
    to avoid confusion in spell behavior logic.
