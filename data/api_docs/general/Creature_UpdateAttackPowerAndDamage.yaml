  signature: void Creature::UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage(bool ranged)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the creature's attack power and damage values based on its current
    stats and equipment.
  description: The UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage method recalculates and sets the creature's
    attack power and damage values, taking into account various factors such as base
    stats, equipment, buffs, and debuffs. This method is typically invoked during
    creature initialization, when equipment changes, or when stat modifications occur.
    It ensures that the creature's combat capabilities are accurately reflected in
    the game mechanics. The method accepts a boolean parameter 'ranged' to determine
    whether to calculate melee or ranged attack statistics.
  parameters:
  - name: ranged
    description: Determines whether to update ranged attack power and damage (true)
      or melee attack power and damage (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Melee Attack Power and Damage
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update Ranged Attack Power and Damage
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->UpdateAttackPowerAndDamage(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calls other stat calculation functions and may trigger
    updates to the creature's combat state. It should be called after any changes
    that affect attack power or damage, such as equipment swaps or stat modifications.
    The method does not directly modify the creature's database entry but updates
    in-memory values used for combat calculations.
