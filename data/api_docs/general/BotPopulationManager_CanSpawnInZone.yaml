  signature: bool BotPopulationManager::CanSpawnInZone(uint32 zoneId, uint32 maxBotsPerZone)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot can be spawned in the specified zone based on population
    limits
  description: The CanSpawnInZone method evaluates if it's permissible to spawn a
    new bot within a given zone, considering the maximum allowed bots per zone. This
    method checks against internal tracking of current bot counts in zones and compares
    them against the provided limit. It is typically used during bot creation or spawning
    logic to prevent exceeding configured population thresholds. The method does not
    modify any state but returns a boolean indicating whether spawning is allowed.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone where bot spawning is being considered.
      This ID corresponds to the ZoneDBC or similar internal zone database entry.
  - name: maxBotsPerZone
    description: The maximum number of bots allowed in the specified zone. This value
      defines the upper limit for bot population control in that zone.
  returns: Returns true if a new bot can be spawned in the specified zone without
    exceeding the maximum allowed bots per zone; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a bot can spawn in zone 1234 with max 50 bots
    code: "if (botPopulationManager->CanSpawnInZone(1234, 50)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ bot spawning logic\n    SpawnBot(1234);\n} else {\n    // Do not spawn bot\
      \ due to population limit\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Cannot spawn bot in zone\
      \ 1234 - population limit reached\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic zone-based spawning with configurable limits
    code: "uint32 currentZoneId = player->GetZoneId();\nuint32 maxBots = sWorld->getConfig(CONFIG_UINT32_MAX_BOTS_PER_ZONE);\n\
      if (botPopulationManager->CanSpawnInZone(currentZoneId, maxBots)) {\n    //\
      \ Spawn bot with zone-specific configuration\n    Bot* newBot = CreateBotForZone(currentZoneId);\n\
      \    botPopulationManager->RegisterBot(newBot);\n} else {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      world\", \"Zone %u has reached maximum bot capacity\", currentZoneId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal tracking structures to maintain per-zone
    bot counts. It may be called frequently during bot creation processes, so performance
    is important. The implementation might involve locking mechanisms if concurrent
    access from multiple threads is possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the zoneId passed corresponds to a valid zone in the game
    world; invalid IDs could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Also,
    note that this method only checks against the provided maxBotsPerZone limit and
    does not account for other potential restrictions such as player presence or server
    load.
