documentation:
  brief: Returns the bitmask of criteria types that support retroactive updates in
    the CriteriaMgr.
  description: The GetRetroactivelyUpdateableCriteriaTypes method retrieves a bitmask
    representing all criteria types within the CriteriaMgr that are eligible for retroactive
    updates. This functionality is crucial for handling achievements and criteria
    that may need to be evaluated against historical data or events that occurred
    before the criteria was officially enabled. The returned integer value typically
    represents a bitfield where each bit corresponds to a specific criteria type,
    allowing systems to determine which types of criteria can be updated with past
    data without affecting current tracking mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask indicating which criteria types support retroactive
    updates. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific criteria type
    defined within the system, where set bits represent types that are eligible for
    retroactive update processing.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific criteria type supports retroactive updates
    code: "CriteriaMgr* mgr = sObjectAccessor->GetCriteriaMgr();\nint retroactiveTypes\
      \ = mgr->GetRetroactivelyUpdateableCriteriaTypes();\nif (retroactiveTypes &\
      \ (1 << CRITERIA_TYPE_KILL_CREATURE)) {\n    // The kill creature criteria type\
      \ supports retroactive updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the achievement system to determine
    eligibility for retroactive evaluation of criteria. Developers should be aware
    that the bitmask values are implementation-specific and may change between different
    versions or patches of TrinityCore.
