  method: SetDelayedTeleportFlag
  signature: void Player::SetDelayedTeleportFlag(bool setting)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the delayed teleport flag for the player, indicating a pending teleportation
    action.
  description: The SetDelayedTeleportFlag method is used to control the delayed teleportation
    state of a Player object. When this flag is set to true, it typically indicates
    that the player has initiated a teleportation sequence that will be executed at
    a later time, often after a delay or in response to certain game events. This
    method is commonly used in conjunction with teleportation mechanics within TrinityCore's
    framework. The flag can be used to prevent immediate teleportation actions while
    ensuring proper sequencing of game events. Setting this flag affects the player's
    state and may influence how the server handles subsequent teleportation requests.
  parameters:
  - name: setting
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the delayed teleport flag
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Delayed Teleport Flag
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SetDelayedTeleportFlag(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Delayed Teleport Flag
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SetDelayedTeleportFlag(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal teleportation queues and state
    management. The flag may be checked before allowing new teleportations to prevent
    conflicts or race conditions during active teleport sequences.
  warnings: Setting this flag without proper handling of the teleportation sequence
    may result in unexpected behavior or client disconnections. Ensure that any delayed
    teleport is properly managed and executed after the flag is set.
