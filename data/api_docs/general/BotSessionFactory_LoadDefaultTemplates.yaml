documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads default bot templates for the session factory.
  description: The LoadDefaultTemplates method is responsible for setting up the default
    configuration templates that will be used by the BotSessionFactory to create new
    bot instances. This method typically reads predefined template data from internal
    storage or configuration files, ensuring that bots are initialized with standard
    settings and behaviors. It is usually invoked during system initialization or
    when a new session factory instance is created. The loaded templates define characteristics
    such as bot class, level, equipment, behavior patterns, and other default attributes
    that govern how bots will function within the game environment.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSessionFactory sessionFactory;

      sessionFactory.LoadDefaultTemplates();

      // Bot templates are now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    the BotSessionFactory. Repeated calls may result in duplicate or conflicting template
    data. The method assumes that default template data is available in the system's
    configuration storage.
