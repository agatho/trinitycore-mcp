documentation:
  brief: Sends a point of interest (POI) to the player's client for display on the
    map.
  description: The SendPointOfInterest method is used to transmit a specific point
    of interest identifier to the player's client, enabling the game map to display
    relevant markers or annotations. This functionality is commonly utilized in quest
    systems, NPC interactions, and world events where visual cues are needed to guide
    players. The method does not require any parameters beyond the POI ID, which should
    correspond to an existing entry in the game's point of interest database. When
    called, it triggers a client-side update that renders the specified POI on the
    player's minimap or world map.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Completion
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    // Mark\
      \ the quest's objective location on the map\n    player->PlayerMenu->SendPointOfInterest(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the client receiving valid POI IDs that exist in the
    game's database. Invalid IDs may result in no visual change or potential client-side
    errors. The method is typically called during quest events, NPC dialogues, or
    when a player enters a specific zone where POIs should be highlighted.
