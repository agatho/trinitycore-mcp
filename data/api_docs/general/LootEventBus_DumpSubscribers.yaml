documentation:
  brief: Dumps all registered loot event subscribers to the system log for debugging
    purposes.
  description: The DumpSubscribers method outputs a list of all currently registered
    subscribers to the LootEventBus. This utility function is primarily used for debugging
    and development to inspect which components or systems are listening for loot-related
    events. It iterates through the internal subscriber list and logs each subscriber's
    identifier or type to the system log. The method does not modify any state and
    serves purely as a diagnostic tool. This functionality is typically enabled only
    in debug builds or when specific logging flags are set.

  - title: Basic Usage in Debug Context
    code: LootEventBus::Instance().DumpSubscribers();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for debugging only and should not be called in production
    code. It may have performance implications if used excessively during runtime,
    as it logs each subscriber entry. The output format depends on the internal logging
    implementation of the TrinityCore system.
