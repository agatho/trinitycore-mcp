  class: IBotSpawner
  method: SpawnBot
  signature: bool IBotSpawner::SpawnBot(const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a bot instance using the provided request identifier.
  description: The SpawnBot method is responsible for creating and initializing a
    new bot instance within the TrinityCore environment. It takes a request identifier
    as input which determines the configuration and behavior of the spawned bot. The
    method handles the allocation of necessary resources, initialization of bot AI
    components, and integration into the game world. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with bot management systems to dynamically create bots for testing,
    gameplay enhancement, or automation purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier that specifies the configuration and behavior
      of the bot to be spawned. This value is typically used as a lookup key to retrieve
      predefined bot settings from internal configuration databases.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully spawned and initialized, false
    otherwise. Failure can occur due to invalid request identifiers, insufficient
    system resources, or configuration errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawning
    code: "int spawnRequest = 1001;\nbool success = botSpawner->SpawnBot(spawnRequest);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot successfully spawned\n    printf(\"Bot spawned successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle spawn failure\n    printf(\"Failed to spawn bot\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Bot Spawning with Error Handling
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    bool CreateBot(int configId) {\n     \
      \   if (configId <= 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        \n \
      \       bool result = spawner->SpawnBot(configId);\n        if (!result) {\n\
      \            // Log error or handle accordingly\n            return false;\n\
      \        }\n        \n        // Additional post-spawn logic\n        return\
      \ true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when called frequently, as
    it involves resource allocation and AI initialization. The request parameter should
    be validated before calling to ensure proper bot configuration. The method assumes
    that the IBotSpawner instance is properly initialized and configured within the
    TrinityCore environment.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered request ID may lead
    to undefined behavior or system instability. Ensure that all bot configurations
    are pre-loaded and valid before attempting to spawn bots. This method should not
    be called from within critical sections or high-frequency loops without proper
    synchronization.
