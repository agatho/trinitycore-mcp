  method: HandleOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: bool WarlockAI::HandleOffensiveCooldowns(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles offensive cooldowns for the warlock AI, determining if an offensive
    spell can be cast based on cooldown status and target conditions.
  description: The HandleOffensiveCooldowns method evaluates whether the warlock AI
    is ready to cast an offensive spell. It checks the current state of offensive
    cooldowns, verifies that the target is valid and within range, and ensures that
    the AI has sufficient mana or resources to cast the spell. This method is typically
    called during the AI's decision-making process to determine the next appropriate
    offensive action. The method returns true if a valid offensive spell can be cast
    immediately or false if the AI should wait for cooldowns to expire or resources
    to regenerate.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if an offensive spell can be cast immediately based on cooldown
    and resource availability; otherwise, returns false if the AI should delay casting
    or if no valid offensive action is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "if (me->GetAI()->HandleOffensiveCooldowns(target)) {\n    // Cast offensive\
      \ spell\n    DoCast(target, SPELL_OFFENSIVE_SPELL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision tree
    code: "class MyWarlockAI : public WarlockAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (!UpdateVictim())\n            return;\n\n  \
      \      if (HandleOffensiveCooldowns(me->GetVictim())) {\n            // Proceed\
      \ with offensive spell casting\n            CastOffensiveSpell();\n        }\
      \ else {\n            // Handle cooldown or resource management\n          \
      \  HandleCooldowns();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making logic and should be called
    regularly during the AI update cycle. It relies on internal cooldown tracking
    and target validation, so it's important that the AI's target state is consistent.
    The method does not directly cast spells but rather determines if casting conditions
    are met.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter passed to this method is valid and not
    null; otherwise, the method may behave unpredictably. This method should not be
    used as a standalone spell-casting mechanism without proper resource and cooldown
    checks in place.
