  signature: uint32 ChiSystem::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum chi value allowed for a player's Chi system.
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit of chi that can be accumulated
    by a player character. This value represents the maximum chi capacity and is typically
    determined by the player's class, level, and any applicable buffs or debuffs.
    The returned value is used internally by the Chi system to cap chi accumulation
    and ensure proper gameplay balance. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is read-only.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum chi capacity for the player. This
    value typically ranges from 0 to a class-specific maximum, with common values
    being 4 or 5 for most classes in World of Warcraft's Chi-based systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 maxChi = player->GetCharges();\nuint32 currentMax = player->GetChiSystem()->GetMax();\n\
      if (currentMax > 0)\n{\n    // Use the maximum chi value for calculations\n\
      \    printf(\"Maximum chi: %u\\n\", currentMax);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Chi Management
    code: "ChiSystem* chiSys = player->GetChiSystem();\nuint32 maxChi = chiSys->GetMax();\n\
      uint32 currentChi = chiSys->GetChi();\n\n// Check if player has reached maximum\
      \ chi\nif (currentChi >= maxChi)\n{\n    // Handle overflow or activation logic\n\
      \    player->SetCanUseChi(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player initialization, level-ups,
    or when class abilities modify chi capacity. The maximum chi value may vary based
    on player specialization and equipped items. This method is thread-safe as it
    only reads from immutable state.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned value may change during gameplay due to temporary
    buffs or class-specific mechanics. Always verify the current maximum before performing
    chi-related calculations to avoid incorrect behavior.
