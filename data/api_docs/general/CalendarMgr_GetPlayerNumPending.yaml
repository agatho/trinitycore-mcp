api:
  class: CalendarMgr
  method: GetPlayerNumPending
  signature: uint32 CalendarMgr::GetPlayerNumPending(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of pending calendar invitations for a specified player.
  description: The GetPlayerNumPending method returns the count of calendar events
    that have been invited to but not yet accepted or declined by the specified player.
    This functionality is used within the World of Warcraft calendar system to inform
    players about upcoming events they've been invited to. The method takes a player's
    global unique identifier (GUID) as input and queries the calendar manager for
    pending invitations associated with that player. It does not distinguish between
    different types of pending actions, such as invitations versus requests.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose pending calendar
      events are to be counted. This value uniquely identifies a specific player character
      in the game world.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of pending calendar invitations
    for the specified player. Returns zero if no pending invitations exist or if the
    player GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Get Pending Calendar Invitations Count
    code: "uint32 pendingCount = sCalendarMgr->GetPlayerNumPending(playerGuid);\n\
      if (pendingCount > 0)\n{\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      You have %u pending calendar invitations.\", pendingCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other calendar management
    functions to provide a complete calendar experience for players. The implementation
    likely involves querying internal data structures that track player event invitations
    and their statuses.
  warnings: Ensure the provided GUID corresponds to an actual logged-in player, as
    invalid or non-existent GUIDs may result in incorrect counts or undefined behavior.
    This method should not be called with arbitrary values.
