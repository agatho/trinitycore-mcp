documentation:
  brief: Processes all pending asynchronous callbacks for bot account operations
  description: The ProcessPendingCallbacks method handles execution of queued asynchronous
    operations related to bot accounts. This method iterates through a collection
    of pending callback functions and executes them in the order they were added.
    It is typically called during the game loop or at specific intervals to ensure
    that asynchronous bot account operations are properly completed. The method ensures
    thread safety by using appropriate locking mechanisms when accessing shared data
    structures. This functionality is crucial for maintaining synchronization between
    bot account states and the game world.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    sBotAccountMgr->ProcessPendingCallbacks();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the main game loop to prevent callback
    queue buildup. The implementation uses a thread-safe queue structure to manage
    callbacks, making it safe for concurrent access from multiple threads.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently may cause performance degradation due
    to excessive callback processing. Ensure that callback functions are lightweight
    and do not perform heavy operations that could block the main thread.
