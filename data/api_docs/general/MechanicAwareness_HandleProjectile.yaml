documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles projectile data for a bot player within the MechanicAwareness
    system
  description: The HandleProjectile method is responsible for processing projectile
    information within the MechanicAwareness AI framework. It takes a ProjectileInfo
    structure containing details about a projectile and applies relevant mechanics
    or awareness behaviors to a specified bot player. This method likely evaluates
    projectile trajectory, timing, and potential impact to determine appropriate AI
    responses such as avoidance actions, threat assessment, or reaction behavior.
    The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's AI system where bots must
    react intelligently to environmental hazards and attacks. It serves as a core
    component in enabling bots to maintain situational awareness and respond appropriately
    to incoming projectiles.
  parameters:
  - name: projectile
    description: Const reference to ProjectileInfo structure containing projectile
      data including position, velocity, target, damage type, and other relevant properties
      for AI processing
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to Player object representing the bot that will process and
      react to the projectile information. Must be a valid player instance with AI
      capabilities enabled
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Projectile Handling
    code: 'ProjectileInfo projInfo;

      projInfo.position = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      projInfo.velocity = {50.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f};

      projInfo.damage = 100;

      projInfo.type = ProjectileType::FIREBALL;


      Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      mechanicAwareness->HandleProjectile(projInfo, bot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI awareness system that monitors
    environmental threats. The implementation may involve collision detection, path
    prediction, and reaction timing calculations. Developers should ensure the ProjectileInfo
    structure contains valid data before calling this method to prevent undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: The bot parameter must not be null or invalid; passing an uninitialized
    player reference will result in undefined behavior. This method is typically called
    from within AI update loops and should not be invoked during critical sections
    where thread safety is required.
