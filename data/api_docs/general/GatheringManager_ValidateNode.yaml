  class: GatheringManager
  method: ValidateNode
  signature: bool GatheringManager::ValidateNode(const GatheringNode & node)
documentation:
  brief: Validates a gathering node's integrity and ensures it meets required criteria
    for resource collection.
  description: The ValidateNode method checks whether a given GatheringNode object
    is valid and properly initialized for use in the game world. It verifies that
    essential properties such as position, resource type, and spawn status are correctly
    set. This validation is crucial before attempting to interact with or harvest
    from a gathering node to prevent errors during gameplay. The method typically
    runs checks on node state, ensuring it's not expired, disabled, or otherwise invalid
    for player interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: node
    description: The GatheringNode object to validate. This represents a specific
      resource node in the game world such as a mining vein, herbalism plant, or ore
      deposit.
  returns: Returns true if the gathering node is valid and can be safely used for
    resource collection; returns false if the node fails validation checks such as
    invalid position, missing resource data, or expired state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Node Validation
    code: "GatheringNode node;\n// ... populate node with data ...\nif (gatheringManager.ValidateNode(node))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with harvesting logic\n    std::cout << \"Node is valid\
      \ for harvesting\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid node\n   \
      \ std::cout << \"Invalid node detected\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Interaction
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nGatheringNode* targetNode = player->GetGatheringNode();\n\
      if (targetNode && gatheringManager.ValidateNode(*targetNode)) {\n    // Allow\
      \ player to gather resources\n    player->GatherResource(targetNode);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Notify player that node is no longer available\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      This resource node is no longer accessible.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may perform lightweight checks only, such as verifying required
    fields are non-null or within acceptable ranges. More complex validations like
    checking world state or server-side conditions might be deferred to other systems.
    This method is likely called frequently during gameplay, so performance should
    be optimized.
  warnings: Do not assume that a node is valid after calling this method without revalidating
    in critical sections of code. Nodes can become invalid between the time they are
    initially checked and when they are actually used for interaction.
