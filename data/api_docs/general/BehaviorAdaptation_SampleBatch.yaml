  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: SampleBatch
  signature: int BehaviorAdaptation::SampleBatch(const int & buffer, size_t batchSize)
documentation:
  brief: Samples a batch of behavior data from the adaptation buffer for training
    or analysis.
  description: The SampleBatch method retrieves a specified number of samples from
    an internal behavior adaptation buffer. This function is typically used in AI-driven
    systems to gather recent behavioral data for model training, evaluation, or real-time
    decision making. The method operates on a fixed-size buffer that stores recent
    observations or actions taken by the AI system. It ensures that the sampled data
    represents a diverse set of behaviors within the specified batch size. The function
    may involve internal state management to track sampling indices and maintain data
    integrity across multiple calls.
  parameters:
  - name: buffer
    description: Reference to an integer buffer identifier that specifies which adaptation
      buffer to sample from. This parameter is used to distinguish between different
      behavioral data streams or AI subsystems within the system.
  - name: batchSize
    description: The number of samples to retrieve from the buffer. Must be a positive
      integer representing the desired size of the batch for processing or training
      purposes.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the success or failure status of the sampling
    operation. A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values
    may indicate errors such as invalid buffer identifiers, insufficient data in the
    buffer, or memory allocation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int bufferId = 1;\nsize_t batchSize = 32;\nint result = behaviorAdaptation->SampleBatch(bufferId,\
      \ batchSize);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Successfully sampled batch\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Batch sampled successfully\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n\
      \    std::cerr << \"Failed to sample batch with error code: \" << result <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "class BehaviorAdaptation {\npublic:\n    int SampleBatch(const int& buffer,\
      \ size_t batchSize) {\n        if (batchSize == 0) {\n            return -1;\
      \ // Invalid batch size\n        }\n        \n        // Simulate buffer lookup\
      \ and sampling logic\n        if (buffer < 0 || buffer >= MAX_BUFFERS) {\n \
      \           return -2; // Invalid buffer identifier\n        }\n        \n \
      \       // Assume internal buffer has enough data\n        return 0; // Success\n\
      \    }\n};\n\n// Usage example\nBehaviorAdaptation behaviorAdaptation;\nint\
      \ result = behaviorAdaptation.SampleBatch(5, 100);\nif (result == 0) {\n   \
      \ std::cout << \"Sampled 100 items from buffer 5\" << std::endl;\n} else if\
      \ (result == -1) {\n    std::cerr << \"Invalid batch size specified\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else if (result == -2) {\n    std::cerr << \"Invalid buffer identifier\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not cause race conditions
    when called from multiple threads. The internal buffer management ensures that
    concurrent access does not corrupt data during sampling operations. Performance
    may degrade if batch sizes are excessively large or if the underlying buffer is
    frequently accessed by other systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the buffer identifier passed is valid to avoid undefined behavior.
    Passing a negative buffer ID or an ID exceeding the maximum allowed buffers can
    lead to memory corruption or system instability. Also, be aware that requesting
    a batch size larger than available data in the buffer may result in partial sampling
    or error conditions.
