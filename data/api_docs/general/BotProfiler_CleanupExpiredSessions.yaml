documentation:
  brief: Removes expired bot sessions from the profiler's tracking system.
  description: The CleanupExpiredSessions method is responsible for identifying and
    removing bot sessions that have exceeded their configured lifetime or have otherwise
    become invalid. This method ensures that the profiler does not retain unnecessary
    data about inactive or stale bot sessions, helping to maintain optimal performance
    and memory usage. It typically iterates through the collection of active bot sessions,
    checks each session's expiration time or validity status, and removes those that
    are no longer considered valid. The cleanup process is essential for maintaining
    accurate profiling data and preventing resource leaks in long-running server environments.

    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.CleanupExpiredSessions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically as part of routine maintenance
    to ensure that expired sessions are removed in a timely manner. It is recommended
    to schedule this cleanup operation at intervals appropriate for your server's
    bot activity patterns.
