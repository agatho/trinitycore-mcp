  method: GetTarget
  signature: int * HealInfo::GetTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the target identifier associated with the heal information.
  description: The GetTarget method retrieves a pointer to an integer representing
    the target's unique identifier (GUID) within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    is typically used in healing-related game mechanics to identify which unit or
    player is being healed. The returned pointer allows direct access to the target's
    GUID value, which can be used for validation, tracking, or further processing
    within the combat system. The method is const, indicating it does not modify any
    internal state of the HealInfo object. This functionality is essential for proper
    healing spell execution and targeting logic in World of Warcraft emulation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the target's GUID. The caller should
    ensure the returned pointer remains valid during its usage, as it points to internal
    data within the HealInfo object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "HealInfo* healInfo = new HealInfo();\nint* targetGuid = healInfo->GetTarget();\n\
      if (targetGuid != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the target GUID for further processing\n\
      \    uint64 targetId = static_cast<uint64>(*targetGuid);\n    // Process healing\
      \ logic based on target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer points to internal data within the HealInfo object.
    Developers should not attempt to free or modify the memory pointed to by this
    return value. The method assumes that the HealInfo object has been properly initialized
    with a valid target GUID.
  warnings: Using the returned pointer after the HealInfo object has been destroyed
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure proper lifetime management of the HealInfo
    object when using this method.
