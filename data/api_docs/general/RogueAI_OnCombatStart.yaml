  class: RogueAI
  method: OnCombatStart
  signature: void RogueAI::OnCombatStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes rogue AI behavior when entering combat with a target.
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a RogueAI-controlled NPC enters
    combat mode. This method sets up the initial state and behavior for the rogue's
    combat actions, including targeting the specified enemy and preparing any necessary
    abilities or strategies. It typically initializes combat-related variables and
    may trigger specific rogue mechanics such as stealth detection or positioning.
    The method ensures that the AI is properly configured to engage in combat with
    the provided target.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier (GUID)
      or index within the combat system. This value determines which entity the rogue
      will engage in combat with.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OnCombatStart
    code: 'RogueAI ai;

      int enemyGuid = 12345;

      ai.OnCombatStart(&enemyGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore AI system when
    a rogue NPC transitions into combat state. Developers should ensure that the target
    parameter points to a valid entity before calling this method.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure the target exists and is accessible within the current combat
    context.
