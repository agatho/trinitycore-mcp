  notes: This method performs a lookup in the player's active spell list, which may
    involve checking spell book entries. Performance considerations include potential

  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with spells that might be removed from
    active state due to cooldowns or other game mechanics; ensure proper handling
    of spell states.
