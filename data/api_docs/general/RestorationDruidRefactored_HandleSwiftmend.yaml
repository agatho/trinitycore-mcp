  signature: bool RestorationDruidRefactored::HandleSwiftmend(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Swiftmend spell effect to a target within the specified group
  description: The HandleSwiftmend method implements the core logic for the Druid's
    Swiftmend ability, which is a healing spell that can be cast on a target within
    a specified group. This method typically handles the spell's casting mechanics,
    including validation of the target, calculation of healing amount, application
    of any relevant buffs or debuffs, and updating the player's cooldown state. The
    method operates within the context of the Restoration Druid class and integrates
    with TrinityCore's spell system to ensure proper execution and synchronization
    with game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group index specifying which target to apply Swiftmend to. Valid
      values are typically 0-4 representing different group members, or -1 for self-cast.
      The method uses this parameter to determine the target of the spell within the
      player's current group context.
  returns: Returns true if the Swiftmend spell was successfully cast and applied to
    the target, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate failed validation
    checks, invalid target selection, insufficient mana, or cooldown restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Swiftmend Usage
    code: "if (player->GetClass() == CLASS_DRUID) {\n    RestorationDruidRefactored*\
      \ druid = static_cast<RestorationDruidRefactored*>(player);\n    bool success\
      \ = druid->HandleSwiftmend(0); // Cast on first group member\n    if (success)\
      \ {\n        // Swiftmend applied successfully\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Swiftmend with Self-Cast
    code: "if (player->GetClass() == CLASS_DRUID) {\n    RestorationDruidRefactored*\
      \ druid = static_cast<RestorationDruidRefactored*>(player);\n    bool success\
      \ = druid->HandleSwiftmend(-1); // Cast on self\n    if (success) {\n      \
      \  // Self-healing applied successfully\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Restoration Druid's spell handling system and
    should only be called by the Druid class or its derived implementations. The method
    assumes proper initialization of the Druid's spell context and target validation
    has already occurred. Performance considerations include checking group validity
    before processing to avoid unnecessary computations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper Druid class validation may result in
    undefined behavior. The group parameter must be validated to prevent out-of-bounds
    access. Ensure that the target is valid and within range before calling this method
    to avoid spell failure conditions.
