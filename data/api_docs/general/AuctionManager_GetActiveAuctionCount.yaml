documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of currently active auctions in the auction house
    system
  description: The GetActiveAuctionCount method retrieves the number of auctions that
    are currently listed and available for bidding within the auction house. This
    count includes all auctions that have not yet expired or been purchased, regardless
    of their item type, bid amount, or seller. The method provides a quick way to
    determine the current load or activity level of the auction house system without
    needing to iterate through individual auction entries. This information is useful
    for server administrators, game mechanics, and client-side UI elements that need
    to display auction house statistics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active auctions currently
    listed in the auction house system. Returns 0 if there are no active auctions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Display Active Auction Count
    code: "void ShowAuctionStats()\n{\n    uint32 activeCount = sAuctionMgr->GetActiveAuctionCount();\n\
      \    printf(\"Currently %u auctions are active in the auction house.\\n\", activeCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Active Auction Count for Server Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorAuctionHouse()\n{\n    uint32 count = sAuctionMgr->GetActiveAuctionCount();\n\
      \    if (count > 1000)\n    {\n        sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SERVER_LOADING,\
      \ \"High auction activity detected: %u active auctions\", count);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation and should have minimal performance
    impact. The returned value is updated in real-time as auctions are created, purchased,
    or expire. This method does not distinguish between different auction categories
    or item qualities; it simply counts all active listings.
