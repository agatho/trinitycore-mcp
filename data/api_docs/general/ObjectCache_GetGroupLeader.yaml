  class: ObjectCache
  method: GetGroupLeader
  signature: Player * ObjectCache::GetGroupLeader() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the player who is the leader of the group associated with this object
    cache.
  description: The GetGroupLeader method retrieves the Player object that currently
    holds the leadership position within the group to which the ObjectCache instance
    belongs. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to determine the group leader for operations such as loot distribution, role assignments,
    or permission checks. The returned Player pointer may be null if the cache does
    not belong to a group or if there is no active group leader. This function performs
    no direct validation on the group state and assumes that the internal group reference
    is valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object representing the group leader, or nullptr
    if no group leader exists or the cache is not associated with a group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* leader = objectCache->GetGroupLeader();\nif (leader)\n{\n    ChatHandler(leader->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"\
      You are the group leader.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Leadership Before Action
    code: "ObjectCache* cache = player->GetObjectCache();\nPlayer* leader = cache->GetGroupLeader();\n\
      if (leader && leader == player)\n{\n    // Perform leader-only actions\n   \
      \ SendGroupLootRolls();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the ObjectCache to maintain a
    valid reference to the group. The returned Player pointer should not be stored
    for extended periods as the group leader may change or the player may leave the
    group. It is recommended to re-fetch the group leader when performing time-sensitive
    operations.
  warnings: The method returns a raw pointer which can be null. Always check for nullptr
    before using the returned value to avoid segmentation faults. Additionally, since
    this method is part of the ObjectCache class, it should only be called on valid
    ObjectCache instances that are properly initialized with group data.
