  class: Creature
  method: Update
  signature: void Creature::Update(uint32 time)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the creature's state and behavior based on the elapsed game time.
  description: The Creature::Update method is responsible for processing all time-based
    updates for a creature instance. This includes handling AI behaviors, movement
    updates, combat states, and other time-sensitive operations. The method is typically
    called by the game loop at regular intervals to ensure that creatures respond
    appropriately to changes in the game world over time. It processes queued actions,
    manages threat lists, handles spell casting delays, and updates the creature's
    internal state according to the provided time delta.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The elapsed time in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to determine how much time has passed for processing AI behaviors,
      movement, and other time-dependent systems.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateCreatures(uint32 diff)\n{\n    for (auto& creature\
      \ : m_creatures)\n    {\n        if (creature)\n            creature->Update(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creature Update with AI Processing
    code: "void Creature::Update(uint32 time)\n{\n    // Process AI behavior\n   \
      \ if (HasAI())\n        m_AI->UpdateAI(time);\n    \n    // Handle movement\
      \ updates\n    UpdateMovement(time);\n    \n    // Process combat state\n  \
      \  UpdateCombat(time);\n    \n    // Update any ongoing spell effects\n    UpdateSpells(time);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called frequently by the game engine's main update loop. It
    should be optimized to avoid heavy computations that could impact performance.
    The time parameter represents the actual elapsed time in milliseconds, which may
    vary between frames depending on system performance.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from AI scripts or other time-sensitive
    code paths without understanding its implications. Avoid performing expensive
    operations within this method as it's called very frequently during gameplay.
