  brief: Returns the current cast time of a spell in milliseconds
  description: This method retrieves the current cast time for a specified spell,
    which is crucial for understanding spell mechanics and timing in World of Warcraft.
    It returns the time in milliseconds that a spell currently takes to cast, considering
    factors such as haste modifiers, spell effects, and game mechanics. The method
    is particularly useful for determining when a spell will complete its casting
    process, especially in scenarios involving multiple spells or complex spell interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the cast time of the spell in milliseconds, or 0 if the spell is
    not currently being cast or does not exist
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int32 castTime = unit->GetCurrentSpellCastTime(12345); // Get cast time
      for spell ID 12345
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine the timing of spell casting. It may return values based on current
    game state and can be affected by various modifiers including haste, spell effects,
    and buffs/debuffs.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only returns valid results when a spell is actively
    being cast; calling it outside of active casting periods will result in zero or
    invalid values. Also, the returned value may change based on game mechanics and
    player state.
