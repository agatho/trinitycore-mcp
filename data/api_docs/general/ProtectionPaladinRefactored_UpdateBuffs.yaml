  brief: Updates all active buff states for the Protection Paladin.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs and auras that are currently applied to the Protection Paladin. This
    includes checking for expired buffs, applying new buffs based on current conditions,
    and ensuring that the paladin's defensive and offensive capabilities remain properly
    synchronized with their current state in the game world. The method typically
    runs during each update cycle of the AI or game loop, ensuring that the paladin
    maintains optimal buff status throughout combat and non-combat scenarios.

    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n    m_paladin->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop or AI system.
    Developers should not manually invoke this unless implementing custom behavior
    that requires explicit buff state management.
