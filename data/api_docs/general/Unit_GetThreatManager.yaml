documentation:
  brief: Returns the threat manager identifier for the unit
  description: This method retrieves the threat manager associated with the Unit object,
    which is used to track and manage the unit's threat level within the game world.
    The threat manager is essential for determining how much threat a unit generates
    towards targets, particularly in combat situations where NPCs or players need
    to maintain proper targeting. This method is commonly used in conjunction with
    other threat-related functions to ensure proper combat behavior and AI decision-making.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer identifier representing the threat manager associated
    with the unit. This value typically corresponds to a unique identifier used internally
    by TrinityCore for tracking threat levels within the game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetThreatManager();

      int threatId = target->GetThreatManager();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be used carefully as it may return a value that is not
    directly exposed to developers but rather managed internally by the TrinityCore
    framework. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls to this
    method during combat situations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combat scenarios, as improper
    handling can lead to incorrect threat management and potentially cause units to
    lose targeting or fail to maintain proper combat behavior.
