  signature: void SupportMgr::~SupportMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SupportMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~SupportMgr destructor is automatically invoked when a SupportMgr
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, release of system resources, and
    termination of any ongoing operations managed by the SupportMgr instance. In the
    context of TrinityCore's architecture, this destructor likely handles cleanup
    of support-related data structures, such as cached data, temporary allocations,
    or internal state management that may have been initialized during the object's
    lifetime. The destructor is a critical part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition
    Is Initialization) pattern used throughout the codebase to prevent memory leaks
    and ensure stable operation.

  - title: Automatic destruction of SupportMgr instance
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    SupportMgr* mgr = new SupportMgr();\n   \
      \ // ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object goes
    out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor
    unless performing explicit memory management. The implementation likely includes
    cleanup routines for internal data structures and may perform logging or state
    synchronization if required by the support manager's functionality.
