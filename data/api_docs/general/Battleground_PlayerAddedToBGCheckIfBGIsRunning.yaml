  signature: void Battleground::PlayerAddedToBGCheckIfBGIsRunning(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has been added to a running battleground and triggers
    appropriate actions.
  description: This method is invoked when a player is added to a battleground to
    determine whether the battleground is already in progress. If the battleground
    is running, it performs necessary initialization steps for the player, such as
    sending relevant game state updates, updating player statistics, or applying any
    required gameplay mechanics. It ensures that players who join a battleground after
    it has started are properly integrated into the ongoing match rather than being
    treated as new participants. This method typically acts as part of the internal
    battleground lifecycle management and is called automatically by the core system
    when players are added to a BG.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within battleground logic
    code: "void SomeBattleground::HandlePlayerJoin(Player* player)\n{\n    // Add\
      \ player to battleground\n    AddPlayer(player);\n    \n    // Check if BG is\
      \ running and initialize player accordingly\n    PlayerAddedToBGCheckIfBGIsRunning(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the battleground state has already been validated
    to confirm it's in a 'running' phase. It may internally call other methods like
    SendInitialWorldStates or UpdatePlayerScores depending on the battleground type.
