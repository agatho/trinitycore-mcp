  class: PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker
  method: RegisterTrackedObject
  signature: void PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker::RegisterTrackedObject(uint32 phaseId,
    WorldObject * object)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a WorldObject to be tracked for a specific phase ID within the
    player's personal phases system.
  description: The RegisterTrackedObject method associates a WorldObject with a specific
    phase identifier, allowing the player's personal phases tracker to monitor and
    manage the object's visibility or interaction based on active phases. This functionality
    is essential for implementing phased content such as quest objectives, event triggers,
    or dynamic world changes that should only be visible or interactable during certain
    game phases. The method typically integrates with TrinityCore's phase system where
    objects can exist in multiple phases simultaneously but are only visible to players
    whose active phases include the specified phase ID.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseId
    description: The unique identifier of the phase to associate with the tracked
      object. Must be a valid phase ID defined within the game's phase system, typically
      ranging from 1 to several thousand depending on server configuration.
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that should be tracked for the specified
      phase. The object must be valid and not null; attempting to register a null
      object may result in undefined behavior or system errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Tracking Registration
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      WorldObject* questGiver = ...;

      player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->RegisterTrackedObject(12345, questGiver);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Multiple Objects for Same Phase
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      WorldObject* npc1 = ...;

      WorldObject* npc2 = ...;

      player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->RegisterTrackedObject(54321, npc1);

      player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->RegisterTrackedObject(54321, npc2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the phase system and should not
    be called directly unless implementing custom phased content. The tracked objects
    are managed automatically by the player's personal phases tracker based on phase
    changes. Ensure that the phase ID exists in the server's phase configuration to
    avoid silent failures.
  warnings: Passing a null WorldObject pointer will likely cause crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always validate object pointers before calling this method. Registering
    an invalid phase ID may lead to objects not being properly tracked during phase
    transitions.
