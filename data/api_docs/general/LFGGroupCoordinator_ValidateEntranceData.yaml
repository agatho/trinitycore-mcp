  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: ValidateEntranceData
  signature: bool LFGGroupCoordinator::ValidateEntranceData(uint32 mapId, float x,
    float y, float z) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates entrance data for a group coordinator's LFG (Looking For Group)
    system to ensure proper map and location coordinates.
  description: The ValidateEntranceData method checks whether the provided map ID
    and coordinate values (x, y, z) are valid for use within the LFG group coordination
    system. This validation ensures that players attempting to join or create groups
    in specific locations have valid entrance data before proceeding with further
    operations such as teleportation or quest initiation. The method typically verifies
    that the map exists, the coordinates fall within acceptable ranges, and that the
    location is accessible for group activities. It's an essential part of maintaining
    game integrity and preventing errors during group matching and coordination processes.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the game map where the entrance data is
      being validated. Must correspond to a valid map in the game database.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the entrance location on the map. Should be within
      the bounds of the specified map.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the entrance location on the map. Should be within
      the bounds of the specified map.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate (height) of the entrance location on the map. Should
      represent a valid elevation for the given map and terrain.
  returns: Returns true if all provided entrance data is valid and can be used within
    the LFG system; otherwise returns false if any validation check fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->ValidateEntranceData(1234, 100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with group creation or teleportation\n    std::cout << \"\
      Entrance data is valid\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid entrance\
      \ data\n    std::cout << \"Invalid entrance data provided\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with LFG Group Creation
    code: "uint32 mapId = 530; // Outland\nfloat x = 1234.5f, y = 6789.0f, z = 345.2f;\n\
      if (groupCoordinator->ValidateEntranceData(mapId, x, y, z)) {\n    // Create\
      \ LFG group with valid entrance data\n    LFGGroup* group = new LFGGroup(mapId,\
      \ x, y, z);\n    // Add players to the group\n} else {\n    // Log error and\
      \ prevent group creation\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid entrance coordinates\
      \ for map %u\", mapId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against internal game data structures
    such as map boundaries, terrain height limits, and accessibility flags. It may
    also validate that the specified map supports LFG activities. The method is probably
    called during group creation or before teleporting players to ensure they are
    entering valid locations.
  warnings: Invalid coordinates or map IDs could lead to unexpected behavior in the
    LFG system, including failed group matching or client-side errors. Always validate
    entrance data before using it for group operations.
