  class: WindwalkerMonkRefactored
  method: GenerateChi
  signature: void WindwalkerMonkRefactored::GenerateChi(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates chi for the Windwalker Monk character based on the provided amount.
  description: The GenerateChi method is responsible for increasing the chi resource
    of a Windwalker Monk character by a specified amount. This method typically corresponds
    to game mechanics where the monk gains chi through various actions such as dealing
    damage, using abilities, or performing specific combat maneuvers. The method modifies
    the internal chi counter of the monk instance and may trigger visual effects or
    updates to the UI to reflect the increased chi. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with other monk abilities that consume chi for their execution.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of chi to be generated. Must be a non-negative integer
      value representing the amount of chi to add to the monk's current chi pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Generation
    code: 'WindwalkerMonkRefactored* monk = ...;

      monk->GenerateChi(10); // Adds 10 chi to the monk''s current pool'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Chi Generation
    code: "WindwalkerMonkRefactored* monk = ...;\nif (monk->GetChi() < 100) {\n  \
      \  monk->GenerateChi(5);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid Windwalker Monk instances. The
    implementation may include checks to prevent chi overflow beyond the maximum allowed
    value for the class. It is recommended to call this method after performing actions
    that grant chi, such as successful attacks or ability usage.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value for amount will likely cause
    undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the monk instance is properly initialized
    before invoking this method. Avoid calling this method in high-frequency loops
    without proper throttling to prevent performance issues.
