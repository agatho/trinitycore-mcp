documentation:
  brief: Updates area-dependent auras for the player based on the provided area ID
  description: The UpdateAreaDependentAuras method is responsible for managing and
    updating auras that are dependent on the player's current geographical area. This
    method ensures that auras which have area restrictions or are triggered by specific
    zones are properly applied or removed when the player enters or leaves an area.
    It typically handles zone-based buffs, debuffs, environmental effects, and other
    gameplay mechanics that vary based on the player's location within the game world.
    The method is commonly invoked during area transitions or when a player's position
    changes significantly.
  parameters:
  - name: area_id
    description: The unique identifier of the area where the player currently resides
      or has moved to. This ID corresponds to entries in the AreaTable.dbc file and
      determines which area-dependent auras should be active or inactive.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating auras when entering a new area
    code: "void Player::OnAreaChange(uint32 new_area_id)\n{\n    UpdateAreaDependentAuras(new_area_id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manually triggering area-dependent aura update
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 current_area = player->GetAreaId();

      player->UpdateAreaDependentAuras(current_area);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger multiple internal updates including aura application/removal,
    stat recalculations, and visual effect updates. It's typically called automatically
    by the core when a player moves between areas, but can also be manually invoked
    for special cases or testing purposes.
  warnings: Invoking this method with an invalid area ID may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect aura states. Ensure that the area ID passed is valid and corresponds
    to an actual zone in the game world database.
