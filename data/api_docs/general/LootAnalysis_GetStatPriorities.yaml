  class: LootAnalysis
  method: GetStatPriorities
  signature: int LootAnalysis::GetStatPriorities(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the stat priorities for the specified player based
    on their class, specialization, and current loot analysis data.
  description: The GetStatPriorities method determines the optimal distribution of
    statistical attributes (such as Strength, Agility, Intellect, etc.) for a given
    player character. This calculation takes into account the player's class, current
    specialization, equipped items, and the overall loot analysis context. The method
    is typically used in loot distribution systems to determine how valuable different
    stats are for a specific player in their current gear and role. It serves as a
    core component in TrinityCore's loot optimization algorithms, helping to ensure
    that players receive loot that maximizes their performance based on their current
    needs and playstyle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated stat priority score
    for the player. This score is typically used internally by the loot system to
    sort and prioritize loot distribution among players in a group or raid context.
    A higher return value generally indicates that the player has a greater need or
    benefit from certain types of stats.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is already initialized

      int priority = lootAnalysis->GetStatPriorities(player);

      // Use priority value for loot distribution logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations based on the player's current gear,
    stats, and role in the group. The implementation may involve complex algorithms
    that consider item levels, stat weights, and class-specific requirements. It is
    recommended to call this method only when necessary as it might involve expensive
    computations.
  warnings: The method assumes that the player parameter is valid and properly initialized.
    Calling this method with a null or invalid player pointer could result in undefined
    behavior. Additionally, the returned priority value should not be used directly
    for loot decisions without proper context from the overall loot system.
