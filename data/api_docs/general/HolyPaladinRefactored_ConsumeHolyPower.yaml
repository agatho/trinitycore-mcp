  class: HolyPaladinRefactored
  method: ConsumeHolyPower
  signature: void HolyPaladinRefactored::ConsumeHolyPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of holy power from the Holy Paladin instance
  description: "The ConsumeHolyPower method reduces the current holy power resource\
    \ of a Holy Paladin character by the specified amount. This method is typically\
    \ used when executing holy power-based abilities or spells that require\u6D88\u8017\
    \ of holy power. The method ensures that the holy power value does not drop below\
    \ zero, and may trigger related game mechanics such as cooldown resets or ability\
    \ updates. It serves as a core component in managing the holy power resource system\
    \ for Holy Paladins within the TrinityCore framework."
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of holy power to consume from the Paladin's resource
      pool. Must be a non-negative integer value representing the amount of holy power
      to deduct.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Holy Power Consumption
    code: 'HolyPaladinRefactored paladin;

      // Consume 5 units of holy power

      paladin.ConsumeHolyPower(5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Holy Power Consumption
    code: "HolyPaladinRefactored paladin;\nuint32 requiredPower = 10;\nif (paladin.GetHolyPower()\
      \ >= requiredPower)\n{\n    paladin.ConsumeHolyPower(requiredPower);\n    //\
      \ Execute holy power-based ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Paladin has sufficient holy power
    available. The implementation likely interacts with internal resource tracking
    mechanisms and may update UI elements or trigger game events related to holy power
    changes.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the current holy power
    will result in the holy power being reduced to zero, which may have unintended
    consequences for gameplay mechanics that depend on maintaining minimum holy power
    levels.
