  signature: void FrostDeathKnight::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for all abilities and talents of the Frost Death
    Knight.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking system for a Frost Death Knight class instance.
    This method processes the elapsed time since the last update (passed via the 'diff'
    parameter) and decrements or resets cooldown timers for various abilities, talents,
    and passive effects associated with the frost specialization. It ensures that
    abilities become available again once their cooldown periods have expired, maintaining
    game balance and proper resource management. The method is typically called during
    the creature's AI update cycle to keep cooldown states synchronized with the game
    time.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last cooldown update.
      This value determines how much time has passed and is used to decrement active
      cooldown timers accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void FrostDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic ...\n    m_frostDK->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom cooldown handling
    code: "void FrostDeathKnight::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_cooldownTimer\
      \ > 0)\n        m_cooldownTimer = std::max(0u, m_cooldownTimer - diff);\n\n\
      \    // Update other ability cooldowns\n    for (auto& cd : m_abilityCooldowns)\n\
      \    {\n        if (cd > 0)\n            cd = std::max(0u, cd - diff);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    accurate cooldown tracking. The implementation may involve checking multiple internal
    timers and resetting them when they reach zero. It's important that this method
    does not block or perform heavy operations as it's typically invoked frequently.
  warnings: Improper handling of the 'diff' parameter can lead to incorrect cooldown
    behavior, such as abilities becoming available too soon or remaining on cooldown
    indefinitely. Ensure that the time delta passed is accurate and represents actual
    elapsed game time.
