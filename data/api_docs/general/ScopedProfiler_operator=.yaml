  brief: Moves ownership of a ScopedProfiler instance to another instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers the resources and state from
    one ScopedProfiler instance to another. This operation is typically used when
    moving a profiler object from one variable to another, allowing efficient resource
    management without copying. The source profiler is left in a valid but unspecified
    state after the move. In the context of TrinityCore's profiling system, this enables
    efficient handling of profiler objects during performance monitoring and debugging
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the destination ScopedProfiler instance, allowing for chained
    assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic move assignment usage
    code: 'ScopedProfiler profiler1;

      // ... profiler1 is used ...

      ScopedProfiler profiler2 = std::move(profiler1); // Move profiler1 to profiler2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained move assignment
    code: 'ScopedProfiler p1, p2, p3;

      // ... use profilers ...

      p3 = std::move(p2) = std::move(p1); // Chained move operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented as a move operation that transfers
    internal resources like timing data and profiling state. The moved-from object
    should not be used after the move operation, though it remains in a valid state.
    In TrinityCore's context, this supports efficient profiler management during high-frequency
    performance measurements.
  warnings: After calling move assignment, the source object should not be accessed
    or used as its state becomes undefined. This is a fundamental rule of move semantics
    that must be followed to avoid undefined behavior.
