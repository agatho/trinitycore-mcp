  method: GetSkillLineIdByPos
  signature: uint16 Player::GetSkillLineIdByPos(uint32 pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the skill line identifier at the specified position in the player's
    skill list.
  description: This method retrieves the skill line ID (or skill type) associated
    with a specific position in the player's skill list. It is commonly used to access
    skill information for various game mechanics such as crafting, professions, or
    other skill-based systems. The method operates on the player's internal skill
    list structure and returns a uint16 value representing the skill line ID. This
    functionality is essential for retrieving specific skill data during gameplay
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the skill line ID at the specified
    position in the player's skill list. The value typically corresponds to a skill
    type or profession identifier, and may be zero if no skill exists at that position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint16 skillId = player->GetSkillLineIdByPos(0);

      // Returns the skill line ID of the first skill in player''s list'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "uint16 skillId = player->GetSkillLineIdByPos(5);\nif (skillId != 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Process skill line ID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No skill at position 5\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the player's internal skill management system and should
    be used carefully when accessing skill data. Performance considerations include
    avoiding unnecessary calls to this method during gameplay loops, as it may involve
    indexing operations within the skill list.
  warnings: This method assumes that the position passed is valid and within bounds
    of the player's skill list. Using invalid positions may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. Also, note that skill line IDs are not necessarily unique
    across all players and can vary based on player class, race, or other factors.
