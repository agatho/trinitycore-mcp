  class: GameObject
  method: SetSpellVisualId
  signature: void GameObject::SetSpellVisualId(int32 spellVisualId, int activatorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spell visual ID for a game object, determining its visual appearance
    and effects.
  description: The SetSpellVisualId method assigns a specific spell visual ID to a
    GameObject instance, which controls how the object appears visually in the game
    world. This method is typically used to set visual effects for game objects like
    doors, buttons, or other interactive elements that have associated spell visuals.
    The spell visual ID determines what visual effect is displayed when the object
    is interacted with or activated. This method should be called during object initialization
    or when changing the visual state of an object.
  parameters:
  - name: spellVisualId
    description: The spell visual ID to assign to the GameObject. This value determines
      the visual effect displayed for the object, typically corresponding to a specific
      spell visual in the game database.
  - name: activatorGuid
    description: The GUID of the activator (usually player or creature) that triggered
      the visual effect. This parameter is used to determine which entity activated
      the visual effect and may be required for proper visual handling.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetSpellVisualId(12345, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with activator GUID
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      Player* player = GetPlayer();

      go->SetSpellVisualId(54321, player->GetGUID());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the visual appearance
    of game objects. The spell visual ID must be valid and correspond to an existing
    spell visual in the database. This method does not trigger any visual effects
    on its own; it merely sets the ID for future activation.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect visual behavior or missing
    effects. Care should be taken to ensure that the spellVisualId corresponds to
    valid spell visuals in the database. The activatorGuid parameter may be required
    for proper visual handling depending on the context.
