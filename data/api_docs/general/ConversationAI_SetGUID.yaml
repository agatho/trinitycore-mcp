  method: SetGUID
  signature: void ConversationAI::SetGUID(const int & guid, int32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID and ID for a conversation AI instance
  description: The SetGUID method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) and an associated
    ID to a ConversationAI object. This method is typically used during the initialization
    or setup phase of a conversation AI, allowing the system to track and manage specific
    conversation instances. The GUID identifies the entity involved in the conversation
    while the ID provides additional context or classification for the conversation
    itself. This method is crucial for proper conversation handling within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity involved in the conversation.
      This should be a valid GUID value that uniquely identifies the NPC or player
      participating in the dialogue.
  - name: id
    description: An integer ID that provides additional classification or context
      for the conversation. This value is used internally by the AI system to distinguish
      between different conversation types or instances.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SetGUID
    code: 'ConversationAI* conversation = new ConversationAI();

      conversation->SetGUID(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting GUID with dynamic values
    code: 'uint64 playerGUID = player->GetGUID();

      int32 conversationID = GetNextConversationID();

      conversationAI->SetGUID(playerGUID, conversationID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the initialization of a ConversationAI
    object. The GUID parameter must represent a valid entity in the game world, otherwise
    the conversation may not function correctly. The ID parameter is used internally
    by the AI system for managing conversation states and should be unique per conversation
    instance.
  warnings: Calling SetGUID with an invalid or non-existent GUID can lead to undefined
    behavior or conversation failures. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a valid
    entity in the game world before calling this method. Do not call this method after
    the conversation has already started, as it may disrupt ongoing dialogue.
