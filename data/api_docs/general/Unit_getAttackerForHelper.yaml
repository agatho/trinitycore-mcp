  signature: Unit * Unit::getAttackerForHelper() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the attacker that is assisting the unit in combat.
  description: This method retrieves the Unit that is currently attacking the specified
    unit and providing assistance in combat. It is commonly used in game mechanics
    where a unit's attacker needs to be identified for various purposes such as determining
    which target to attack, calculating damage, or handling combat situations. The
    method returns a pointer to the Unit object representing the attacker, or nullptr
    if no attacker exists. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper
    combat behavior and ensuring accurate targeting in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit that is assisting in combat with the specified
    unit, or nullptr if no such attacker exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* attacker = unit->getAttackerForHelper();\nif (attacker != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process the attacker\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat-related code to determine which unit
    is attacking the current unit. It may return nullptr if no attacker exists, and
    should be used carefully in scenarios where multiple attackers are present.
  warnings: This method does not guarantee that the returned Unit is actively attacking
    the current unit; it may return a Unit that is assisting in combat but not necessarily
    directly attacking.
