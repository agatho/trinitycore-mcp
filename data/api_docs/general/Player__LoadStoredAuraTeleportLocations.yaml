documentation:
  brief: Loads stored aura teleport locations for the player.
  description: This method retrieves and processes stored teleport location data for
    a player's aura effects, specifically handling the loading of teleportation-related
    aura data from database storage. It is part of the player's initialization process
    and ensures that teleportation abilities are properly loaded and configured for
    the player's current state. The method handles the loading of various teleport-related
    aura effects that may be stored in the database.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_LoadStoredAuraTeleportLocations(0);

      // This loads teleport locations for player''s aura effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player initialization or when loading
    aura data from database. Implementation may involve database queries to retrieve
    stored teleport location data, and it's important that this method is called before
    any teleportation-related operations are performed.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code; it's an internal
    method used during player initialization. Calling this method at inappropriate
    times could cause data inconsistencies or incorrect teleportation behavior.
