  class: PlayerAI
  method: IsPlayerHealer
  signature: bool PlayerAI::IsPlayerHealer(const int * who)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is classified as a healer class.
  description: The IsPlayerHealer method checks if the player's class is categorized
    as a healing class within the TrinityCore framework. This function evaluates the
    player's current class and returns true if it matches known healer classes such
    as Priest, Druid, Shaman, or Paladin (with appropriate spec checks). The method
    is typically used in AI behavior logic to determine appropriate spell selection,
    targeting strategies, or role-based actions for NPC or player-controlled entities.
    It may also be utilized in combat routines to prioritize healing over damage dealing
    when the AI detects a healer class.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Optional pointer to an integer representing the target player ID
      or index. If null, the method defaults to checking the current player's class.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is classified as a healer class (Priest,
    Druid, Shaman, or Paladin with healing specialization), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if current player is a healer
    code: "if (playerAI->IsPlayerHealer(nullptr)) {\n    // Player is a healer class\n\
      \    playerAI->CastSpellOnTarget(HEALING_SPELL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking specific target for healer status
    code: "Player* target = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(targetId));\n\
      if (target && playerAI->IsPlayerHealer(&targetId)) {\n    // Target is a healer,\
      \ adjust behavior accordingly\n    playerAI->SetTarget(target);\n    playerAI->CastSpellOnTarget(HEALING_SPELL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on class identification logic within TrinityCore's player
    system. The implementation may vary based on the game version and specific class
    definitions. It is recommended to use this method in conjunction with other AI
    state checks for comprehensive behavior management.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'who' parameter points to a valid player object or ID,
    otherwise the function may return unexpected results or cause undefined behavior.
    The method does not account for temporary class changes or specializations beyond
    standard healing roles.
