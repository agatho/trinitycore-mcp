  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: RequiresSoak
  signature: bool MechanicAwareness::RequiresSoak(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell requires soaking mechanics to be applied.
  description: The RequiresSoak method checks if a given spell ID is associated with
    a mechanic that requires soaking behavior. This functionality is typically used
    in TrinityCore's combat system to determine how certain spells should interact
    with defensive abilities or damage mitigation systems. The method evaluates the
    spell's properties and returns true if the spell's mechanic type necessitates
    that it be processed through soaking logic, which may involve absorbing or reducing
    incoming damage based on specific conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell requires soaking mechanics to be applied;
    otherwise, returns false. This indicates whether the spell should be handled through
    the game's soaking system for damage mitigation or absorption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (mechanicAwareness->RequiresSoak(12345)) {\n    // Handle spell with\
      \ soaking mechanics\n    printf(\"Spell requires soaking\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell mechanic mappings and may be
    used in conjunction with other combat-related systems such as damage absorption,
    mitigation calculations, or aura applications. The implementation might cache
    results for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method is valid and registered
    within the TrinityCore database; invalid IDs could lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes. This method should only be called during appropriate combat or spell
    processing phases.
