  class: WorldMapScript
  method: WorldMapScript
  signature: void WorldMapScript::WorldMapScript(const char * name, uint32 mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a WorldMapScript instance with a name and map identifier.
  description: The WorldMapScript constructor initializes a new instance of the WorldMapScript
    class, associating it with a specific map ID and assigning it a descriptive name.
    This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    register map-specific scripts that can handle various game events or behaviors
    unique to a particular world map. The name parameter allows for identification
    and debugging purposes, while the mapId parameter ensures the script is correctly
    linked to the intended map within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated character string that serves as the identifier
      name for this WorldMapScript instance. This name is used for logging, debugging,
      and internal referencing purposes.
  - name: mapId
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the
      map to which this script will be associated. Valid values correspond to the
      map IDs defined in the game's database and configuration files.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic WorldMapScript Initialization
    code: WorldMapScript* script = new WorldMapScript("InstanceMapScript", 1234);
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering a Custom Map Script
    code: "class MyCustomMapScript : public WorldMapScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyCustomMapScript()\
      \ : WorldMapScript(\"MyCustomMap\", 530) {}\n};\n\nMyCustomMapScript* customScript\
      \ = new MyCustomMapScript();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by user code but rather
    through the framework's internal registration system. The mapId parameter must
    correspond to a valid map entry in the game's database, otherwise the script may
    not function correctly or could cause runtime errors. It is recommended to use
    predefined map constants or validate the map ID before instantiation.
  warnings: Incorrect map IDs can lead to undefined behavior or crashes when the script
    attempts to interact with non-existent maps. Ensure that the name parameter does
    not contain special characters that might interfere with logging systems. Avoid
    creating multiple instances of WorldMapScript for the same map ID as this may
    cause conflicts in the framework's internal registry.
