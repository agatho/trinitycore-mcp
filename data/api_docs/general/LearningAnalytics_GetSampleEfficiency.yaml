  signature: float LearningAnalytics::GetSampleEfficiency(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the sample efficiency metric for a specified bot based
    on its learning performance.
  description: The GetSampleEfficiency method computes a normalized efficiency score
    for a given bot identified by its GUID. This metric reflects how effectively the
    bot is learning from training samples, taking into account factors such as training
    progress, accuracy improvements, and resource utilization. The returned value
    is typically a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0, where higher values
    indicate better sample efficiency. This method is primarily used in automated
    learning systems or AI-driven gameplay mechanics within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the sample efficiency of the specified bot.
    Values typically range from 0.0 (lowest efficiency) to 1.0 (highest efficiency).
    Returns 0.0 if the bot is not found or has no training data available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      float efficiency = analytics.GetSampleEfficiency(botGuid);

      printf("Bot %u efficiency: %.2f\n", botGuid, efficiency);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Efficiency Threshold Check
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nfloat efficiency = analytics.GetSampleEfficiency(botGuid);\n\
      if (efficiency > 0.8f) {\n    printf(\"Bot is highly efficient\\n\");\n} else\
      \ if (efficiency > 0.5f) {\n    printf(\"Bot is moderately efficient\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Bot needs optimization\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot's learning data has been properly initialized
    and tracked within the LearningAnalytics system. The efficiency calculation may
    involve complex algorithms that consider multiple variables such as training time,
    sample size, and learning rate adjustments.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active bot in the system;
    otherwise, the method will return a default value of 0.0. This method should not
    be called on bots that are currently in a corrupted or uninitialized state.
