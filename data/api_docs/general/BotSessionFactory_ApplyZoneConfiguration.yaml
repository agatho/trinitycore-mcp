  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: ApplyZoneConfiguration
  signature: void BotSessionFactory::ApplyZoneConfiguration(std::shared_ptr<BotSession>
    session, uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Applies zone-specific configuration settings to a bot session based on the
    provided zone identifier.
  description: 'The ApplyZoneConfiguration method configures a bot session according
    to the rules and settings associated with a specific game zone. This function
    is typically invoked when a bot enters a new zone to ensure that its behavior,
    abilities, and actions are adjusted appropriately for the environment. It may
    modify parameters such as spell usage, movement patterns, or combat strategies
    depending on the zone''s characteristics. The method relies on internal zone configuration
    data structures and applies these settings to the provided session object. Precondition:
    The session must be valid and initialized; zoneId should correspond to an existing
    zone in the game world.'
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A shared pointer to the BotSession object that will receive the zone-specific
      configuration. This parameter must not be null.
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone to apply configuration for. Must
      correspond to a valid zone in the game world database.
  returns: None. The method modifies the session object in-place and does not return
    any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSession> botSession = std::make_shared<BotSession>(playerGuid);

      uint32 currentZoneId = player->GetZoneId();

      BotSessionFactory::ApplyZoneConfiguration(botSession, currentZoneId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal zone configuration tables or databases
    to retrieve appropriate settings. It may also trigger additional initialization
    steps for the bot session depending on the zone type (e.g., dungeon, battleground,
    arena). Ensure that the zoneId passed is valid and corresponds to a known zone
    in the game world.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent zoneId could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect bot configuration. Always validate zone IDs before calling this method.
