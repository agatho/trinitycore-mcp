  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: LoadZonesFromDatabase
  signature: void BotWorldPositioner::LoadZonesFromDatabase()
documentation:
  brief: Loads zone data from the database for bot world positioning calculations.
  description: The LoadZonesFromDatabase method retrieves and initializes zone-related
    information from the TrinityCore database, which is essential for determining
    valid bot movement areas and positioning within different zones. This method typically
    executes during server startup or when zone data needs to be refreshed, ensuring
    that bots have accurate geographical context for their AI behaviors. It processes
    zone boundaries, terrain data, and other relevant spatial information necessary
    for proper world positioning logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      positioner.LoadZonesFromDatabase();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during initialization or when zone
    data is known to have changed. It may block execution while querying the database,
    so it's recommended to call it asynchronously or during server loading phases.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper synchronization can lead
    to duplicate data loading and potential memory leaks. Ensure that database connections
    are properly managed to avoid connection pool exhaustion.
