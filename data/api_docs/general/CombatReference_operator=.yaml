documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one CombatReference object to another, performing
    a deep copy of the referenced combat data.
  description: The operator= method implements assignment semantics for the CombatReference
    class, allowing one CombatReference instance to be assigned the contents of another.
    This operation typically involves copying internal references or data structures
    that represent combat-related information such as target references, combat state,
    or damage records. The method ensures proper resource management by handling any
    necessary cleanup of existing resources before copying from the source object.
    In the context of TrinityCore's combat system, this assignment operator is crucial
    for maintaining valid combat references when objects are reassigned during combat
    events or when managing temporary combat states.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source CombatReference object whose contents will be copied to
      this instance. This parameter must be a valid CombatReference object and cannot
      be null.
  returns: A reference to the current CombatReference object (this), allowing for
    chained assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'CombatReference ref1;

      CombatReference ref2 = ref1; // Uses operator=

      // ref2 now contains a copy of all data from ref1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'CombatReference ref1, ref2, ref3;

      ref3 = ref2 = ref1; // Chained assignment using operator=

      // All three references now contain copies of ref1''s data'
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely performs deep copying of internal combat data structures
    to ensure that modifications to one CombatReference do not affect another. This
    method should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as it may involve
    memory allocation and copying of potentially large data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the source CombatReference object is valid before assignment
    to avoid undefined behavior. If the class manages dynamic memory, this operator
    must properly handle self-assignment cases to prevent memory leaks or corruption.
