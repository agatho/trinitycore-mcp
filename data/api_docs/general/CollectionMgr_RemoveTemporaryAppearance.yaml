  class: CollectionMgr
  method: RemoveTemporaryAppearance
  signature: void CollectionMgr::RemoveTemporaryAppearance(Item * item)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a temporary appearance from the specified item.
  description: The RemoveTemporaryAppearance method removes any temporary visual appearance
    modifier that has been applied to the given item. This functionality is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's collection system, where items can temporarily display
    different models or cosmetic appearances without permanently altering the item's
    properties. The method ensures that the item reverts to its original visual state
    by clearing the temporary appearance data associated with it. This operation does
    not affect the item's base properties or its permanent enchantments.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object from which the temporary appearance should
      be removed. Must not be null and must represent a valid item in the player's
      inventory.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Remove Temporary Appearance from an Item
    code: "Item* myItem = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (myItem)\n{\n    sCollectionMgr->RemoveTemporaryAppearance(myItem);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CollectionMgr system which manages item appearances
    and visual modifications in TrinityCore. It's important to ensure that the item
    pointer passed is valid and that the item actually has a temporary appearance
    applied before calling this method, as it may not perform any action if no temporary
    appearance exists.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or null item pointer will result in
    undefined behavior. Always verify that the item exists and is properly initialized
    before invoking RemoveTemporaryAppearance.
