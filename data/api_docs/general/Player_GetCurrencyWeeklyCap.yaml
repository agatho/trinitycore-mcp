  brief: Returns the weekly cap for a specified currency type.
  description: This method retrieves the weekly limit for a given currency type, which
    determines how much of that currency a player can earn or accumulate during the
    current week. It is commonly used in conjunction with currency tracking systems
    to enforce game mechanics such as weekly caps on currency accumulation. The method
    does not require any parameters beyond the currency entry itself and returns a
    uint32 value representing the maximum amount of currency allowed per week.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the maximum weekly cap for the specified currency type, typically
    expressed as a uint32 value indicating how much currency can be accumulated during
    the week.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 weeklyCap = player->GetCurrencyWeeklyCap(currencyEntry);

      // Use weeklyCap to determine if player has reached their limit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the currency system in TrinityCore and relies on internal
    currency data structures. It should be used carefully when checking against actual
    currency amounts to avoid incorrect results.
  warnings: The method may return zero if no weekly cap is defined for the currency
    type, or if the currency entry is invalid. Always verify that the CurrencyTypesEntry
    pointer is valid before calling this method.
