documentation:
  brief: Handles the removal of a creature's corpse and adjusts the respawn delay
    accordingly.
  description: The CorpseRemoved method is invoked when a creature's corpse is removed
    from the game world, typically after the corpse has decayed or been looted. This
    method allows SmartAI implementations to customize the respawn behavior by modifying
    the respawnDelay parameter. It serves as a hook for AI scripts to perform cleanup
    operations or alter the default respawn timing of creatures. The method is part
    of the general AI lifecycle and is called during the creature's death sequence,
    specifically when the corpse is no longer present in the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Respawn Delay Adjustment
    code: "void SmartAI::CorpseRemoved(uint32& respawnDelay)\n{\n    // Extend respawn\
      \ delay by 30 seconds\n    respawnDelay += 30;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Respawn Behavior
    code: "void SmartAI::CorpseRemoved(uint32& respawnDelay)\n{\n    // If the creature\
      \ was killed by a player, double the respawn delay\n    if (GetCreature()->GetKillerGuid().IsPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        respawnDelay *= 2;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the creature's death sequence and should not
    be used for heavy computations as it may affect performance. The respawnDelay
    parameter can be modified to change how long the creature waits before respawning.
  warnings: Modifying the respawnDelay parameter directly affects the game's behavior
    and should be done carefully to avoid unintended consequences such as infinite
    respawns or extremely long delays. Ensure that any modifications are within reasonable
    bounds to maintain game balance.
