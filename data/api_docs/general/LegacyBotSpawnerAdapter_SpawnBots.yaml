  class: LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter
  method: SpawnBots
  signature: uint32 LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::SpawnBots(const int & requests)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a specified number of legacy bots into the game world.
  description: The SpawnBots method is responsible for creating and initializing a
    given number of legacy bots within the World of Warcraft environment. This method
    typically handles the allocation of bot resources, assignment of AI behaviors,
    and integration of the bots into existing game systems such as player groups or
    battlegrounds. It may also manage the spawning process to ensure proper distribution
    across different zones or instances. The method is commonly used in testing environments,
    bot-based gameplay mechanics, or administrative tools for managing NPC populations.
  parameters:
  - name: requests
    description: An integer value specifying the number of legacy bots to spawn. Valid
      values are typically positive integers representing the desired quantity of
      bots to create.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value indicating the actual number of bots successfully
    spawned. This may differ from the requested count if spawning fails due to resource
    constraints, invalid parameters, or system limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawning
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter spawner;

      uint32 spawnedCount = spawner.SpawnBots(5);

      // Spawns 5 legacy bots and returns the actual count spawned'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Bot Spawning Based on Current Population
    code: "LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter spawner;\nint desiredCount = 10;\nuint32 currentSpawned\
      \ = spawner.SpawnBots(desiredCount);\nif (currentSpawned < desiredCount) {\n\
      \    // Handle partial spawning or logging\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal bot management systems and may
    have performance implications when large numbers of bots are spawned simultaneously.
    It's recommended to batch spawn requests or limit concurrent calls to prevent
    system overload.
  warnings: Spawning too many bots at once might cause server lag or resource exhaustion.
    Ensure that the number of requested bots is within acceptable limits for your
    server configuration and available resources.
