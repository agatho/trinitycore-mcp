documentation:
  brief: Optimizes target assignments for group coordination by reassigning targets
    to minimize overlap and maximize efficiency.
  description: The OptimizeTargetAssignments method in the GroupCoordination class
    is responsible for recalculating and adjusting target assignments within a group
    to ensure optimal distribution of tasks. This method evaluates current target
    assignments, identifies potential conflicts or overlaps, and redistributes targets
    among group members to improve overall performance and reduce redundancy. It is
    typically invoked during group composition changes, target availability updates,
    or when performance degradation is detected. The optimization process considers
    factors such as player roles, target difficulty, and group member capabilities
    to achieve balanced load distribution.

  - title: Basic Usage in Group Update Context
    code: "void MyGroupHandler::OnGroupUpdate()\n{\n    groupCoordination->OptimizeTargetAssignments();\n\
      \    // Target assignments are now optimized for current group state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it involves computational overhead
    to evaluate and redistribute targets. It's recommended to batch multiple group
    changes before invoking this optimization. The method assumes that all group members
    have valid target assignment data and that the underlying target system is properly
    initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat or high-frequency updates may
    cause temporary performance degradation. Avoid calling it in tight loops or without
    proper state validation, as it might lead to inconsistent target states.
