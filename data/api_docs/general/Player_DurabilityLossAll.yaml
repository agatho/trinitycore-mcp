documentation:
  brief: Removes all durability from player items and equipment
  description: This method completely removes durability from all items in a player's
    inventory and equipped gear. It is typically used for testing or game master purposes
    to simulate equipment degradation without affecting the actual item quality. The
    method operates on both equipped items and inventory items, making it useful for
    debugging or testing scenarios where complete durability loss is required.
  parameters:
  - name: percent
    description: The percentage of durability to remove from each item. This parameter
      controls how much of the total durability is removed from items.
  - name: inventory
    description: When true, removes durability from all inventory items including
      equipped gear. When false, only removes durability from equipped items.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->DurabilityLossAll(100.0, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->DurabilityLossAll(50.0, false);

      // This removes 50% durability from equipped items only'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: The method likely iterates through all inventory
    slots and equipped items to remove durability. Performance considerations include
    potential impact on server performance when used in large-scale testing scenarios.'
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can cause items to become unusable
    immediately. It may also affect game balance if used inappropriately during gameplay.
