  brief: Removes all area auras from the unit when it leaves the world
  description: This method removes all area of effect auras from the unit, typically
    used when a unit is leaving the world or being removed from the game. It ensures
    that any ongoing area effects are properly cleared and prevents potential issues
    with lingering aura effects after a unit has been removed from play. The method
    is commonly called during unit destruction or when a unit is being removed from
    the world.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a unit is being removed from the world. It ensures proper cleanup of area effects
    and prevents potential memory leaks or lingering effects.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in missing or incorrect removal
    of area auras, leading to visual artifacts or gameplay issues. This method should
    only be called when the unit is actually leaving the world.
