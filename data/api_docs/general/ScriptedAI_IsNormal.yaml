  method: IsNormal
  signature: bool ScriptedAI::IsNormal() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI instance is operating in normal mode, as opposed
    to a special or override state.
  description: The IsNormal method checks if the ScriptedAI instance is currently
    in its standard operational state. This typically indicates that the AI is not
    in a special condition such as being under a spell effect, stunned, feared, or
    otherwise incapacitated. The method returns true when the AI can execute normal
    behavior and false when it's in a restricted state that prevents standard AI actions.
    This check is commonly used within AI scripts to prevent execution of certain
    behaviors during combat states or debuffs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI is in normal operating conditions and can perform
    standard actions; returns false if the AI is in a special or restricted state
    that prevents normal behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n     \
      \   return;\n\n    if (me->IsNormal())\n    {\n        // Execute normal attack\
      \ logic\n        DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        //\
      \ Handle special state behavior\n        DoNothing();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI state checks to
    ensure that actions are only performed when the AI is capable of executing them.
    It's important to note that this check does not account for all possible AI restrictions,
    but rather focuses on core normal operation states.
