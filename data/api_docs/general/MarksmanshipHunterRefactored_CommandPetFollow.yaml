  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::CommandPetFollow()
documentation:
  brief: Commands the hunter's pet to begin following the hunter.
  description: The CommandPetFollow method instructs the hunter's current pet to enter
    a 'follow' state, where it will automatically move alongside the hunter. This
    method is typically invoked when the player issues a 'follow' command through
    the user interface or game mechanics. It ensures that the pet's AI behavior transitions
    from idle or attack modes to a following state, maintaining proximity to the hunter
    while respecting movement constraints and combat conditions. The method does not
    directly control pet movement but rather sets the appropriate AI state for the
    pet to follow.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MarksmanshipHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.CommandPetFollow();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a pet is currently active and controlled by the
    hunter. It relies on the underlying pet AI system to handle actual movement logic.
    The method may have no effect if called when the pet is already in a follow state
    or if the pet is not under the hunter's control.
