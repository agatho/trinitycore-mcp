documentation:
  brief: Records player movement data for pattern recognition analysis
  description: The RecordMovement method captures and stores player movement patterns
    for use in detecting cheating behaviors, such as aimbot usage or macro automation.
    This method is typically invoked during gameplay to log positional data, movement
    speed, and direction changes. The recorded data can be used by the TrinityCore
    anti-cheat system to identify suspicious behavior patterns that deviate from normal
    player movement. The method operates on a per-player basis and maintains internal
    tracking structures for each recognized player.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerUpdate(Player* player, uint32 diff)\n{\n    PlayerPatternRecognition::RecordMovement(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during gameplay to ensure accurate
    pattern recording. The implementation likely uses a circular buffer or similar
    data structure to efficiently store movement samples without excessive memory
    allocation. Performance impact is minimal as it only records movement data and
    does not perform complex computations.
  warnings: Do not call this method excessively in tight loops as it may cause unnecessary
    CPU overhead. Ensure that player pointers are valid before calling to prevent
    null pointer dereferences.
