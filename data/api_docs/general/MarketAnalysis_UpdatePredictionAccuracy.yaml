api:
  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: UpdatePredictionAccuracy
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::UpdatePredictionAccuracy(uint32 itemId, float predictedPrice,
    float actualPrice)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the accuracy metrics for price predictions of a specific item in
    the market analysis system.
  description: The UpdatePredictionAccuracy method is used to record and analyze the
    performance of price prediction models within the MarketAnalysis class. It takes
    an item identifier, a predicted price value, and the actual price at which the
    item was sold or traded. This method calculates the difference between the predicted
    and actual prices to update internal accuracy metrics such as mean absolute error
    or root mean square error. The data collected is used for refining prediction
    algorithms and improving future market forecasts. This method should be called
    whenever a prediction is made and an actual outcome is known, typically after
    an item has been traded on the auction house or in the marketplace.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which the prediction accuracy
      is being updated. This corresponds to the item's entry ID in the game database.
  - name: predictedPrice
    description: The predicted price value generated by the market analysis algorithm
      for the specified item. This should be a positive floating-point number representing
      the expected value in copper coins.
  - name: actualPrice
    description: The real-world price at which the item was actually sold or traded.
      This must be a non-negative floating-point number representing the final transaction
      value in copper coins.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      uint32 itemId = 18732; // Iron Ore

      float predicted = 500.0f;

      float actual = 480.0f;

      analysis.UpdatePredictionAccuracy(itemId, predicted, actual);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction House Events
    code: "void OnAuctionSold(uint32 itemId, uint64 finalPrice)\n{\n    float predicted\
      \ = GetPredictedPrice(itemId);\n    float actual = static_cast<float>(finalPrice);\n\
      \    marketAnalysis.UpdatePredictionAccuracy(itemId, predicted, actual);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the auction house system or market
    data processing modules. It's important to ensure that both predicted and actual
    prices are valid positive values to avoid skewing accuracy metrics. The method
    may internally store historical prediction errors for statistical analysis over
    time.
  warnings: Calling this method with negative price values will result in incorrect
    accuracy calculations. Ensure that the itemId corresponds to a valid item in the
    game database, or the method may not update any meaningful metrics. This method
    does not perform any validation on the input parameters beyond basic type checking.
