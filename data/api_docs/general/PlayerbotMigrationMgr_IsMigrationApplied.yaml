documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific migration version has been applied to the player
    bot system
  description: This method determines if a given migration version has already been
    executed within the player bot migration manager. It is used to track which migrations
    have been successfully applied during the initialization or update process of
    player bot functionality. The method typically checks against an internal record
    or flag set when a migration is completed. This helps prevent duplicate application
    of migrations and ensures system consistency.
  parameters:
  - name: version
    description: The version string identifier of the migration to check for application
      status
  returns: Returns true if the specified migration version has been applied, false
    otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific migration is applied
    code: "if (PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->IsMigrationApplied(\"1.2.3\")) {\n\
      \    // Migration already applied\n    printf(\"Migration 1.2.3 has been applied\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Migration needs to be applied\n    printf(\"Migration\
      \ 1.2.3 has not been applied yet\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during system startup or migration initialization
    to determine which migrations need to be executed. The implementation likely uses
    an internal data structure to track applied versions.
