documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new detected spell cast instance with default values.
  description: The DetectedSpellCast constructor initializes a new instance of the
    DetectedSpellCast class. This method sets up the internal state of the spell cast
    detection mechanism, preparing it for tracking spell casts within the game world.
    The constructor typically initializes member variables to their default states
    and may perform basic setup required for spell detection logic. This is a fundamental
    part of the spell detection system used by TrinityCore's AI and combat mechanics.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new DetectedSpellCast instance
    code: 'DetectedSpellCast spellCast;

      // This creates a new spell cast detection object ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the game engine when spell
    cast detection is needed. Developers should not directly instantiate this class
    unless implementing custom AI or spell detection logic. The initialization process
    may involve memory allocation and setting up internal data structures for tracking
    spell cast information.
