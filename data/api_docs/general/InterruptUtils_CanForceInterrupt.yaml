  class: InterruptUtils
  method: CanForceInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptUtils::CanForceInterrupt(Player * bot, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can force interrupt an enemy unit's spell casting.
  description: The CanForceInterrupt method evaluates if a given player character
    is capable of forcibly interrupting the spell casting of a target unit. This functionality
    is typically used in AI logic to decide when to cast interrupt spells such as
    Silenced or Counterspell. The method checks various conditions including the player's
    ability to interrupt, the target's current spell state, and whether the target
    is currently casting a spell that can be interrupted. It does not perform the
    actual interruption but rather assesses the feasibility of doing so.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI-controlled character
      attempting the interrupt.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell casting
      may be interrupted.
  returns: Returns true if the player can successfully force interrupt the target's
    current spell casting, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (InterruptUtils::CanForceInterrupt(bot, target)) {\n    // Attempt to\
      \ cast an interrupt spell\n    bot->CastSpell(target, INTERRUPT_SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a combat decision tree
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateCombat() {\n    if (CanForceInterrupt(bot, target)) {\n\
      \        // Prioritize interrupting high-priority spells\n        if (target->IsCasting())\
      \ {\n            bot->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SHOCK, true);\n        }\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI framework to make decisions
    about when to use interrupt abilities. It relies on internal game state checks
    such as whether the target is casting a spell that can be interrupted, and if
    the player has sufficient mana or resources to cast an interrupt spell.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. Also note that this function
    only evaluates the ability to interrupt, not whether the actual spell was successfully
    cast.
