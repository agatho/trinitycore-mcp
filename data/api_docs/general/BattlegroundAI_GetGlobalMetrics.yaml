  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: GetGlobalMetrics
  signature: const BGMetrics & BattlegroundAI::GetGlobalMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the global metrics structure for the battleground.
  description: The GetGlobalMetrics method returns a constant reference to the BGMetrics
    structure that contains various statistical and performance-related data for the
    battleground. This structure typically includes information such as player counts,
    team scores, win/loss statistics, and other aggregate metrics relevant to the
    battleground's current state. The returned reference is read-only, ensuring that
    external code cannot modify the internal metrics directly. This method is commonly
    used by battleground AI systems to make decisions based on overall game state
    and performance data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a BGMetrics object containing global statistics
    and metrics for the battleground instance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Global Metrics in Battleground AI
    code: "void MyBattlegroundAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    const BGMetrics& metrics\
      \ = GetGlobalMetrics();\n    if (metrics.TeamScores[TEAM_ALLIANCE] > metrics.TeamScores[TEAM_HORDE])\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle alliance leading logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned BGMetrics reference is valid only during the lifetime of the
    BattlegroundAI instance. Accessing this reference after the battleground has ended
    or been destroyed may result in undefined behavior. The metrics are updated periodically
    by the battleground system and reflect the current state at the time of the call.
