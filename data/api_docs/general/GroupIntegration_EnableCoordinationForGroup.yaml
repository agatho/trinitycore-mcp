  class: GroupIntegration
  method: EnableCoordinationForGroup
  signature: void GroupIntegration::EnableCoordinationForGroup(Group * group, GroupCoordinationMode
    mode)
documentation:
  brief: Enables group coordination for a specified group with the given coordination
    mode.
  description: The EnableCoordinationForGroup method activates group coordination
    functionality for a given group, allowing it to participate in coordinated activities
    such as shared loot distribution, synchronized quest progress, or unified instance
    management. This method configures the group's behavior based on the provided
    GroupCoordinationMode parameter, which determines how the group interacts with
    shared resources and events. The method does not validate whether the group is
    valid or active before enabling coordination, so callers should ensure the group
    pointer is valid. This functionality is typically used in custom scripts or modules
    that extend TrinityCore's default group behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which coordination will be enabled.
      Must not be null, and the group must be a valid active group within the game
      world.
  - name: mode
    description: The GroupCoordinationMode enum value that specifies how the group
      should coordinate. Valid values may include LOOT, QUEST, INSTANCE, or other
      coordination types depending on the implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable loot coordination for a group
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    GroupIntegration::EnableCoordinationForGroup(myGroup,\
      \ GROUP_COORDINATION_LOOT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Enable quest coordination for a group
    code: "Group* party = player->GetGroup();\nif (party && party->IsLeader(player))\n\
      {\n    GroupIntegration::EnableCoordinationForGroup(party, GROUP_COORDINATION_QUEST);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal group state flags and may affect how the group
    interacts with shared game systems. It is recommended to call this only after
    verifying that the group exists and is in a valid state. The coordination mode
    affects all members of the group uniformly.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or null group pointer will likely result
    in a crash or undefined behavior. Always validate the group pointer before calling
    this function. Additionally, enabling coordination may interfere with existing
    group settings if not properly managed.
