  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: ScheduleQueueUpdate
  signature: void BattlegroundMgr::ScheduleQueueUpdate(uint32 arenaMatchmakerRating,
    int bgQueueTypeId, int bracket_id)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules an update to the battleground queue for the specified arena matchmaker
    rating and bracket.
  description: The ScheduleQueueUpdate method is responsible for triggering an asynchronous
    update to the battleground queue system. This function is typically invoked when
    queue state changes need to be processed, such as when a player joins or leaves
    a queue, or when matchmaking parameters are updated. It schedules the actual queue
    processing to occur at a later time, allowing the system to batch multiple updates
    together for efficiency. The method takes into account the arena matchmaker rating,
    which influences how players are matched in rated battlegrounds, and the bracket
    ID which determines the skill level range of the queue.
  parameters:
  - name: arenaMatchmakerRating
    description: The matchmaker rating used for determining player matchmaking in
      arena queues. This value affects how players are grouped together based on their
      skill levels.
  - name: bgQueueTypeId
    description: Identifier for the battleground queue type. This determines which
      specific queue (e.g., 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 5v5) is being updated.
  - name: bracket_id
    description: The bracket identifier that defines the skill level range for the
      queue update. This helps categorize players into appropriate matchmaking groups.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Queue Update Scheduling
    code: BattlegroundMgr::instance()->ScheduleQueueUpdate(1500, BG_QUEUE_3v3, 2);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Arena Queue with Matchmaker Rating
    code: 'uint32 rating = player->GetArenaTeamRating(0);

      BattlegroundMgr::instance()->ScheduleQueueUpdate(rating, BG_QUEUE_5v5, 4);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform immediate queue processing; it only schedules
    the update. The actual queue handling occurs asynchronously in the game loop.
    It's important to ensure that the provided parameters are valid to avoid unexpected
    behavior during matchmaking.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (e.g., negative matchmaker
    rating or invalid bracket ID) may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect matchmaking
    results. Ensure proper validation before calling this function.
