  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: GetTimeToComplete
  signature: uint32 InterruptRotationManager::GetTimeToComplete(const ActiveCast &
    cast) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the time required to complete an active cast interrupting the
    current rotation.
  description: The GetTimeToComplete method determines how long it will take to finish
    executing a given active cast, which is typically used in interrupt rotation management
    logic. This calculation considers factors such as spell casting time, channel
    duration, and any modifiers that might affect the completion time. The method
    is essential for AI decision-making when determining whether to interrupt or continue
    with a current rotation based on timing constraints. It assumes that the provided
    cast object is valid and represents an ongoing or pending spell execution within
    the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the time in milliseconds needed to
    complete the specified active cast. A return value of zero typically indicates
    either an invalid cast or immediate completion, while higher values represent
    longer casting or channeling durations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 timeToComplete = interruptRotationManager->GetTimeToComplete(activeCast);\n\
      if (timeToComplete < 1000)\n{\n    // Interrupt the current rotation if less\
      \ than 1 second remains\n    interruptRotationManager->InterruptCurrentRotation();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal timing systems and spell data
    structures within TrinityCore. It may cache or precompute certain values for performance
    optimization, especially in high-frequency AI decision contexts.
