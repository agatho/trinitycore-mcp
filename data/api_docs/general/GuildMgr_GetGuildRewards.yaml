  class: GuildMgr
  method: GetGuildRewards
  signature: const int & GuildMgr::GetGuildRewards() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reward identifier associated with a guild.
  description: The GetGuildRewards method returns a constant reference to an integer
    representing the reward ID linked to the guild. This value is typically used in
    the context of guild achievements or rewards systems within World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework. The returned reference allows for efficient access without
    copying the underlying data. It is expected that this method will be called in
    scenarios where guild-specific rewards need to be evaluated or applied, such as
    during quest completion or achievement unlocking events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the guild's reward identifier.
    This value corresponds to a specific reward entry in the game's database and is
    used to determine which rewards should be granted to members of the guild.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int rewardId = guildMgr->GetGuildRewards();\n// Use rewardId to apply or\
      \ check guild rewards\nif (rewardId > 0)\n{\n    // Apply reward logic here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, meaning the returned value should
    not be modified directly. The underlying integer is likely initialized during
    guild creation or loading from the database and may change based on guild progression
    or events.
  warnings: Ensure that the GuildMgr instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing rewards on an uninitialized or invalid guild context
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect reward assignments.
