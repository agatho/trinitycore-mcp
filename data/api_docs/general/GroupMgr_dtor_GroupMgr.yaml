  signature: void GroupMgr::~GroupMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GroupMgr instance and cleans up all associated group data and
    resources.
  description: The ~GroupMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    memory and resources allocated by the GroupMgr class. This includes removing all
    active groups, releasing references to players in groups, and ensuring no dangling
    pointers or memory leaks occur. The destructor is automatically invoked when a
    GroupMgr object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that all
    group-related data structures are properly dismantled before the object is fully
    destroyed. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method
    plays a critical role in maintaining server stability during shutdown or when
    group management systems need to be reset.

  - title: Automatic destruction of GroupMgr instance
    code: "void CleanupGroupManager()\n{\n    // GroupMgr is created on stack\n  \
      \  GroupMgr groupMgr;\n    // When function ends, destructor is automatically\
      \ called\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless the GroupMgr object was
    dynamically allocated. It's important to ensure that no references to groups or
    players remain after destruction to prevent memory corruption. The implementation
    likely handles cleanup of group instances, player references, and internal data
    structures.
