  class: QuestPickup
  method: GetBotPickupMetrics
  signature: QuestPickupMetrics QuestPickup::GetBotPickupMetrics(uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves pickup metrics for a specific bot GUID from the quest pickup system.
  description: The GetBotPickupMetrics method retrieves detailed statistics and tracking
    data related to quest pickups performed by a specific bot within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method is typically used in automated questing systems or botting
    frameworks to monitor and analyze how bots interact with quest objectives. The
    returned QuestPickupMetrics object contains various performance indicators, such
    as pickup times, success rates, and other relevant metrics that help developers
    understand bot behavior in quest scenarios. This functionality is particularly
    useful for debugging quest-related automation scripts or optimizing bot performance
    in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose pickup metrics are
      to be retrieved. This should be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer representing
      a player or NPC GUID within the TrinityCore database.
  returns: A QuestPickupMetrics object containing detailed statistics about quest
    pickups performed by the specified bot, including timing data, success/failure
    counts, and other performance indicators. Returns an empty or default-initialized
    metrics object if no data exists for the given bot GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve bot pickup metrics
    code: 'uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      QuestPickupMetrics metrics = questPickup->GetBotPickupMetrics(botGuid);

      // Use metrics for analysis or logging

      std::cout << "Pickups: " << metrics.totalPickups << ", Success Rate: " << metrics.successRate
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using bot pickup metrics to monitor quest automation performance
    code: "void MonitorBotPerformance(uint32 botGuid) {\n    QuestPickupMetrics metrics\
      \ = questPickup->GetBotPickupMetrics(botGuid);\n    if (metrics.totalPickups\
      \ > 0) {\n        float successPercentage = (metrics.successfulPickups / static_cast<float>(metrics.totalPickups))\
      \ * 100;\n        printf(\"Bot %u: %.2f%% successful pickups\\n\", botGuid,\
      \ successPercentage);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"No pickup data available\
      \ for bot %u\\n\", botGuid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the QuestPickup system has been properly initialized
    and that the provided bot GUID corresponds to an existing entity in the game world.
    The returned metrics may be cached or updated asynchronously depending on the
    internal implementation of the QuestPickup class. Developers should ensure thread
    safety when accessing this method from multiple threads.
  warnings: The method may return default-initialized metrics if no data exists for
    the specified bot GUID, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about bot performance
    if not properly validated. Additionally, relying solely on pickup metrics without
    considering other factors like quest completion times or NPC interaction behaviors
    might provide an incomplete picture of bot effectiveness.
