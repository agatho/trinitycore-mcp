  class: BotMovementUtil
  method: ChaseTarget
  signature: bool BotMovementUtil::ChaseTarget(int * bot, int * target, float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a bot to chase a target unit within a specified distance.
  description: The ChaseTarget method controls a bot's movement behavior to follow
    a designated target unit. It attempts to move the bot towards the target while
    maintaining a specific distance. The method returns true if the bot successfully
    begins chasing the target, or false if the operation fails due to invalid parameters
    or other conditions. This functionality is commonly used in AI-driven bot behavior
    for combat and quest-related activities within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot's identifier or object reference that will initiate
      chasing.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit's identifier or object reference that
      the bot will chase.
  - name: distance
    description: The maximum distance the bot should maintain from the target during
      the chase.
  returns: Returns true if the bot successfully begins chasing the target within the
    specified distance; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chase Target Usage
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint targetId = 67890;\nfloat chaseDistance = 10.0f;\n\
      bool result = BotMovementUtil::ChaseTarget(&botId, &targetId, chaseDistance);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Bot started chasing the target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both bot and target are valid units within the game
    world. The distance parameter should be a positive value; negative values may
    lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method, otherwise the behavior is undefined. Also, if the target unit is out of
    range or becomes invalid during the chase, the bot may stop moving or behave unexpectedly.
