  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: ShouldTeleportToLeader
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::ShouldTeleportToLeader(Player * bot, Player
    * leader)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot should teleport to its leader based on distance
    and combat status.
  description: The ShouldTeleportToLeader method evaluates if a player bot should
    initiate a teleportation action to rejoin its leader. This decision is typically
    made in follow behavior logic where the bot assesses various conditions such as
    distance from the leader, whether either player is in combat, and other contextual
    factors that may affect the bot's ability or desire to remain close. The method
    returns true when teleportation is recommended, and false otherwise. It is commonly
    used within AI systems for managing group dynamics in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that may need to
      teleport.
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the leader to which the
      bot might teleport.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should teleport to the leader; otherwise returns
    false. Conditions influencing this decision include distance thresholds, combat
    states, and other AI-related settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior->ShouldTeleportToLeader(bot, leader)) {\n    bot->TeleportTo(leader->GetMapId(),\
      \ leader->GetPositionX(), leader->GetPositionY(), leader->GetPositionZ(), 0);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state checks
    code: "bool shouldTeleport = leaderFollowBehavior->ShouldTeleportToLeader(bot,\
      \ leader);\nif (shouldTeleport && !bot->IsInCombat() && !leader->IsInCombat())\
      \ {\n    bot->TeleportTo(leader->GetMapId(), leader->GetPositionX(), leader->GetPositionY(),\
      \ leader->GetPositionZ(), 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI behavior system and relies on internal state
    tracking for distance calculations and combat status. It may be called frequently
    during bot updates, so performance considerations are important in high-frequency
    scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure both player pointers are valid before calling this method to avoid
    null pointer dereferences. The teleportation decision is based on predefined thresholds
    which might not always align with desired gameplay behavior.
