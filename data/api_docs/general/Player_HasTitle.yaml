  class: Player
  method: HasTitle
  signature: bool Player::HasTitle(const CharTitlesEntry * title) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has a specific title.
  description: The HasTitle method determines whether a player possesses a particular
    CharTitlesEntry, which represents a game title such as 'First Sergeant' or 'Lieutenant
    Colonel'. This method is commonly used in gameplay logic to verify title availability
    for various actions, including quest completion, achievement unlocking, or character
    progression. The method returns true if the player has the specified title and
    false otherwise. It operates on the player's current title collection, which includes
    titles earned through achievements, quests, or other game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has the specified title, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for a specific title
    code: "if (player->HasTitle(titleEntry)) {\n    // Player has the title\n}\nelse\
      \ {\n    // Player does not have the title\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other title-related methods
    such as AddTitle or RemoveTitle. Performance considerations are minimal as this
    method only checks against a player's current title collection without any complex
    operations.
  warnings: The method does not validate if the CharTitlesEntry passed is valid or
    exists; it simply checks whether the player has that specific title. If an invalid
    title entry is passed, the result will be false, which may lead to unexpected
    behavior in gameplay logic.
