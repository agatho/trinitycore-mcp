  class: BuyerConfiguration
  method: Initialize
  signature: void BuyerConfiguration::Initialize(AuctionHouseType houseType)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the buyer configuration for the specified auction house type.
  description: The Initialize method sets up internal state and configurations required
    for a buyer to operate within a specific auction house type. This includes initializing
    data structures, loading relevant settings, and preparing the system for processing
    auction house transactions. The method must be called before any other buyer operations
    can be performed for the given auction house type. It ensures that all necessary
    resources are allocated and configured correctly based on the provided auction
    house type parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: houseType
    description: Specifies the type of auction house to initialize configuration for.
      Valid values correspond to AuctionHouseType enumeration values such as AH_TYPE_NORMAL,
      AH_TYPE_GUILD, or AH_TYPE_AUCTIONEER.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BuyerConfiguration buyerConfig;

      buyerConfig.Initialize(AH_TYPE_NORMAL);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Guild Auction House
    code: 'BuyerConfiguration guildBuyerConfig;

      guildBuyerConfig.Initialize(AH_TYPE_GUILD);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per BuyerConfiguration instance. Subsequent
    calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The initialization process
    is not thread-safe and should be performed on the main game thread.
  warnings: Calling Initialize without proper setup of the auction house system may
    lead to runtime errors. Ensure that the AuctionHouseType parameter corresponds
    to a valid, active auction house before calling this method.
