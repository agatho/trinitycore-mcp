documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's rating based on the provided combat rating value
  description: The UpdateRating method is used to update a player's combat rating
    in the TrinityCore framework. This method typically handles recalculating and
    applying changes to player statistics such as hit chance, critical strike chance,
    or other combat-related metrics that are influenced by combat ratings. The method
    likely triggers updates to the player's stats, sends relevant updates to the client,
    and may adjust related performance indicators within the game mechanics system.
    It is commonly invoked when a player gains or loses combat rating points through
    various in-game activities such as PvP combat, quest rewards, or equipment changes.
  parameters:
  - name: cr
    description: The combat rating value to update. This parameter represents the
      combat rating adjustment that should be applied to the player's current rating.
      The value can be positive or negative depending on whether the player is gaining
      or losing rating points.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update player's combat rating by adding 50 points
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateRating(50);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove 25 points from player's combat rating
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateRating(-25);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal recalculations of player statistics
    and may send updates to the client via network packets. It should only be called
    when the combat rating value is actually modified, as unnecessary calls could
    impact performance. The method may internally handle synchronization with the
    database or other subsystems.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or extreme values may cause unexpected
    behavior in player statistics or UI display. Ensure that any rating changes are
    within reasonable bounds and properly validated before calling this method.
