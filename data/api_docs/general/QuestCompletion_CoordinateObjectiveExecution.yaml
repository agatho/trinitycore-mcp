  class: QuestCompletion

  signature: void QuestCompletion::CoordinateObjectiveExecution(Group * group, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates execution of a quest objective for all members of a group
  description: The CoordinateObjectiveExecution method handles the synchronization
    and execution of quest objectives within a group context. It ensures that when
    a quest objective is completed by one group member, the necessary updates and
    validations are propagated to all other group members. This method is crucial
    for maintaining consistency in group-based quest progress and handling shared
    objectives such as killing creatures, collecting items, or reaching specific locations.
    The method operates on a specified quest ID and objective index within that quest,
    ensuring proper coordination across all players in the provided group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will participate
      in the quest objective execution. Must not be null and should represent a valid
      group with active members.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the objective is being executed.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index of the specific objective within the quest that needs execution.
      Zero-based indexing, must be less than the total number of objectives in the
      specified quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Quest Objective Execution
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    QuestCompletion::CoordinateObjectiveExecution(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing Objective with Validation
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && questId > 0)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ objectiveIndex = GetQuestObjectiveIndex(questId, \"KillGoblins\");\n    if\
      \ (objectiveIndex != MAX_QUEST_OBJECTIVES)\n    {\n        QuestCompletion::CoordinateObjectiveExecution(group,\
      \ questId, objectiveIndex);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all group members are within the same zone and have
    the quest active. It may trigger internal quest update events and could potentially
    modify player states such as quest progress or objective completion status. The
    method does not validate if the group is in a valid state for quest progression,
    so callers should ensure proper context before invocation.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid questId or objectiveIndex can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the quest exists and the
    objective index is within bounds before calling. Additionally, this method may
    cause network traffic as it synchronizes progress across all group members, so
    use judiciously in performance-critical code paths.
