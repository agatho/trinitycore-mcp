  class: DPSPositioning
  method: AvoidFrontalCleaves
  signature: void DPSPositioning::AvoidFrontalCleaves(Player * dps, Unit * target,
    float cleaveAngle)
documentation:
  brief: Positions a DPS player to avoid frontal cleave attacks from a target unit.
  description: The AvoidFrontalCleaves method adjusts the positioning of a designated
    DPS player to minimize exposure to frontal cleave abilities. This method calculates
    an optimal escape path or positioning strategy based on the target's orientation
    and the specified cleave angle, ensuring that the DPS remains outside the dangerous
    frontal cone of attack. It is typically used in encounter scripting or AI behavior
    to improve survivability during boss fights where frontal cleaves are a primary
    mechanic. The method modifies the player's movement or stance to avoid being caught
    in the cleave's impact area.
  parameters:
  - name: dps
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the DPS character that
      needs to be repositioned.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target unit (e.g., boss)
      that is casting the cleave attack.
  - name: cleaveAngle
    description: Float value indicating the angular width of the frontal cleave in
      degrees. For example, a value of 90.0f represents a 90-degree frontal cone.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Script
    code: "void OnBossCleaveCast(Player* player, Unit* boss)\n{\n    float cleaveAngle\
      \ = 90.0f;\n    DPSPositioning::AvoidFrontalCleaves(player, boss, cleaveAngle);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Cleave Angle Based on Boss Ability
    code: "void OnBossSpecialAbility(Player* player, Unit* boss)\n{\n    float cleaveAngle\
      \ = boss->GetMeleeDamageBonus(); // Example dynamic angle\n    DPSPositioning::AvoidFrontalCleaves(player,\
      \ boss, cleaveAngle);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the target unit has a defined orientation and that the
    cleave is a frontal cone attack. The positioning logic may involve movement commands
    or adjustments to the player's facing direction. Performance impact is minimal
    as it only performs calculations when invoked.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'dps' and 'target' parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, otherwise undefined behavior will occur. Also, be cautious
    of using this in high-frequency loops or without proper cooldowns to avoid overloading
    the AI system.
