documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the CalendarMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the CalendarMgr
    class, providing global access to the calendar management system. This method
    ensures that only one instance of CalendarMgr exists throughout the TrinityCore
    server lifecycle. The returned pointer can be used to access all calendar-related
    functionality such as event creation, invitation management, and calendar synchronization.
    This is a thread-safe implementation that guarantees consistent access to the
    calendar subsystem from any part of the codebase.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of CalendarMgr. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Calendar Manager for Event Creation
    code: 'CalendarMgr* calendar = CalendarMgr::instance();

      CalendarEvent event;

      event.SetTitle("Guild Meeting");

      event.SetType(CALENDAR_EVENT_TYPE_GUILD);

      calendar->AddEvent(&event);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Calendar Event Invitations
    code: "CalendarMgr* calendar = CalendarMgr::instance();\nuint64 eventId = 12345;\n\
      CalendarInvite const* invite = calendar->GetInvite(eventId, 67890);\nif (invite)\n\
      {\n    // Process invitation\n    sWorld->SendNotification(\"You have been invited\
      \ to an event\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is implemented as a standard singleton pattern with lazy initialization.
    The CalendarMgr instance is created during server startup and destroyed at shutdown.
    It's designed to be called frequently throughout the codebase, so performance
    impact is minimal.
