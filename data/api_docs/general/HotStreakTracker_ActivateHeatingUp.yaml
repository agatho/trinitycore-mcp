  signature: void HotStreakTracker::ActivateHeatingUp()
documentation:
  brief: Activates the heating up state for the HotStreakTracker, initiating the process
    of building up hot streak effects.
  description: The ActivateHeatingUp method is responsible for triggering the heating
    up phase within the HotStreakTracker class. This typically occurs when a spell
    or ability that contributes to a hot streak effect is cast or applied. The method
    likely sets internal flags or timers to indicate that the hot streak is in progress,
    preparing the system for subsequent actions such as applying damage bonuses or
    increasing critical strike chance. It may also reset cooldowns or update tracking
    variables related to the hot streak mechanics. This method is generally called
    during spell execution or effect application within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect
    code: "void FireballSpell::EffectExecute(Unit* caster, Unit* target)\n{\n    //\
      \ Apply fireball damage\n    caster->DealDamage(target, damage);\n    \n   \
      \ // Activate heating up for hot streak\n    if (caster->HasAura(SPELL_HOT_STREAK_AURA))\n\
      \    {\n        HotStreakTracker* tracker = caster->GetHotStreakTracker();\n\
      \        tracker->ActivateHeatingUp();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger hot streak system that tracks spell
    casting sequences and applies bonuses based on consecutive successful casts. The
    implementation may involve internal state management to track how many spells
    have been cast in sequence, and when the heating up phase should be activated.
  warnings: Ensure this method is only called when appropriate for the hot streak
    mechanic - calling it outside of valid spell contexts may lead to incorrect behavior
    or unexpected bonuses being applied.
