documentation:
  brief: Prepares a spell for casting by validating targets and checking prerequisites
  description: The prepare method validates the spell's target requirements and checks
    if the spell can be cast under current conditions. It verifies that the targets
    are valid, checks for any aura effects that might prevent casting, and ensures
    the spell meets all prerequisites before proceeding with the actual casting process.
    This method is typically called during spell preparation phase to ensure proper
    execution of spell mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: targets
    description: The SpellCastTargets object containing target information for the
      spell being prepared. This includes target type, unit, item, or other relevant
      parameters that define where and how the spell should be cast.
  - name: triggeredByAura
    description: Optional aura effect that triggered this spell preparation. Used
      to determine if the spell is being cast as part of an aura effect, which can
      influence casting behavior and validation rules.
  returns: Returns SpellCastResult indicating whether the spell preparation was successful
    or if any errors occurred. Possible values include SPELL_CAST_OK, SPELL_CAST_ERROR,
    SPELL_CAST_FAILED, etc., depending on validation results.
  examples:
  - title: Basic spell preparation example
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell.Prepare(target, nullptr);\nif (result ==\
      \ SPELL_CAST_OK)\n{\n    // Proceed with casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Aura-triggered spell preparation example
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spell.Prepare(target, aura);\nif (result == SPELL_CAST_OK)\n\
      {\n    // Continue with spell execution\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error condition\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs validation checks on targets and prerequisites before
    allowing the spell to proceed. It should be called before any actual spell casting
    occurs, and typically involves checking for valid target types, aura restrictions,
    and other conditions that may prevent successful casting.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases; it's usually
    invoked automatically during spell execution. Calling it manually without proper
    context can lead to incorrect validation results or unexpected behavior.
