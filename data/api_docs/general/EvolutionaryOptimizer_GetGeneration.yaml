  class: EvolutionaryOptimizer
  method: GetGeneration
  signature: uint32_t EvolutionaryOptimizer::GetGeneration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current generation number of the evolutionary optimization process
  description: The GetGeneration method retrieves the current generation count from
    an EvolutionaryOptimizer instance. This value represents how many iterations of
    the evolutionary algorithm have been completed. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, this would typically be used in AI systems or simulation frameworks
    where evolutionary algorithms are employed for behavior optimization or genetic
    programming. The generation number is incremented each time a new population is
    created through selection, crossover, and mutation operations. This method provides
    insight into the progress of ongoing evolutionary computations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32_t value representing the current generation number. This value
    starts at 0 or 1 depending on implementation and increments with each completed
    generation cycle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t currentGen = optimizer.GetGeneration();

      TC_LOG_INFO("ai", "Current generation: %u", currentGen);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Evolution Progress
    code: "void MonitorEvolution(EvolutionaryOptimizer& optimizer) {\n    uint32_t\
      \ gen = optimizer.GetGeneration();\n    if (gen % 100 == 0) {\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      ai\", \"Progress update: Generation %u completed\", gen);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically a read-only accessor that does not modify internal
    state. The generation counter may be reset or modified by other methods in the
    class such as Reset() or AdvanceGeneration(). Implementation details may vary
    based on whether this is used for AI behavior trees, genetic algorithms, or simulation
    optimization systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the EvolutionaryOptimizer instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method. If called on an uninitialized or improperly configured
    optimizer, the returned value may be unpredictable or represent an invalid state.
