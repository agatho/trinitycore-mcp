  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::SellExcessMaterials(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Sells excess materials for a player's professions, removing items that exceed
    the maximum allowed quantity.
  description: The SellExcessMaterials method is responsible for managing a player's
    profession-related inventory by identifying and selling any excess materials that
    have been accumulated beyond the maximum allowable limit. This functionality helps
    maintain optimal inventory space and prevents players from hoarding excessive
    resources. The method typically operates within the context of auction house or
    crafting systems where material management is critical. It processes the player's
    current inventory, determines which items exceed quantity thresholds, and executes
    sales for those excess items to free up space and potentially generate gold.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void SellExcessMaterials(int* player)\n{\n    // Implementation would iterate\
      \ through player's profession materials\n    // and sell any items exceeding\
      \ maximum allowed quantities\n    // This is a simplified representation of\
      \ what the method does\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's inventory system and may trigger
    auction house updates or crafting queue modifications. It should be called periodically
    or when inventory thresholds are reached to maintain optimal resource management.
  warnings: Improper implementation could lead to loss of valuable items or incorrect
    quantity calculations. The method should only operate on materials that are actually
    excess, not on items required for crafting or other essential purposes.
