  class: SkillInfo
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void SkillInfo::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes skill information to a data buffer for player creation.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes skill data from a SkillInfo object
    into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for transmission to a client when creating or
    updating a player's skill state. This method is typically used during player initialization
    or when sending skill updates over the network protocol. The serialization includes
    all relevant skill attributes such as skill level, maximum value, and any associated
    modifiers. It requires both an owner (the player who owns the skills) and a receiver
    (the player who will receive the data), although the exact usage may vary depending
    on the context of the packet being constructed.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized skill data will
      be written. This buffer is typically used for constructing network packets.
  - name: owner
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose skill information is being serialized.
      This represents the source of the skill data.
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object who will receive this skill data.
      Used for determining visibility or filtering of skill information during serialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player creation context
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // some player instance

      Player* receiver = ...; // another player instance

      SkillInfo skillInfo;

      skillInfo.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's network packet handling system and
    should only be called when constructing packets for sending to clients. The data
    buffer must be properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that both owner and receiver pointers are valid; otherwise, accessing
    invalid memory may occur. This method does not perform any validation on the input
    parameters beyond basic pointer checks.
