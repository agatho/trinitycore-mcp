documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and state reset operations when combat ends for a Fury Warrior
    AI
  description: The OnCombatEndSpecific method is called when a Fury Warrior AI character
    exits combat mode. This method handles necessary cleanup tasks such as resetting
    combat-related flags, clearing temporary buffs or debuffs, and ensuring the AI
    returns to its default non-combat state. The method ensures that the warrior's
    behavior is properly reset after combat, preventing any lingering effects from
    affecting future encounters. It typically resets internal state variables and
    may trigger additional logic for cooldown management or resource restoration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat End Scenario
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::OnCombatEndSpecific()\n{\n    // Reset combat\
      \ flags\n    _isInCombat = false;\n    \n    // Clear any active combat effects\n\
      \    RemoveAura(SPELL_BLOODTHIRST);\n    RemoveAura(SPELL_SLAM);\n    \n   \
      \ // Reset internal state\n    _comboPoints = 0;\n    _lastAttackTime = 0;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when exiting combat to ensure proper AI
    state management. It's typically invoked by the core combat system when the warrior's
    combat timer expires or when all enemies are defeated.
  warnings: Ensure that all combat-related resources are properly cleaned up in this
    method to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior during subsequent encounters.
