  signature: bool PlayerAI::IsHealer(const int * who) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is classified as a healer class.
  description: The IsHealer method checks if the player's current class is categorized
    as a healing class within the TrinityCore framework. This method evaluates the
    player's class type and returns true if the class is recognized as a healer (such
    as Priest, Druid, Paladin, or Shaman), and false otherwise. The check is typically
    used in AI behavior logic to determine appropriate actions for healing-oriented
    characters. This functionality is crucial for AI decision-making systems that
    need to differentiate between damage-dealing and support roles.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Optional pointer to a player object to check. If null, the method
      checks the current PlayerAI instance's associated player.
  returns: Returns true if the player is classified as a healer class (Priest, Druid,
    Paladin, or Shaman), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if player is a healer
    code: "if (playerAI->IsHealer()) {\n    // Player is a healer, perform healing\
      \ logic\n    playerAI->DoHeal();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with specific player reference
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // some player object\nif (playerAI->IsHealer(&targetPlayer->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n    // Target is a healer, adjust AI behavior accordingly\n    playerAI->SetTargetToHeal(targetPlayer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on class type enumeration and may need to be updated if
    new healer classes are added to the game. The implementation likely uses internal
    class flags or enums rather than string comparisons for performance reasons.
  warnings: The parameter 'who' is marked as const int*, which suggests it might be
    a GUID or similar identifier. Ensure proper handling of this parameter to avoid
    unexpected behavior when checking different player instances.
