  brief: Moves a creature group object to another, transferring ownership of its resources
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on a CreatureGroup
    object, transferring all resources and state from the source object to the target
    object. This is a move operation that leaves the source object in a valid but
    unspecified state. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method allows
    efficient transfer of creature group data without unnecessary copying, which is
    particularly important for managing dynamic groups of creatures during combat
    or patrol behaviors. The move assignment ensures that any existing resources in
    the target are properly cleaned up before the new resources are transferred.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the CreatureGroup object after the move assignment has been
    completed, allowing for method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'CreatureGroup group1;

      CreatureGroup group2 = std::move(group1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      group1 = std::move(group2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in AI Context
    code: "void UpdateCreatureGroup(CreatureGroup& oldGroup, CreatureGroup& newGroup)\
      \ {\n    // Transfer group data to new group\n    newGroup = std::move(oldGroup);\n\
      \    // oldGroup is now in a valid but unspecified state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which is crucial for performance optimization
    when dealing with large collections of creature groups. The source object after
    move assignment should not be used until reinitialized, as it may contain invalid
    or undefined state.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move assignment can lead to undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that any references or pointers to the source object are
    not used afterward. This method assumes the objects are in valid states for move
    operations.
