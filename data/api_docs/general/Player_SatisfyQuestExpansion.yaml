  signature: bool Player::SatisfyQuestExpansion(const Quest * qInfo, bool msg) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player satisfies the expansion requirements for a quest.
  description: This method determines whether a player meets the prerequisites required
    to accept and complete a specific quest. It evaluates the quest's expansion requirements,
    including level ranges, faction requirements, and other conditions that must be
    satisfied before the quest can be accepted or completed. The method returns true
    if all expansion requirements are met, false otherwise. This is particularly important
    for quests that require specific player levels or faction standings to progress.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing the expansion requirements
      to be checked. This parameter defines the quest whose expansion requirements
      will be evaluated.
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to display messages to the player
      if requirements are not met. If true, messages will be shown; if false, no messages
      will be displayed.
  returns: Returns true if all expansion requirements for the quest are satisfied
    by the player, false otherwise. This indicates whether the player can proceed
    with the quest based on expansion criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->SatisfyQuestExpansion(quest, true)) {\n    // Player can accept\
      \ and complete the quest\n    // Proceed with quest logic\n}\nelse {\n    //\
      \ Player cannot proceed with quest\n    // Display appropriate message to player\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally checks various expansion requirements including player
    level, faction requirements, and other game mechanics. It's important to note
    that this method does not actually accept or complete the quest; it only evaluates
    whether the player meets the expansion criteria.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may affect quest progression
    and player experience. If used incorrectly, it could prevent players from accessing
    quests they should be able to access, or conversely, allow players to access quests
    they shouldn't be able to access.
