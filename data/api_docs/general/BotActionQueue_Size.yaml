  signature: size_t BotActionQueue::Size() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of bot actions currently queued for execution
  description: The Size method retrieves the current count of bot actions stored in
    the BotActionQueue. This queue manages a list of pending actions that bots will
    execute in sequence. The returned size indicates how many actions are waiting
    to be processed, which can be useful for monitoring bot activity, debugging, or
    implementing queue-based logic. The method is thread-safe and provides an atomic
    read of the queue's current state without modifying any internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the number of actions currently queued for
    bot execution. Returns 0 if the queue is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Check Queue Size Before Adding Actions
    code: "BotActionQueue queue;\n// Add some actions to the queue\nqueue.AddAction(std::make_shared<MoveAction>(position));\n\
      queue.AddAction(std::make_shared<AttackAction>(target));\n\nsize_t currentSize\
      \ = queue.Size();\nif (currentSize > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot has \" <<\
      \ currentSize << \" actions queued\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitor Queue Length for Performance
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void MonitorQueues() {\n        for (auto&\
      \ bot : bots_) {\n            size_t queueSize = bot->GetActionQueue()->Size();\n\
      \            if (queueSize > 10) {\n                // Log warning about long\
      \ queue\n                LOG_WARN(\"Bot queue is long: %zu actions queued\"\
      , queueSize);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a constant-time operation (O(1)) as it typically returns
    a cached value or uses atomic operations to read the queue size. The implementation
    may use std::atomic<size_t> or similar thread-safe constructs internally to ensure
    consistency across multiple threads accessing the queue simultaneously.
