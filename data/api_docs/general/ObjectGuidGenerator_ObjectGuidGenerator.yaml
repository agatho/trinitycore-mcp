  class: ObjectGuidGenerator
  method: ObjectGuidGenerator
  signature: void ObjectGuidGenerator::ObjectGuidGenerator(HighGuid high, ObjectGuid::LowType
    start)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ObjectGuidGenerator with the specified high GUID type and
    starting low GUID value.
  description: The ObjectGuidGenerator constructor initializes a generator object
    that is responsible for creating unique global identifiers (GUIDs) for game objects.
    It takes a HighGuid parameter which defines the category of objects this generator
    will produce (such as players, creatures, game objects, etc.), and a starting
    LowType value which sets where the low portion of the GUID sequence begins. This
    allows for proper organization and separation of different types of game entities
    within the TrinityCore database system. The generator maintains internal state
    to ensure that each generated GUID is unique within its high GUID category.
  parameters:
  - name: high
    description: The HighGuid enum value specifying the type of objects this generator
      will create GUIDs for (e.g., HIGHGUID_PLAYER, HIGHGUID_UNIT, HIGHGUID_GAMEOBJECT).
      This determines the upper portion of the GUID that identifies the object type.
  - name: start
    description: The starting LowType value for the low portion of the generated GUIDs.
      This value represents where the sequence begins for this particular generator
      instance and must be a valid unsigned 32-bit integer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Player GUID Generator
    code: 'ObjectGuidGenerator playerGenerator(HIGHGUID_PLAYER, 1);

      // Creates a generator for player GUIDs starting at 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize Creature GUID Generator
    code: 'ObjectGuidGenerator creatureGenerator(HIGHGUID_UNIT, 100000);

      // Creates a generator for creature GUIDs starting at 100000'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore server during
    initialization to set up generators for different object types. The start value
    should be chosen carefully to avoid conflicts with existing database entries and
    to maintain proper ordering of GUIDs. Each generator maintains its own sequence,
    so multiple generators can exist simultaneously without conflict.
  warnings: Do not use this constructor directly unless you understand the implications
    of GUID generation in TrinityCore. Incorrect usage may lead to duplicate GUIDs
    or conflicts in the database. The start value must be unique within the context
    of its HighGuid type to prevent collisions with existing objects.
