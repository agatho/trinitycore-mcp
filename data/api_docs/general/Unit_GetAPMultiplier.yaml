  signature: float Unit::GetAPMultiplier(int attType, bool normalized) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the attack power multiplier for specified attack type.
  description: The GetAPMultiplier method retrieves the attack power multiplier value
    for a given attack type, which is used in calculations involving weapon damage
    and attack power. This method is commonly used in combat calculations to determine
    how much attack power contributes to damage output. The normalized parameter controls
    whether the multiplier should be calculated with or without normalization factors,
    affecting the final result. The method is typically used in conjunction with other
    attack power related functions to calculate total damage values.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the attack power multiplier for the
    specified attack type. This value can be used to calculate weapon damage based
    on attack power. Values may vary depending on attack type and normalization settings,
    typically ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'float multiplier = unit->GetAPMultiplier(ATTACK_TYPE, false);

      float damage = multiplier * unit->GetAttackPower();'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely involves calculations based on
    attack type and normalization factors. Performance considerations: The method
    may involve multiple calculations depending on how it''s used in combat system.
    Thread safety: This method is thread-safe as it only reads data without modifying
    it.'
  warnings: 'This method should not be used directly for damage calculation without
    proper context, as the multiplier value may vary based on attack type and normalization
    settings. Common mistake: Using incorrect attack type values can lead to inaccurate
    damage calculations. Dangerous edge case: When attack power is zero, the multiplier
    might return 0.0 or negative values depending on implementation.'
