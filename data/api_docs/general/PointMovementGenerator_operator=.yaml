  brief: Moves a PointMovementGenerator object to another by transferring ownership
    of its resources
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment of a PointMovementGenerator
    object, transferring ownership of all resources from the source object to the
    target object. This is a standard C++ move semantics implementation that efficiently
    transfers internal data members without deep copying. The method is typically
    used when assigning one movement generator to another, particularly in scenarios
    involving temporary objects or container operations where efficiency is critical.
    After the move, the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target PointMovementGenerator object after the move
    assignment has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'PointMovementGenerator generator1;

      PointMovementGenerator generator2 = std::move(generator1); // Uses move assignment
      operator

      // generator1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container
    code: 'std::vector<PointMovementGenerator> generators;

      generators.emplace_back();

      generators.push_back(std::move(generators.front())); // Move assignment in vector

      // First element is moved to end, original is left in valid state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which is more efficient than copy semantics
    for objects containing dynamically allocated resources. The PointMovementGenerator
    class likely manages internal data structures that benefit from move semantics
    rather than deep copying. After a successful move, the source object should not
    be used in any operations that require its previous state.
  warnings: After calling this move assignment operator, the source object is left
    in a valid but unspecified state. Any further operations on the source object
    may result in undefined behavior unless explicitly documented otherwise. Ensure
    that no other code depends on the pre-move state of the source object.
