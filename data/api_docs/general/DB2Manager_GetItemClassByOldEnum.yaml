  signature: const ItemClassEntry * DB2Manager::GetItemClassByOldEnum(uint32 itemClass)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the ItemClassEntry corresponding to the specified old item class
    enum value.
  description: This method looks up and returns a pointer to the ItemClassEntry structure
    that matches the provided old item class enumeration value. It is used internally
    by TrinityCore to map legacy item class identifiers to their corresponding database
    entries. The method performs a lookup in an internal cache or data structure that
    maps old enum values to ItemClassEntry objects. This allows for backward compatibility
    with older code or data that still uses deprecated item class identifiers. The
    returned pointer is valid only as long as the DB2Manager instance remains alive
    and the underlying data has not been modified.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ItemClassEntry structure matching the specified old item
    class enum value, or nullptr if no match is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const ItemClassEntry* entry = sDB2Manager->GetItemClassByOldEnum(0);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    printf(\"Found item class: %s\\n\", entry->Name);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for compatibility with legacy data or code
    that still relies on old item class enum values. The internal lookup mechanism
    may involve caching for performance reasons. Ensure the DB2Manager instance is
    properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: The returned pointer becomes invalid if the DB2Manager instance is destroyed
    or if the underlying data is modified. Do not store pointers returned by this
    method across different game states or ticks unless you're certain about their
    validity.
