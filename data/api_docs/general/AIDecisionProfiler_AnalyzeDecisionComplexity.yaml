  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: AnalyzeDecisionComplexity
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::AnalyzeDecisionComplexity(uint32_t botGuid,
    BotAIDecisionProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and profiles the complexity of AI decisions made by a bot identified
    by its GUID.
  description: The AnalyzeDecisionComplexity method evaluates the decision-making
    process of a specific bot within the TrinityCore framework. It takes the bot's
    unique identifier (GUID) and a reference to a BotAIDecisionProfile object, which
    it populates with detailed metrics about the complexity of decisions made by that
    bot. This profiling includes factors such as decision depth, branching paths,
    and computational overhead involved in AI decision-making. The method is typically
    used for performance optimization, debugging, and understanding AI behavior patterns
    within the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose decision complexity
      is to be analyzed. This value must correspond to a valid bot instance in the
      current game session.
  - name: profile
    description: A reference to a BotAIDecisionProfile object that will be populated
      with complexity metrics and analysis results for the specified bot's AI decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotAIDecisionProfile profile;

      aiDecisionProfiler.AnalyzeDecisionComplexity(botGuid, profile);

      // profile now contains complexity analysis for bot with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Performance Logging
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      BotAIDecisionProfile profile;

      aiDecisionProfiler.AnalyzeDecisionComplexity(botGuid, profile);

      TC_LOG_INFO("ai", "Bot %u decision complexity: %f", botGuid, profile.GetAverageComplexity());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called during active gameplay sessions where
    bots are making decisions. The profiling data collected can be used for real-time
    AI optimization or post-processing analysis. Ensure that the bot GUID provided
    corresponds to an existing and active bot instance to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent or inactive bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or access violations. Always verify the existence of the
    bot before calling this method.
