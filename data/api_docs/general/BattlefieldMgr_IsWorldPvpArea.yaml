  class: BattlefieldMgr
  method: IsWorldPvpArea
  signature: bool BattlefieldMgr::IsWorldPvpArea(int zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified zone ID corresponds to a world PvP area
    in the game.
  description: The IsWorldPvpArea method checks if a given zone ID represents a zone
    that is configured for world PvP gameplay. This functionality is essential for
    TrinityCore's battlefield management system, as it allows the server to distinguish
    between regular zones and those where player-versus-player combat occurs in an
    open-world environment. The method typically consults internal data structures
    or configuration files that define which zones are designated as world PvP areas.
    It returns true if the zone is a world PvP area, false otherwise. This check is
    commonly used during zone transitions, player actions, and PvP-related event handling
    to ensure proper gameplay mechanics are applied.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone to check. This corresponds to the
      ZoneID field in the game's zone database, typically matching values found in
      the AreaTable.dbc file or related zone definitions.
  returns: Returns true if the specified zone ID is configured as a world PvP area;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates that the zone supports
    open-world player-versus-player combat mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a zone is a world PvP area
    code: "if (sBattlefieldMgr->IsWorldPvpArea(1234)) {\n    // Zone 1234 is a world\
      \ PvP area\n    // Apply PvP-specific logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the method to conditionally enable PvP mechanics
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterZone(Player* player, uint32 zoneId) {\n    if (sBattlefieldMgr->IsWorldPvpArea(zoneId))\
      \ {\n        player->SetPvP(true);\n        // Enable world PvP combat in this\
      \ zone\n    } else {\n        player->SetPvP(false);\n        // Disable world\
      \ PvP combat\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal zone configuration data that must be properly
    loaded and maintained. The zone ID parameter should correspond to valid zone identifiers
    present in the game's database. Performance is generally fast as it typically
    involves a lookup in an internal map or set structure, but frequent calls may
    impact performance if not cached appropriately.
  warnings: Ensure that the zoneId passed to this method corresponds to a valid zone
    defined in the game's data files. Passing invalid or out-of-range zone IDs could
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. This method should not be used
    as a substitute for proper zone validation in other systems.
