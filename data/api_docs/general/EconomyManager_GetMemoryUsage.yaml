  class: EconomyManager
  method: GetMemoryUsage
  signature: size_t EconomyManager::GetMemoryUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total memory usage of the EconomyManager instance
    in bytes.
  description: The GetMemoryUsage method provides a snapshot of the current memory
    consumption by the EconomyManager object. This includes all dynamically allocated
    data structures, caches, and internal storage used to manage in-game economy systems
    such as item prices, currency exchanges, and transaction records. The returned
    value represents an approximate total size in bytes and can be useful for performance
    monitoring, debugging memory leaks, or optimizing resource allocation within the
    TrinityCore server environment. This method performs a recursive calculation across
    all managed components without modifying any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the total memory usage of the EconomyManager
    instance in bytes. Returns 0 if no memory has been allocated or if the manager
    is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Usage Check
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = sEconomyMgr;

      size_t memoryUsed = economyMgr->GetMemoryUsage();

      TC_LOG_INFO("economy", "Current EconomyManager memory usage: %zu bytes", memoryUsed);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Memory Growth Over Time
    code: "EconomyManager* economyMgr = sEconomyMgr;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i)\n\
      {\n    // Simulate economy operations\n    economyMgr->ProcessTransaction(...);\n\
      \    if (i % 100 == 0)\n    {\n        size_t currentUsage = economyMgr->GetMemoryUsage();\n\
      \        TC_LOG_INFO(\"economy\", \"Memory usage after %d transactions: %zu\
      \ bytes\", i, currentUsage);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve traversing internal data structures and could have
    performance implications if called frequently. It is recommended to cache the
    result or call it sparingly during critical server operations. The memory calculation
    includes overhead from STL containers and may not reflect actual physical memory
    usage due to memory allocator behavior.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for precise real-time memory profiling as it
    provides an approximation. The value returned might vary between different compiler
    optimizations or system configurations. Avoid calling this method in high-frequency
    loops or during critical sections of code where performance is paramount.
