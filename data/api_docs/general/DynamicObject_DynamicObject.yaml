  class: DynamicObject
  method: DynamicObject
  signature: void DynamicObject::DynamicObject(bool isWorldObject)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DynamicObject instance with specified world object status.
  description: The DynamicObject constructor initializes a new dynamic object instance
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the internal state of the
    dynamic object, determining whether it should be treated as a world object in
    the game environment. The isWorldObject parameter controls how the object interacts
    with the server's world system, affecting visibility, update behavior, and integration
    with other game mechanics such as collision detection and player interaction.
    This constructor is typically invoked internally by the core systems when creating
    dynamic effects like area auras, spell effects, or environmental objects that
    persist in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: isWorldObject
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this dynamic object should be treated
      as a world object. When true, the object participates in world updates and visibility
      calculations; when false, it may behave as a temporary or non-world object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a DynamicObject as a World Object
    code: 'DynamicObject* obj = new DynamicObject(true);

      // This creates a dynamic object that will be updated and visible in the world'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a DynamicObject as Non-World Object
    code: 'DynamicObject* obj = new DynamicObject(false);

      // This creates a temporary dynamic object that doesn''t participate in world
      updates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the base class initialization for all dynamic
    objects. It's important to note that dynamic objects created with isWorldObject=true
    will be managed by the ObjectMgr and subject to regular update cycles, while those
    with false may require manual cleanup or special handling. The constructor does
    not perform any network serialization or packet sending; it only initializes internal
    state.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the isWorldObject flag can lead to unexpected behavior
    including missing updates, incorrect visibility, or memory leaks if the object
    isn't properly removed from world systems. Developers should ensure proper cleanup
    of dynamic objects when they are no longer needed, especially those marked as
    world objects.
