  class: GroupCoordination
  method: MoveToPosition
  signature: void GroupCoordination::MoveToPosition(const int & destination, bool
    maintainFormation)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a group movement to a specified destination coordinate while optionally
    maintaining formation.
  description: 'The MoveToPosition method instructs a group of players or NPCs to
    move toward a defined destination coordinate. It supports optional formation maintenance,
    ensuring that group members preserve their relative positions during the movement.
    This functionality is commonly used in quest scripting, instance management, and
    AI-driven group behaviors within TrinityCore''s framework. The method does not
    block execution; instead, it schedules the movement asynchronously. Precondition:
    The destination must be a valid coordinate within the game world. Postcondition:
    Group members begin moving toward the destination with potentially adjusted paths
    to maintain formation if enabled.'
  parameters:
  - name: destination
    description: An integer identifier representing the target location or waypoint
      for the group to move towards. This value typically corresponds to a predefined
      coordinate in the game world, such as a quest objective or NPC spawn point.
  - name: maintainFormation
    description: A boolean flag that determines whether the group should attempt to
      preserve its formation during movement. If true, group members will adjust their
      paths to maintain relative positions; if false, they may take individual routes
      to the destination.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Movement
    code: 'GroupCoordination* group = ...;

      group->MoveToPosition(12345, true); // Move to waypoint 12345 while maintaining
      formation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Formation-Free Movement
    code: 'GroupCoordination* group = ...;

      group->MoveToPosition(67890, false); // Move to waypoint 67890 without maintaining
      formation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's Group Coordination system and integrates
    with the core movement engine. It relies on pathfinding algorithms to determine
    optimal routes for each group member. Performance may be impacted by large groups
    or complex terrain. The method assumes that the destination coordinate is valid
    and accessible within the current map context.
  warnings: Using invalid destination IDs can lead to undefined behavior or failed
    movement attempts. Ensure that all coordinates passed are verified against the
    game's internal waypoint database before calling this method. Failure to maintain
    formation in tight spaces may cause group members to get stuck or separated.
