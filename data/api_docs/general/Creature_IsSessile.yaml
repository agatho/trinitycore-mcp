  method: IsSessile
  signature: bool Creature::IsSessile() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is in a sessile state, meaning it is not
    moving.
  description: The IsSessile method checks if a creature is currently in a sessile
    state, which means it has stopped moving and is remaining stationary. This is
    typically used to determine if a creature is standing still or has been immobilized
    by certain game mechanics such as being under the effect of a spell that prevents
    movement. The method returns true when the creature is sessile and false otherwise,
    indicating that the creature is actively moving or has not yet entered a sessile
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is in a sessile state (not moving), false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the creature has stopped moving or is currently
    active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsSessile()) {\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI scripts to determine if a creature should
    remain stationary or not. It's important to note that the sessile state may be
    affected by various game mechanics such as movement spells, and the method might
    return false even if the creature appears to be standing still due to other factors.
  warnings: This method does not guarantee that the creature is actually immobile;
    it only checks whether the creature is currently in a sessile state. It's possible
    for a creature to appear stationary but still be actively moving, especially if
    movement is controlled by external factors like spell effects or AI behavior.
