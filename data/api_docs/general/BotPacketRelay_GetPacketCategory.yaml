  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: GetPacketCategory
  signature: const char * BotPacketRelay::GetPacketCategory(uint32 opcode)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the category name associated with a given packet opcode for bot
    communication handling.
  description: The GetPacketCategory method maps a provided World of Warcraft packet
    opcode to its corresponding category string, which is used internally by the BotPacketRelay
    system to organize and route packets appropriately. This functionality allows
    the system to determine how specific types of packets should be handled or processed
    within the bot framework. The method does not modify any internal state and serves
    purely as a lookup mechanism. It assumes that valid opcodes are passed, as invalid
    opcodes may result in undefined behavior or return unexpected category strings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A null-terminated character string representing the category name associated
    with the given opcode. Returns NULL if the opcode is not recognized or if no category
    mapping exists for it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 opcode = 0x1234;\nconst char* category = botPacketRelay->GetPacketCategory(opcode);\n\
      if (category)\n{\n    printf(\"Packet category: %s\\n\", category);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with packet filtering and routing
    logic within the TrinityCore bot system. It's important to note that the returned
    string pointer points to internal static memory, so it should not be modified
    or freed by the caller.
  warnings: Do not assume that all opcodes will have a defined category; always check
    for NULL return values before using the result. Passing invalid opcode values
    may lead to undefined behavior depending on how the mapping table is implemented
    internally.
