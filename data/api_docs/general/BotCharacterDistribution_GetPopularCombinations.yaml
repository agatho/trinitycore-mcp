  signature: std::vector<RaceClassCombination> BotCharacterDistribution::GetPopularCombinations()
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of the most frequently selected race-class combinations
    for bot characters.
  description: The GetPopularCombinations method returns a vector containing the most
    commonly chosen race-class pairings among bot characters in the game. This data
    is typically used to inform character distribution strategies, balance considerations,
    or to populate default selections when generating new bots. The combinations are
    ordered by popularity, with the most frequently selected appearing first in the
    returned vector. This method does not modify any internal state and can be called
    multiple times without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<RaceClassCombination> containing the race-class combinations
    sorted by their frequency of selection among bot characters. Each element represents
    a unique pairing of race and class, with the order indicating popularity rank.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through popular combinations
    code: "BotCharacterDistribution distribution;\nstd::vector<RaceClassCombination>\
      \ combinations = distribution.GetPopularCombinations();\nfor (const auto& combo\
      \ : combinations) {\n    std::cout << \"Race: \" << combo.race << \", Class:\
      \ \" << combo.class_ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of character selections and may not
    reflect real-time data if the bot distribution system is updated dynamically.
    The returned vector should be treated as read-only, and modifications to its contents
    will not affect the underlying distribution logic.
