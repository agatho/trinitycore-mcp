  method: SetCurrentEquipmentId
  signature: void Creature::SetCurrentEquipmentId(uint8 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the current equipment ID for the creature, determining which equipment
    set is active.
  description: This method sets the current equipment ID for a Creature object, allowing
    developers to control which equipment set is active for the creature. The equipment
    ID corresponds to different equipment configurations defined in the creature's
    database entries. This method is typically used during creature AI or initialization
    to set specific equipment configurations, and can be called multiple times during
    a creature's lifetime to switch between different equipment sets. It affects the
    creature's visual appearance and behavior, particularly in terms of weapon and
    armor selection.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The equipment ID to set for the creature. Valid values are typically
      0-2, representing different equipment configurations. Value 0 usually means
      no equipment, while values 1 and 2 represent different equipment sets defined
      in the creature's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Equipment ID to 1
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->SetCurrentEquipmentId(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Equipment ID based on AI decision
    code: "if (creature->GetEntry() == 12345)\n{\n    creature->SetCurrentEquipmentId(2);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    creature->SetCurrentEquipmentId(1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly affect the creature's equipment items, but
    rather sets which equipment configuration is active. The actual equipment items
    are determined by the creature's database entries and may be modified through
    other methods like SetEquipmentTemplate or SetEquipmentFromTemplate.
  warnings: Care must be taken when calling this method as it can affect the creature's
    visual appearance and behavior. Setting incorrect equipment IDs can lead to visual
    inconsistencies or inappropriate weapon selection for the creature. This method
    should not be called during combat or while the creature is in a state that could
    cause conflicts with existing equipment.
