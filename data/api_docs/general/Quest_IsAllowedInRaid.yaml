documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is allowed in raid content based on difficulty
    settings.
  description: This method checks if a quest can be completed within raid instances,
    taking into account the difficulty level of the quest and the current raid settings.
    It evaluates whether the quest's requirements are compatible with the raid's difficulty
    constraints, ensuring that players can access and complete quests in appropriate
    raid content. The method is commonly used to validate quest eligibility for raid
    dungeons or raids, particularly when determining if a quest should be available
    for higher difficulty modes such as Heroic or Mythic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is allowed in raid content for the specified
    difficulty, false otherwise. This indicates whether the quest can be accepted
    and completed within raid instances, considering the current difficulty level
    of the raid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsAllowedInRaid(Difficulty::NORMAL_RAID)) {\n    // Quest is\
      \ allowed in normal raid\n}\nelse {\n    // Quest is not allowed in normal raid\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks against the quest's difficulty requirements
    and compares them with the current raid's difficulty settings. It does not consider
    player level or other factors, only the difficulty constraints of the quest itself.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when validating quest eligibility
    for raid content, as incorrect usage may lead to quests being unavailable in appropriate
    raid modes. Ensure that the difficulty parameter matches the intended raid mode.
