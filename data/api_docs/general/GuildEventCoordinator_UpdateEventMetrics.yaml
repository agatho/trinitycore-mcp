  method: UpdateEventMetrics
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::UpdateEventMetrics(uint32 eventId, bool wasSuccessful)
documentation:
  brief: Updates metrics for a specified guild event based on its success status.
  description: The UpdateEventMetrics method is responsible for recording and updating
    statistical data related to a specific guild event. It takes an event identifier
    and a boolean flag indicating whether the event was successful, then processes
    this information to maintain accurate event performance metrics within the GuildEventCoordinator
    system. This method likely contributes to tracking guild activity, event completion
    rates, and overall guild engagement statistics. The method operates within the
    context of TrinityCore's guild management subsystem and is typically invoked when
    an event concludes, either successfully or unsuccessfully.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier for the guild event being updated. This value should
      correspond to a valid event registered with the GuildEventCoordinator system.
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the event completed successfully
      (true) or failed/terminated early (false). Used to determine which metrics to
      increment or update.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateEventMetrics(12345, true); // Mark event 12345 as successful'
    language: cpp
  - title: Failure Case Example
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateEventMetrics(67890, false); // Mark event 67890 as failed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters or statistical databases within
    the GuildEventCoordinator. It may be called automatically by event completion
    handlers or manually during custom event management logic. The implementation
    should handle concurrent access if multiple threads are managing guild events
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that eventId corresponds to a valid, registered event before calling
    this method to avoid potential errors or undefined behavior. Improper use of the
    wasSuccessful parameter may lead to incorrect statistical data being recorded.
