documentation:
  brief: Returns the creation mode of the player character.
  description: The GetCreateMode method retrieves the PlayerCreateMode enumeration
    value that indicates how the player character was created. This mode can be used
    to determine whether the character is a new character, a resurrected character,
    or one that was created through other special means. The returned value helps
    the game logic distinguish between different states of character creation and
    initialization during the player's session.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PlayerCreateMode enumeration value indicating the character's creation
    state. Possible values include PC_MODE_NEW_CHARACTER, PC_MODE_RESURRECTED, and
    others depending on the character's initialization path.
  examples:
  - title: Check if player is a new character
    code: "if (player->GetCreateMode() == PC_MODE_NEW_CHARACTER)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ new character specific logic\n    player->SendNotification(\"Welcome to the\
      \ realm!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player login and initialization phases.
    The PlayerCreateMode enum values are defined in the TrinityCore codebase and may
    vary depending on the specific implementation and game version.
