  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: IsProfessionMaterial
  signature: bool ProfessionAuctionBridge::IsProfessionMaterial(uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given item ID represents a profession material used
    in crafting or auctioning.
  description: The IsProfessionMaterial method checks if a specified item ID corresponds
    to an item that is classified as a profession material within the TrinityCore
    auction system. This functionality is essential for identifying items that can
    be used in crafting professions or traded through the auction house interface.
    The method typically evaluates internal data structures or lookup tables that
    define which items are considered valid profession materials, ensuring proper
    filtering and categorization of items during auction processing. It's commonly
    used to validate item eligibility before allowing auction creation or to filter
    displayed items in profession-related UI elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified item ID is recognized as a profession material;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (bridge.IsProfessionMaterial(12345)) {\n    // Item 12345 is a profession\
      \ material\n    printf(\"Item is valid for crafting\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering Auction Items
    code: "std::vector<uint32> auctionItems = GetAuctionItems();\nfor (uint32 itemId\
      \ : auctionItems) {\n    if (bridge.IsProfessionMaterial(itemId)) {\n      \
      \  // Process profession material items\n        AddToCraftingList(itemId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on cached data structures or database lookups to
    determine profession material status. Performance may be optimized through internal
    caching mechanisms, but repeated calls with varying item IDs could impact performance
    if not properly managed.
