  class: PlayerTaxi
  method: InitTaxiNodesForLevel
  signature: void PlayerTaxi::InitTaxiNodesForLevel(uint32 race, uint32 chrClass,
    uint8 level)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes taxi node access for a player based on their race, class, and
    level.
  description: The InitTaxiNodesForLevel method sets up the initial set of available
    taxi nodes for a player character. This method is typically called during player
    creation or level-up to determine which flight paths the player can access based
    on their racial and class restrictions, as well as their current level. The method
    ensures that players can only access taxi nodes appropriate to their character's
    progression and faction. It modifies the internal state of the PlayerTaxi object
    to reflect these available nodes.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The race ID of the player character (e.g., 1 for Human, 2 for Orc).
      Determines racial restrictions on taxi node access.
  - name: chrClass
    description: The class ID of the player character (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for
      Paladin). Influences available flight paths based on class-specific restrictions.
  - name: level
    description: The current level of the player character. Affects which taxi nodes
      become available as the character progresses through the game.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize taxi nodes for a new player
    code: 'PlayerTaxi taxi;

      taxi.InitTaxiNodesForLevel(1, 1, 1); // Human Warrior at level 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update taxi nodes when player levels up
    code: 'PlayerTaxi* taxi = player->GetPlayerTaxi();

      taxi->InitTaxiNodesForLevel(player->getRace(), player->getClass(), player->getLevel());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core game systems during
    character creation and level progression. It modifies internal taxi node state
    and does not return any value. The implementation likely checks against predefined
    taxi node data tables that define which nodes are accessible to different races,
    classes, and levels.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player's race, class, and level
    are properly initialized. Calling it with invalid parameters may result in incorrect
    taxi node access or game state corruption.
