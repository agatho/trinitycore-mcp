  class: AreaTriggerOrbit
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void AreaTriggerOrbit::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const AreaTrigger
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes creation data for an area trigger orbit to a packet buffer for transmission
    to a player.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of an AreaTriggerOrbit
    object into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for network transmission to a specific
    player. This method is typically invoked during the initial synchronization of
    area trigger data when a player enters the world or encounters a new area trigger.
    It ensures that the client receives all necessary information to render and manage
    the orbiting area trigger effect. The serialization includes relevant metadata
    such as the owner's identifier, position, orientation, and other visual or functional
    properties required by the client for proper rendering and behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: The ByteBuffer into which the creation data will be written. This
      buffer is typically used to construct a network packet containing the serialized
      area trigger information.
  - name: owner
    description: A pointer to the AreaTrigger object that owns this orbit. This parameter
      defines the base trigger around which the orbiting effect is calculated and
      provides essential properties like position, scale, and duration.
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object who will receive this area trigger
      data. The method may use this to determine visibility rules or apply player-specific
      modifications to the serialized data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Area Trigger Initialization
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      AreaTriggerOrbit orbit;

      Player* player = ...; // some player instance

      AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // some area trigger instance

      orbit.WriteCreate(data, trigger, player);

      // Send ''data'' to the player''s client as part of a packet'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's network serialization system for
    area triggers. It assumes that the provided parameters are valid and not null.
    The method does not perform any validation on input pointers, so callers must
    ensure correctness. The data written to the buffer may be subject to client-side
    filtering or visibility rules based on player state.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or null pointers as it will likely
    result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the AreaTrigger object passed in has
    been properly initialized before calling this method, especially if relying on
    its properties for serialization.
