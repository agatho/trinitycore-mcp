documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the danger level at a specified position within the
    danger zone.
  description: The GetDangerAtPosition method evaluates the danger level at a given
    position within a defined danger zone. It takes into account various factors such
    as proximity to threats, environmental hazards, and time-based decay of danger.
    This method is commonly used in AI behavior scripting to determine safe paths
    or threat avoidance strategies for NPCs. The result is a floating-point value
    representing the danger intensity at that specific location, where higher values
    indicate greater risk. The method uses the current game time to adjust danger
    levels dynamically based on temporal factors like cooldowns or temporary hazards.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position identifier or coordinate within the danger zone. This
      parameter likely represents a specific location in the world space or an index
      into a precomputed danger map.
  - name: currentTime
    description: The current game time in milliseconds. Used to calculate time-dependent
      danger modifications such as fading hazards, temporary threat levels, or dynamic
      environmental changes.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated danger level at the specified
    position. Values typically range from 0.0 (no danger) to higher values indicating
    increasing danger intensity. Negative values may indicate safe zones or special
    conditions depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check danger at a specific location
    code: "float dangerLevel = dangerZone->GetDangerAtPosition(12345, WorldTimer::getMSTime());\n\
      if (dangerLevel > 5.0f)\n{\n    // Avoid this position\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\"\
      , \"High danger detected at position 12345: {}\", dangerLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using danger level for pathfinding decisions
    code: "uint32 currentPosition = player->GetPositionX() * 1000 + player->GetPositionY();\n\
      float currentDanger = dangerZone->GetDangerAtPosition(currentPosition, WorldTimer::getMSTime());\n\
      if (currentDanger > 10.0f)\n{\n    // Find alternative path\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      ai\", \"Avoiding high danger zone with level {}\", currentDanger);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations involving distance metrics,
    threat proximity, and time-based modifiers. The implementation may cache previous
    results for performance optimization. Developers should be aware that the returned
    value is dynamic and changes based on currentTime parameter.
  warnings: Ensure that the position identifier passed to this method corresponds
    to a valid location within the danger zone's defined boundaries. Passing invalid
    or out-of-bounds positions may result in undefined behavior or incorrect danger
    calculations.
