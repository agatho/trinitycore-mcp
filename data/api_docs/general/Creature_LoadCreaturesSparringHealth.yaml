  signature: void Creature::LoadCreaturesSparringHealth(bool force)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes sparring health values for creatures.
  description: The LoadCreaturesSparringHealth method is responsible for loading and
    initializing the health statistics specifically used in sparring scenarios within
    the game. This method ensures that creature entries have their appropriate sparring
    health values set, which may differ from their standard health values. It typically
    runs during creature initialization or when entering a sparring context. The method
    accepts a force parameter that determines whether to reload existing data or only
    initialize new entries.
  parameters:
  - name: force
    description: When true, forces the reloading of all creature sparring health data
      regardless of current state. When false, only initializes data for creatures
      that do not already have sparring health values set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->LoadCreaturesSparringHealth(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Force Reload
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->LoadCreaturesSparringHealth(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during the initialization phase of a creature's
    lifecycle or when transitioning into a sparring arena. It may interact with database
    entries or cached values to ensure proper health configuration for combat scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method with force=true repeatedly might cause performance
    overhead if done excessively, especially on large numbers of creatures. Ensure
    that it is only invoked when necessary to avoid unnecessary data reloading.
