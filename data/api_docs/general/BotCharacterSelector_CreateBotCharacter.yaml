  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: CreateBotCharacter
  signature: int BotCharacterSelector::CreateBotCharacter(uint32 accountId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot character for the specified account ID and returns its
    unique identifier.
  description: The CreateBotCharacter method is responsible for generating a new bot
    character within the TrinityCore framework. It takes an account ID as input, validates
    it, and proceeds to create a new character associated with that account. The method
    handles the necessary database operations and internal state management required
    to integrate the new bot character into the game world. This functionality is
    typically used in automated testing environments or AI-driven gameplay systems
    where multiple bot characters need to be dynamically created. The method ensures
    proper initialization of the character's properties, including name generation,
    race, class, and starting stats. It also performs checks to prevent duplicate
    characters or invalid account references.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account for which the bot character
      will be created. Must be a valid, existing account ID in the database.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the newly
    created bot character. Returns 0 if the creation fails due to invalid account
    ID or other errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Character Creation
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nint newBotGuid = botSelector->CreateBotCharacter(accountId);\n\
      if (newBotGuid > 0) {\n    printf(\"Successfully created bot character with\
      \ GUID: %d\\n\", newBotGuid);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to create bot character\
      \ for account %d\\n\", accountId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Bot Characters
    code: "uint32 accountIds[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)\
      \ {\n    int guid = botSelector->CreateBotCharacter(accountIds[i]);\n    if\
      \ (guid > 0) {\n        printf(\"Created bot character %d for account %d\\n\"\
      , guid, accountIds[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotCharacterSelector instance has been properly
    initialized with access to the game database. The created bot character will be
    immediately available in the game world but may require additional setup for full
    functionality. Character creation follows standard TrinityCore naming conventions
    and validation rules.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid account ID can result in undefined
    behavior or database corruption. Ensure that the accountId parameter references
    an existing account before calling this method. The method does not perform any
    authentication checks beyond verifying the account exists.
