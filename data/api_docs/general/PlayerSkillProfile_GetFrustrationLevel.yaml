  signature: float PlayerSkillProfile::GetFrustrationLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current frustration level of the player's skill
    progression.
  description: The GetFrustrationLevel method computes a float value representing
    how frustrated a player feels based on their skill advancement progress within
    the game. This metric typically reflects the balance between effort invested and
    skill gains, often used to influence gameplay mechanics such as skill point distribution,
    learning curve adjustments, or player engagement metrics. The method does not
    modify any internal state and is purely informational. It may consider factors
    like time spent training, skill level differences, and progression rate against
    expected benchmarks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the frustration level, where
    0.0 indicates no frustration (smooth progression) and 1.0 indicates maximum frustration
    (stagnant or regressive skill development). Values in between indicate varying
    degrees of player dissatisfaction with their current skill advancement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float frustration = player->GetFrustrationLevel();\nif (frustration > 0.7f)\n\
      {\n    // Notify player about high frustration\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Your skill progression feels slow.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Training Difficulty
    code: "float frustration = player->GetFrustrationLevel();\nif (frustration > 0.8f)\n\
      {\n    // Reduce difficulty for overly frustrated players\n    player->SetSkillRate(0.5f);\n\
      }\nelse if (frustration < 0.3f)\n{\n    // Increase challenge for satisfied\
      \ players\n    player->SetSkillRate(1.5f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations based on internal skill tracking
    data and may be influenced by recent training sessions, skill level thresholds,
    and time-based decay factors. It is recommended to cache the result if called
    frequently in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: The returned value might not accurately reflect player perception if external
    factors like quest rewards or item bonuses significantly alter skill gain rates.
    Additionally, this method should not be used for making critical gameplay decisions
    without considering other related metrics.
