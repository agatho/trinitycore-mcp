documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GameEventMgr instance and cleans up all associated game event
    data and resources.
  description: The ~GameEventMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all memory and resources allocated by the GameEventMgr singleton. This includes
    stopping any active game events, removing event-related callbacks, and freeing
    internal data structures that manage event states. The destructor ensures that
    no memory leaks occur when the game server shuts down or when the event manager
    is explicitly destroyed. It should only be called by the system itself during
    application shutdown or through proper object lifecycle management.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction during server shutdown
    code: '// The destructor is automatically called when the server shuts down

      // No explicit call needed - handled by the TrinityCore framework

      // Example of how it would be used internally:

      GameEventMgr* eventMgr = GameEventMgr::instance();

      // ... other operations ...

      // When eventMgr goes out of scope or server shuts down, ~GameEventMgr is called
      automatically'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is part of the singleton pattern implementation for GameEventMgr.
    It's important to note that this method should never be called directly by user
    code as it's meant to be invoked only during object destruction. The cleanup process
    may involve stopping active events and releasing resources that could otherwise
    cause memory leaks if not properly handled.
