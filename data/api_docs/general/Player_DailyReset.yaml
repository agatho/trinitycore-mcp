  brief: Resets the player's daily quest progress and related game mechanics
  description: The DailyReset method resets all daily quest progress for the player,
    including quest completion status, daily quest counters, and related game mechanics.
    This method is typically called at the start of each new day to ensure players
    can complete daily quests again. It handles the reset of daily quest objectives,
    achievement counters, and other daily-related game systems that are tied to the
    player's progress. The method ensures that players can start fresh with their
    daily quest progression when they log in or when a new day begins.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->DailyReset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the game system when a new
    day begins, but can also be manually invoked by developers for testing purposes.
    The implementation involves resetting various daily quest related variables and
    counters within the player's data structures.
  warnings: This method should not be called during active gameplay sessions as it
    may cause issues with quest progression or achievement tracking. It's best used
    only when the player is not actively engaged in gameplay activities.
