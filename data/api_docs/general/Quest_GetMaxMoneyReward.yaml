documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum money reward for a quest.
  description: The GetMaxMoneyReward method retrieves the maximum amount of money
    that can be rewarded to players upon completing a specific quest. This value represents
    the upper limit of gold rewards that can be earned from a single quest, which
    is determined by the quest's design and difficulty level. The method is commonly
    used in quest reward calculations and helps determine the maximum gold a player
    can receive when completing a quest.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the maximum money reward value as an unsigned integer (uint32),
    representing the total gold amount that can be earned from completing the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 maxMoney = quest->GetMaxMoneyReward();\n// Use maxMoney in reward\
      \ calculations\nif (maxMoney > 0)\n{\n    // Process reward logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest completion processing and may
    be called multiple times during a quest's lifecycle. The value returned represents
    the maximum gold that can be earned from the quest, not necessarily the actual
    reward amount.
  warnings: The method should be used carefully as it may return zero if no money
    reward is specified for the quest, which could lead to incorrect reward calculations
    in some cases.
