  signature: void GameEventMgr::UpdateEventNPCFlags(uint16 event_id)
documentation:
  brief: Updates NPC flags for all game events in the specified event ID.
  description: The UpdateEventNPCFlags method is responsible for updating the NPC
    flags associated with a specific game event. This typically involves modifying
    the visibility, interactability, or other behavioral attributes of NPCs that are
    part of the event. The method ensures that NPCs correctly reflect their event-specific
    states, such as becoming visible or hidden based on the event's active status.
    It is commonly called during event start and end transitions to synchronize NPC
    states with the current event conditions. This method does not directly modify
    the event itself but rather adjusts how NPCs behave within the context of the
    event.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event for which NPC flags need
      to be updated. This value corresponds to the ID used in the game events database
      table.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update NPC Flags for Event ID 42
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->UpdateEventNPCFlags(42);
    language: cpp
  - title: Update NPC Flags When Starting an Event
    code: "void OnEventStart(uint16 eventId)\n{\n    // Perform event start logic\n\
      \    GameEventMgr::instance()->UpdateEventNPCFlags(eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the game event system when
    an event begins or ends. Developers should be aware that this method may cause
    performance overhead if called frequently with many NPCs involved. It's recommended
    to batch updates where possible.
  warnings: Calling this method manually without proper context may lead to inconsistent
    NPC states. Ensure that the event_id corresponds to a valid active event before
    calling this function.
