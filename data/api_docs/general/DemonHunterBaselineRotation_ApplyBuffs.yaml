  class: DemonHunterBaselineRotation
  method: ApplyBuffs
  signature: void DemonHunterBaselineRotation::ApplyBuffs(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Applies all applicable buffs and enhancements to the Demon Hunter bot character.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for managing and applying various
    buff effects to a Demon Hunter AI-controlled character within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method typically evaluates the current state of the bot, including
    its health, mana, combat readiness, and available abilities, then determines which
    buffs should be active. It ensures that the Demon Hunter maintains optimal performance
    in combat by activating appropriate auras, enhancements, and temporary stat boosts.
    The method operates within the context of the DemonHunterBaselineRotation class,
    which defines the core behavior and decision-making logic for Demon Hunter AI.
    This function is crucial for maintaining consistent and effective bot performance
    during both PvE and PvP scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or index
      within the AI system. This parameter is used to locate and manipulate the specific
      Demon Hunter instance that will receive the buffs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int botId = 12345;

      rotation.ApplyBuffs(&botId);

      // Applies all necessary buffs to the Demon Hunter with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::Update()\n{\n    int botId = this->GetBotId();\n  \
      \  if (ShouldApplyBuffs())\n    {\n        rotation.ApplyBuffs(&botId);\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically during the AI's update cycle to
    ensure buffs remain active. The implementation may include checks for buff expiration
    times and reapplication logic. Developers should be aware that this method directly
    modifies the bot's state and may affect combat performance if not used carefully.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect buff application or
    conflicts with other AI systems. Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid
    Demon Hunter instance before calling this method, as dereferencing an invalid
    pointer will cause undefined behavior.
