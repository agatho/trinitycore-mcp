  class: PathfindingManager
  method: WillPathIntersectWithGroupMember
  signature: bool PathfindingManager::WillPathIntersectWithGroupMember(const int &
    waypoints, const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a path will intersect with a group member based on waypoint
    and group parameters.
  description: The WillPathIntersectWithGroupMember method evaluates if a path defined
    by waypoints will collide or intersect with any member of a specified group. This
    functionality is typically used in AI pathfinding logic to avoid paths that would
    lead to collisions with friendly units. The method takes into account the current
    positions and movement patterns of both the path and group members. It's particularly
    useful for group-based navigation where maintaining formation or avoiding friendly
    fire is important. The implementation likely uses spatial calculations and collision
    detection algorithms to determine intersection.
  parameters:
  - name: waypoints
    description: An integer representing the number of waypoints in the path to be
      evaluated. This parameter defines how many points make up the path being checked
      for intersections.
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier representing the group whose members are checked
      against the path. This typically refers to a group ID or index used internally
      by the TrinityCore group management system.
  returns: Returns true if the path intersects with any member of the specified group,
    false otherwise. The method returns false when no intersection is detected or
    if either parameter is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check path intersection
    code: "bool intersects = sPathfindingManager->WillPathIntersectWithGroupMember(5,\
      \ 123);\nif (intersects)\n{\n    // Handle path intersection with group member\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Path intersects with group member\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI decision making for group movement
    code: "if (!sPathfindingManager->WillPathIntersectWithGroupMember(pathWaypoints,\
      \ playerGroup))\n{\n    // Proceed with path execution\n    player->MoveTowards(targetPosition);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Find alternative path or wait\n    player->SetMovementFlags(MOVEFLAG_WALKING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger pathfinding system that handles group
    coordination. The implementation may involve caching of group member positions
    for performance reasons. It's recommended to validate the waypoint and group parameters
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: The method may not be thread-safe if used outside of the main game thread
    context. Ensure proper synchronization when accessing group data or path information
    from multiple threads. Invalid group IDs or waypoint counts could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
