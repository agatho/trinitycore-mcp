  class: UnholyDeathKnightRefactored
  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void UnholyDeathKnightRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the unholy death knight's single-target rotation logic for the specified
    target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core AI logic
    for an unholy death knight when engaging a single enemy target. This method determines
    which abilities and spells should be cast based on the current combat state, resource
    levels, and cooldowns. It evaluates the optimal sequence of actions such as Blood
    Plague application, Death Coil usage, and other unholy-specific abilities to maximize
    damage output or survival mechanics. The method typically integrates with the
    broader AI framework to ensure proper targeting, threat management, and spell
    prioritization within the context of a single-target encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      in the combat system. This value is used to retrieve the target object from
      the AI's internal target list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      unholyDK->ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "if (player->GetVictim()) {\n    int targetId = player->GetVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    unholyDK->ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target is valid and exists in the combat environment.
    It may modify internal state variables related to spell cooldowns, resource usage,
    and targeting logic. The implementation likely includes checks for line of sight,
    target validity, and spell range before executing any actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid target object; otherwise,
    undefined behavior may occur. This method should not be called outside of combat
    or when no valid target exists. Improper use might lead to incorrect AI behavior
    or crashes.
