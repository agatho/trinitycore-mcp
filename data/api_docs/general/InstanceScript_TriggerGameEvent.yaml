  class: InstanceScript
  method: TriggerGameEvent
  signature: void InstanceScript::TriggerGameEvent(uint32 gameEventId, int * source,
    int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers a game event with the specified ID, optionally using source and
    target parameters for event context.
  description: The TriggerGameEvent method activates a game event identified by its
    unique ID within the instance script context. This method allows for dynamic event
    activation during gameplay, which can be used to control quest events, seasonal
    activities, or other timed in-game occurrences. The optional source and target
    parameters provide additional context to the event trigger, potentially influencing
    how the event is processed or which objects are affected. Game events triggered
    through this method will follow the standard TrinityCore game event system behavior,
    including any associated conditions, rewards, or state changes defined for that
    specific event.
  parameters:
  - name: gameEventId
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to trigger. This ID must
      correspond to a valid game event defined in the database.
  - name: source
    description: Optional pointer to an integer representing the source of the event
      trigger. Can be NULL if no specific source is required.
  - name: target
    description: Optional pointer to an integer representing the target of the event
      trigger. Can be NULL if no specific target is required.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Game Event Trigger
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::HandleEventTrigger()\n{\n    TriggerGameEvent(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Game Event with Source and Target Context
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::ActivateHolidayEvent(Player* player)\n{\n    int\
      \ source = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n    int target = 0;\n    TriggerGameEvent(54321,\
      \ &source, &target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of an instance script and should
    only be called when the instance is properly initialized. The game event must
    exist in the database for the trigger to have any effect. Source and target parameters
    are passed directly to the underlying game event system and may be used by event
    handlers to determine behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid gameEventId will result in no action
    being taken but may cause errors in logs. Ensure that all referenced game events
    are properly defined in the database before triggering them.
