  signature: void WorldSession::SendOpenTransmogrifier(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a transmogrifier window open packet to the client for the specified
    GUID.
  description: The SendOpenTransmogrifier method is used to display the transmogrification
    interface to a player in World of Warcraft. This method sends a packet to the
    client that opens the transmogrifier window, allowing the player to view and modify
    the appearance of their items. The method takes a GUID parameter which identifies
    the specific object (typically an NPC) that the transmogrifier is associated with.
    When called, this method triggers the client-side UI update to show the transmogrification
    interface, enabling players to select items for transmogrification based on the
    available options provided by the associated NPC.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The GUID of the object (typically an NPC) that the transmogrifier
      is associated with. This identifies which transmogrifier interface to open for
      the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Opening Transmogrifier for an NPC
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      uint32 npcGuid = 12345;

      session->SendOpenTransmogrifier(npcGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player interacts with a transmogrifier
    NPC. The GUID parameter should reference a valid NPC object that has transmogrification
    capabilities enabled in the database. The actual transmogrification logic and
    item validation occurs server-side after the client sends back transmogrification
    requests.
