documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of one ScriptMgr instance to another, transferring all
    script-related data and state.
  description: The ScriptMgr move constructor transfers ownership of all internal
    script data and resources from the source ScriptMgr object to the current object.
    This operation is typically used during object initialization or when reassigning
    ScriptMgr instances. The moved-from object will be left in a valid but unspecified
    state, suitable for immediate destruction or assignment. This method supports
    efficient resource management by avoiding unnecessary copying of script configurations
    and registered callbacks.
  parameters: []
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Move ScriptMgr instance to new variable
    code: 'ScriptMgr&& sourceMgr = std::move(GetScriptMgr());

      ScriptMgr newMgr(std::move(sourceMgr));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move during object construction
    code: "class MyScriptHandler\n{\npublic:\n    MyScriptHandler() : mgr_(std::move(ScriptMgr::Instance()))\
      \ {}\nprivate:\n    ScriptMgr mgr_;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. After moving, the source
    object should not be used unless reassigned. The move operation is typically O(1)
    in complexity and avoids deep copying of script data structures.
  warnings: Attempting to use the moved-from ScriptMgr instance after this operation
    results in undefined behavior. Ensure all references to the original object are
    invalidated before calling this constructor.
