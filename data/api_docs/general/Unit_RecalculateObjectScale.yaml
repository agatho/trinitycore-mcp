documentation:
  brief: Recalculates the scale factor for the unit based on its current state and
    attributes.
  description: This method recalculates the object scale for a Unit, which affects
    how the unit appears in the game world. The scale is typically influenced by factors
    such as size, level, and other attributes that determine the visual representation
    of the unit. This method is commonly used when a unit's state changes or when
    its attributes are modified to ensure proper visual scaling. It may be invoked
    automatically during certain game events or manually by developers when needed.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during internal updates to ensure that the
    object scale reflects the current state of the unit. It may involve calculations
    based on various attributes such as size, level, and other modifiers.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect visual scaling
    of units in the game world, which may affect gameplay balance or visual representation.
