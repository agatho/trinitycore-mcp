documentation:
  brief: Sets the internal flag indicating whether an error message has been sent
    to the player.
  description: The SetSentErrorMessage method is used to update an internal boolean
    flag within the ChatHandler class that tracks whether an error message has already
    been dispatched to a player. This flag is typically used to prevent duplicate
    error messages from being sent during command processing, ensuring clean communication
    with players. The method accepts a single boolean parameter that determines the
    state of this flag. When called with true, it indicates that an error message
    has been sent; when called with false, it resets the flag to indicate no error
    message was sent yet.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Error Message Flag to True
    code: 'ChatHandler* handler = player->GetSession()->GetChatHandler();

      handler->SetSentErrorMessage(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting Error Message Flag
    code: 'ChatHandler* handler = player->GetSession()->GetChatHandler();

      handler->SetSentErrorMessage(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore command system
    to manage error reporting state. It's often called in conjunction with sending
    actual error messages to players to avoid duplicate notifications. The flag is
    not persistent across different command invocations and is reset automatically
    as needed.
