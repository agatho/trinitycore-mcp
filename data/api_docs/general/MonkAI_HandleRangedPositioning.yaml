  class: MonkAI
  method: HandleRangedPositioning
  signature: void MonkAI::HandleRangedPositioning(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the monk AI's positioning strategy based on target distance and combat
    requirements.
  description: The HandleRangedPositioning method in the MonkAI class adjusts the
    AI's movement and positioning behavior to maintain optimal range for ranged attacks
    or abilities. This method evaluates the distance between the monk AI unit and
    its target, determining whether it should move closer, retreat, or remain stationary
    to maximize effectiveness of its abilities while adhering to game mechanics such
    as attack range limitations and positioning requirements for certain monk skills.
    The method typically integrates with the broader AI decision-making loop to dynamically
    adapt combat positioning during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's ID or index in the
      combat system. This parameter is used to determine the distance and positioning
      requirements for the monk AI.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        HandleRangedPositioning(&targetId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI update loop and may influence
    movement, spell casting decisions, and positioning strategies. It assumes that
    a valid target exists and has been selected for combat.
