  signature: int32 Guardian::GetBonusDamage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the bonus damage value applied to the guardian's attacks.
  description: The GetBonusDamage method retrieves the total bonus damage that is
    added to the guardian's melee and ranged attacks. This value typically includes
    bonuses from various sources such as spell effects, auras, item enchantments,
    or other game mechanics that enhance damage output. The method is commonly used
    in combat calculations to determine the final damage dealt by the guardian during
    attack sequences. It does not modify any internal state and is purely a read operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the total bonus damage applied to the guardian's
    attacks. A positive value increases damage, zero means no bonus, and negative
    values may indicate debuffs or special game mechanics that reduce damage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Calculation
    code: 'int32 bonusDamage = guardian->GetBonusDamage();

      uint32 finalDamage = baseDamage + bonusDamage;

      // Use finalDamage in attack logic'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Active Bonus Effects
    code: "if (guardian->GetBonusDamage() > 0)\n{\n    // Apply visual effect or log\
      \ bonus damage\n    sLog->outString(\"Guardian has %d bonus damage\", guardian->GetBonusDamage());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method aggregates all applicable bonus damage sources, including temporary
    effects like buffs or debuffs. The value returned is typically updated whenever
    the guardian's state changes due to spell application or removal. It is recommended
    to cache this value if it's used frequently in performance-sensitive code paths.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned value represents only one source of bonus
    damage; it includes all active bonuses. Be cautious when using this method in
    combat loops where frequent calls may impact performance if not properly optimized.
