  class: WmoLiquid
  method: ~WmoLiquid
  signature: void WmoLiquid::~WmoLiquid()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a WmoLiquid instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~WmoLiquid destructor is called automatically when a WmoLiquid
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of memory and resources allocated for the liquid data within a WMO (World
    Map Object) group. It typically handles deallocation of internal buffers, release
    of texture references, and any other cleanup operations necessary to prevent memory
    leaks. In the context of TrinityCore's map loading system, this destructor plays
    a role in managing the lifecycle of liquid data that defines water surfaces, lava,
    or other liquid effects within WMOs.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of WmoLiquid object
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    WmoLiquid* liquid = new WmoLiquid();\n \
      \   // ... use the liquid object ...\n    delete liquid; // Destructor called\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects are
    destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless performing
    explicit memory management. The WmoLiquid class likely manages dynamic memory
    for vertex data, texture coordinates, and other rendering-related information
    that must be freed upon object destruction.
