  method: GetSlope
  signature: float NavMeshInterface::GetSlope(Map * map, const int & position) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the slope angle at a specified position within a given
    map's navigation mesh.
  description: The GetSlope method computes the slope angle (in radians) at a specific
    location on the navigation mesh for a given map. This is useful for determining
    terrain inclination, which affects movement behavior, line-of-sight calculations,
    and pathfinding decisions in World of Warcraft. The method takes a Map object
    and a position identifier, then returns the slope value representing how steep
    the ground is at that point. It's commonly used by AI systems to evaluate whether
    a character can traverse a particular area based on terrain steepness.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object containing the navigation mesh data where
      the slope will be calculated. Must not be null.
  - name: position
    description: Integer identifier representing a specific position within the map's
      navigation mesh. This typically corresponds to a node or point index in the
      navmesh data structure.
  returns: A float value representing the slope angle at the specified position, measured
    in radians. Positive values indicate an upward slope, negative values indicate
    a downward slope, and zero indicates flat terrain.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check slope for a character's current position
    code: "float slope = NavMeshInterface::GetSlope(map, position);\nif (slope > 0.5f)\
      \ {\n    // Character is on steep upward terrain\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using slope to determine if a path is traversable
    code: "float maxSlope = 0.785f; // ~45 degrees in radians\nfloat currentSlope\
      \ = NavMeshInterface::GetSlope(map, targetPosition);\nif (currentSlope < maxSlope)\
      \ {\n    // Path is navigable\n} else {\n    // Avoid this path due to steep\
      \ terrain\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh data structure, which
    must be properly initialized and loaded for accurate results. The position parameter
    should correspond to a valid node or point in the navmesh; invalid positions may
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect slope values.
  warnings: Ensure that the Map pointer is valid and the position identifier refers
    to an existing node in the navigation mesh. Using invalid parameters can cause
    crashes or return meaningless data. The returned slope value is in radians, not
    degrees, so conversion might be necessary for UI display or human-readable output.
