documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CharmInfo object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The CharmInfo destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated to a CharmInfo instance. This includes releasing references
    to any summoned creatures or pets that were under the charm effect, ensuring proper
    cleanup of the charm state within the game world. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when a CharmInfo object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It
    ensures no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur in the TrinityCore server's
    creature AI and pet management systems.

  - title: Automatic destruction of CharmInfo
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    CharmInfo* charmInfo = new CharmInfo();\n \
      \   // ... use charmInfo ...\n    delete charmInfo; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The CharmInfo destructor should not be called manually unless the object
    was dynamically allocated. It is part of the standard C++ RAII (Resource Acquisition
    Is Initialization) pattern used throughout TrinityCore for managing AI and pet
    states.
