    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a ray cast intersects with an object in the GroupModel.
  description: The IsInsideObject method performs a ray intersection test against
    the GroupModel's collision geometry to determine if a specified ray intersects
    with any object within the model. This method is typically used for determining
    if a player or object is inside a specific area or structure, such as checking
    if a character is standing inside a building or cave. The method returns an InsideResult
    enum indicating the outcome of the intersection test, and optionally provides
    the distance from the ray origin to the point of intersection (z_dist). This functionality
    is essential for game mechanics involving spatial awareness, collision detection,
    and area-based triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: ray
    description: An integer identifier representing the ray cast to test against the
      GroupModel. The value typically corresponds to a specific ray or direction used
      in the spatial query.
  - name: z_dist
    description: A reference to a float that will be updated with the distance along
      the z-axis from the ray origin to the intersection point if an object is hit.
      This parameter is only modified when the method returns a positive intersection
      result.
  returns: An InsideResult enum indicating whether the ray intersects with an object
    in the GroupModel. Possible values include INSIDE_OBJECT, OUTSIDE_OBJECT, or INTERSECTING_OBJECT
    depending on the outcome of the spatial query.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a ray intersects with a GroupModel
    code: "GroupModel model;\nint rayId = 12345;\nfloat distance;\nInsideResult result\
      \ = model.IsInsideObject(rayId, distance);\nif (result == INSIDE_OBJECT) {\n\
      \    // The ray intersects with an object in the model\n    std::cout << \"\
      Distance to intersection: \" << distance << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsInsideObject for area-based trigger detection
    code: "void CheckPlayerPosition(GroupModel& areaModel, float playerX, float playerY,\
      \ float playerZ) {\n    int rayId = GetRayIdFromPosition(playerX, playerY);\n\
      \    float zDistance;\n    InsideResult result = areaModel.IsInsideObject(rayId,\
      \ zDistance);\n    if (result == INTERSECTING_OBJECT) {\n        // Player is\
      \ inside a specific area or structure\n        HandlePlayerEnterArea(playerZ\
      \ - zDistance);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal ray casting algorithms optimized for TrinityCore's
    collision system. It may be computationally expensive when used frequently, especially
    on large GroupModels with complex geometry. The ray parameter should be precomputed
    or derived from a consistent coordinate system to ensure accurate results.
  warnings: Ensure that the ray identifier is valid and corresponds to an actual ray
    in the model's internal structure. Incorrect ray IDs may lead to undefined behavior
    or false positives. The z_dist parameter will only be updated if the method returns
    a positive intersection result; otherwise, its value remains unchanged.
