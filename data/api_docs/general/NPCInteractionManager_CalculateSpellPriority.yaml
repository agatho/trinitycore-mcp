  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: CalculateSpellPriority
  signature: float NPCInteractionManager::CalculateSpellPriority(const TrainerSpell
    * trainerSpell) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the priority value for a trainer spell based on various
    factors such as spell level, cost, and player progress.
  description: The CalculateSpellPriority method determines how important or relevant
    a specific trainer spell is to a player within the context of NPC interactions.
    This calculation considers multiple attributes of the spell including its required
    skill level, training cost, and whether it's already known by the player. The
    resulting priority value can be used to sort or filter spells in UI displays,
    helping players identify which skills to prioritize for training. The method is
    typically invoked when building a list of available trainer spells for display
    to the player. It does not modify any internal state and is purely a calculation-based
    function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated priority of the trainer spell.
    Higher values indicate higher priority, with the exact meaning of the scale depending
    on internal logic but generally reflecting how beneficial or urgent it is for
    the player to learn the spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Trainer Interaction
    code: "float priority = npcInteractionManager.CalculateSpellPriority(trainerSpell);\n\
      if (priority > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Display this spell as a high-priority option\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the NPC trainer system to determine
    spell ordering in UI elements like spell lists or recommendations. The exact algorithm
    for calculating priority may vary depending on game mechanics and player state,
    such as current skill levels, available gold, and quest progress.
