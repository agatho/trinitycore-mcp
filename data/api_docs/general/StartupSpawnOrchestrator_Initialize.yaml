  class: StartupSpawnOrchestrator
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool StartupSpawnOrchestrator::Initialize(SpawnPriorityQueue * priorityQueue,
    AdaptiveSpawnThrottler * throttler)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the startup spawn orchestrator with provided priority queue and
    throttler components
  description: The Initialize method sets up the StartupSpawnOrchestrator by assigning
    it a SpawnPriorityQueue for managing spawn priorities and an AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
    for controlling spawn rates. This method prepares the orchestrator for use in
    the game's startup sequence where creatures and objects are spawned. It ensures
    that all necessary dependencies are correctly linked before spawning operations
    begin. The initialization process may involve validating input parameters and
    setting internal state flags to indicate readiness. If initialization fails, subsequent
    spawn operations might not behave as expected.
  parameters:
  - name: priorityQueue
    description: Pointer to a SpawnPriorityQueue instance that manages the priority
      ordering of spawns during startup. Must be a valid, initialized object or nullptr.
  - name: throttler
    description: Pointer to an AdaptiveSpawnThrottler instance that controls spawn
      rate limiting and adaptive spawning behavior. Must be a valid, initialized object
      or nullptr.
  returns: Returns true if initialization was successful and all components were properly
    assigned; returns false if either parameter is null or if initialization fails
    due to invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "SpawnPriorityQueue* queue = new SpawnPriorityQueue();\nAdaptiveSpawnThrottler*\
      \ throttler = new AdaptiveSpawnThrottler();\nStartupSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;\n\
      bool success = orchestrator.Initialize(queue, throttler);\nif (success) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with spawn operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Null Check
    code: "SpawnPriorityQueue* queue = GetSpawnPriorityQueue();\nAdaptiveSpawnThrottler*\
      \ throttler = GetAdaptiveSpawnThrottler();\nStartupSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;\n\
      if (queue && throttler) {\n    bool success = orchestrator.Initialize(queue,\
      \ throttler);\n    if (!success) {\n        // Handle initialization failure\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize StartupSpawnOrchestrator\");\n\
      \    }\n} else {\n    // Handle missing dependencies\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the system's initialization
    phase. Reinitialization may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    orchestrator assumes ownership of the provided pointers and will manage their
    lifecycle appropriately. Performance is critical during startup, so this method
    should complete quickly to avoid blocking other systems.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for either parameter will result in a failed initialization
    and potential runtime errors if spawn operations are attempted afterward. Ensure
    that both parameters point to valid, initialized objects before calling this method.
    Avoid calling Initialize multiple times on the same instance without proper cleanup.
