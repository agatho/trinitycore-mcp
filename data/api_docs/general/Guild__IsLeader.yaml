api:
  class: Guild
  method: _IsLeader
  signature: bool Guild::_IsLeader(Player * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the specified player is the leader of the guild.
  description: The _IsLeader method determines whether a given Player object holds
    the leadership position within their guild. This internal method evaluates the
    player's guild rank and membership status to verify if they possess the highest
    authority level in the guild. It is typically used by other guild-related methods
    to enforce permissions and ensure that only the guild leader can perform certain
    actions such as promoting members, disbanning players, or modifying guild settings.
    The method does not perform any external API calls but relies on cached guild
    data and player rank information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is the guild leader; otherwise returns
    false. This indicates whether the player has the highest rank (typically Rank
    0) in the guild's hierarchy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (guild->_IsLeader(player)) {\n    // Perform leader-only actions\n \
      \   guild->SendGuildEvent(GuildEvent::LEADER_CHANGED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Permission Check Before Guild Action
    code: "void Guild::PromoteMember(Player* target) {\n    if (!_IsLeader(_leader))\
      \ {\n        // Send error message to player\n        return;\n    }\n    //\
      \ Proceed with promotion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly from outside
    the Guild class. The method relies on the guild's internal state and assumes that
    the player object passed in is a valid member of this guild. It does not perform
    any validation or error handling for invalid inputs.
  warnings: Do not use this method without ensuring that the player is actually a
    member of the guild, as it may lead to undefined behavior if the player is not
    properly associated with the guild. This method should only be used in contexts
    where the guild membership has already been verified.
