  method: CreateSpawnTimer
  signature: std::unique_ptr<class IBotPerformanceTimer> IBotPerformanceMonitor::CreateSpawnTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new performance timer for monitoring bot spawn operations.
  description: The CreateSpawnTimer method initializes and returns a unique pointer
    to a new IBotPerformanceTimer instance specifically designed for tracking the
    performance metrics of bot spawning activities. This timer can be used to measure
    the duration and efficiency of various bot creation processes within the TrinityCore
    environment. The returned timer object allows developers to start, stop, and query
    timing data for spawn-related operations. This method is typically invoked when
    monitoring or profiling bot behavior during server runtime, particularly in scenarios
    involving large-scale bot deployments or performance optimization efforts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::unique_ptr to an IBotPerformanceTimer object that represents a new
    timer instance specifically configured for monitoring bot spawn operations. The
    caller assumes ownership of the returned timer and is responsible for managing
    its lifecycle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of CreateSpawnTimer
    code: 'auto spawnTimer = performanceMonitor->CreateSpawnTimer();

      spawnTimer->Start();

      // Perform bot spawning operations here

      spawnTimer->Stop();

      std::cout << "Spawn time: " << spawnTimer->GetElapsedMilliseconds() << " ms"
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned IBotPerformanceTimer object is specifically tailored for measuring
    spawn-related performance. It's recommended to call Start() immediately after
    creation if timing is desired. The timer automatically handles internal state
    management and should not be manually deleted as it's managed by the unique_ptr.
  warnings: Ensure that the performance monitor instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as calling it on a null or uninitialized monitor may result
    in undefined behavior. Also, avoid creating multiple timers for the same operation
    without proper cleanup to prevent resource leaks.
