  class: Unit
  method: EngageWithTarget
  signature: void Unit::EngageWithTarget(Unit * who)
documentation:
  brief: Engages the target unit with the current unit, establishing combat and initiating
    AI behavior.
  description: The EngageWithTarget method initiates combat between the current Unit
    and the specified target Unit. It is used to start hostilities and trigger AI
    behaviors for the engaged unit. This method typically sets up the unit's combat
    state and ensures that the target is properly engaged in combat with the current
    unit. The method may also trigger related events such as AI activation, threat
    generation, or target selection.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: The target Unit to engage with. This parameter represents the unit
      that will be engaged in combat with the current unit. It must be a valid Unit
      pointer and cannot be nullptr.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      Unit* player = new Unit();

      player->EngageWithTarget(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = new Unit();\nUnit* player = new Unit();\nif (target != nullptr\
      \ && player != nullptr)\n{\n    player->EngageWithTarget(target);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle null pointer case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI contexts and may trigger additional combat-related
    behaviors. It should be called only when the unit is ready to engage in combat,
    as it may cause performance overhead if called frequently. The method does not
    directly handle combat mechanics but rather sets up the engagement state.
  warnings: Calling this method with a nullptr target can result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the target unit exists and is valid before calling this
    method. This method should only be used when the unit is in a state where combat
    is appropriate, such as when the unit is not in a safe zone or during an encounter.
