  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: ValidateSpawnLocation
  signature: bool BotSpawnerOptimized::ValidateSpawnLocation(uint32 mapId, float x,
    float y, float z)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given location is suitable for bot spawning on a specific
    map.
  description: The ValidateSpawnLocation method checks if a specified coordinate (x,
    y, z) on a given map is valid for spawning a bot. It evaluates factors such as
    terrain accessibility, collision detection, and map boundaries to ensure the spawn
    point is safe and appropriate for AI-controlled characters. This method is typically
    used during bot initialization or respawn processes to prevent bots from spawning
    in invalid locations like water, solid walls, or other impassable areas. The validation
    considers both the immediate vicinity of the coordinates and the overall map constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map where the spawn location is to be
      validated. Must correspond to a valid map in the game world.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the potential spawn location. Represents horizontal
      position on the map grid.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the potential spawn location. Represents vertical
      position on the map grid.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the potential spawn location. Represents elevation
      or height at the given point.
  returns: Returns true if the specified location is valid for bot spawning, false
    otherwise. A return value of false indicates that the location fails one or more
    validation checks such as being underwater, inside a solid object, or outside
    map boundaries.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (botSpawner->ValidateSpawnLocation(0, 1234.5f, 6789.0f, 100.0f)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with bot spawning\n    botSpawner->SpawnBot(0, 1234.5f, 6789.0f,\
      \ 100.0f);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative spawn location\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      world\", \"Invalid spawn location at (1234.5, 6789.0, 100.0) on map 0\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Batch Validation
    code: "std::vector<std::pair<float, float>> potentialSpawns = {{100.0f, 200.0f},\
      \ {300.0f, 400.0f}, {500.0f, 600.0f}};\nfor (const auto& spawn : potentialSpawns)\
      \ {\n    if (botSpawner->ValidateSpawnLocation(1, spawn.first, spawn.second,\
      \ 50.0f)) {\n        LOG_INFO(\"world\", \"Valid spawn point found at ({}, {})\"\
      , spawn.first, spawn.second);\n        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs several checks including line-of-sight validation, ground
    height detection, and collision avoidance. It may be computationally expensive
    when called frequently, especially on large maps with complex terrain. The implementation
    likely uses TrinityCore's navigation mesh system or similar spatial data structures
    to determine validity.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid location will always remain valid after calling
    this method, as dynamic world conditions (like terrain changes or object placement)
    could affect the result. Always validate spawn locations before attempting to
    actually spawn bots to avoid runtime errors or invalid game states.
