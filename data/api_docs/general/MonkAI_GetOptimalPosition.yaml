  class: MonkAI
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int MonkAI::GetOptimalPosition(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position for a Monk AI to perform actions
    based on target location and combat mechanics.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best spatial coordinates
    for a Monk AI character to execute abilities or movements in relation to a specified
    target. This method considers factors such as distance, line of sight, and combat
    positioning to ensure effective gameplay behavior. It is typically used within
    the Monk's AI logic to decide where to move or position itself during encounters.
    The method requires a valid target reference to calculate positioning, and may
    return different values depending on the current game state and environmental
    constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position
      index. Must be a valid reference to ensure proper calculation of optimal positioning.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal position index
    or identifier. A positive value typically indicates a successful calculation,
    while negative values may denote failure conditions such as invalid targets or
    unreachable positions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetOptimalPosition
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nint optimalPos = monkAI->GetOptimalPosition(&targetId);\n\
      if (optimalPos >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with movement to optimal position\n \
      \   printf(\"Optimal position: %d\\n\", optimalPos);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ error case\n    printf(\"Failed to calculate optimal position\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal AI pathfinding and combat calculation
    systems. Developers should ensure that the target parameter is valid before calling
    this function to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect positioning results.
  warnings: Calling GetOptimalPosition without a properly initialized target may lead
    to unpredictable outcomes or crashes. Always validate the target reference prior
    to invoking this method.
