  signature: int32 PlayerbotConfig::GetInt(const std::string & key, int32 defaultValue)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an integer configuration value by key, returning a default if the
    key is not found.
  description: The GetInt method retrieves an integer configuration value from the
    PlayerbotConfig instance using a specified key. If the key does not exist in the
    configuration, it returns the provided default value instead. This method is commonly
    used to access player bot settings such as behavior thresholds, timers, or numerical
    parameters that control bot decision-making logic. The configuration values are
    typically loaded at startup or dynamically updated during runtime based on user
    preferences or game state changes.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: A string identifier used to locate the desired integer configuration
      value in the playerbot configuration system. This key should match the configuration
      parameter name exactly as defined in the bot's configuration files.
  - name: defaultValue
    description: The fallback integer value to return if the specified key is not
      found in the configuration. This ensures that the calling code has a valid default
      value even when a configuration entry is missing.
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing either the configured value for the
    given key or the provided default value if the key does not exist in the configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving a bot combat threshold
    code: int32 combatThreshold = playerbotConfig.GetInt("Bot::Combat::HealthThreshold",
      30);
    language: cpp
  - title: Getting maximum number of followers
    code: "int32 maxFollowers = playerbotConfig.GetInt(\"Playerbot::MaxFollowers\"\
      , 5);\nif (maxFollowers > 10) {\n    // Handle invalid configuration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in the configuration store, which
    may involve string comparisons and potentially locking mechanisms depending on
    implementation. For performance-critical code paths, consider caching frequently
    accessed values rather than calling this method repeatedly.
  warnings: Ensure that default values are chosen appropriately to prevent unexpected
    behavior if configuration entries are missing. Also, be aware that configuration
    changes made at runtime may not immediately reflect in cached values if the system
    does not support live reloading of settings.
