  class: ChrCustomizationChoice
  method: operator==
  signature: bool ChrCustomizationChoice::operator==(const ChrCustomizationChoice
    & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ChrCustomizationChoice objects for equality based on their internal
    data members.
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    ChrCustomizationChoice object and another ChrCustomizationChoice object provided
    as a parameter. It returns true if all corresponding data members of both objects
    are equal, and false otherwise. This comparison is typically used to determine
    whether two customization choices represent the same selection in the character
    creation system. The method is const, meaning it does not modify either object
    during the comparison operation. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this functionality supports ensuring that duplicate or identical character
    customizations are properly identified and handled within the game logic.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: A const reference to another ChrCustomizationChoice object that this
      instance will be compared against for equality.
  returns: Returns true if all data members of this object and the right object are
    equal; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equality Check
    code: 'ChrCustomizationChoice choice1;

      ChrCustomizationChoice choice2;

      bool isEqual = (choice1 == choice2); // Returns true if both objects have identical
      data members'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (playerCustomization == defaultCustomization)\n{\n    // Apply default\
      \ customization settings\n    player->SetCustomization(defaultCustomization);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely compares internal identifiers, appearance data, or other
    unique properties that define a character customization choice. Since it's a comparison
    operator, performance should be efficient as it typically involves direct memory
    comparisons of the object members.
