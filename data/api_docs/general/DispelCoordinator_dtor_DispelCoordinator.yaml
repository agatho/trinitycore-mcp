documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DispelCoordinator instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the DispelCoordinator class is responsible for releasing
    any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the coordinator. This method
    ensures proper cleanup when a DispelCoordinator object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's spell system, this may involve
    cleaning up internal data structures related to dispel tracking and coordination
    between different spell effects. The destructor is automatically invoked by the
    C++ runtime when the object's lifetime ends.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of DispelCoordinator
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    DispelCoordinator coordinator;\n    // ... use\
      \ coordinator ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when coordinator goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of DispelCoordinator pointer
    code: 'DispelCoordinator* coordinator = new DispelCoordinator();

      // ... use coordinator ...

      delete coordinator; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a virtual function in the base class, ensuring proper polymorphic
    behavior if DispelCoordinator has derived classes. It should not throw exceptions
    to maintain exception safety. Developers should be aware that any cleanup performed
    in this destructor must not depend on other objects that might have already been
    destroyed during the shutdown sequence.
  warnings: Do not call the destructor directly unless you are explicitly managing
    memory through pointers. The destructor should only be invoked by the C++ runtime
    when an object is destroyed. Avoid calling it manually on stack-allocated objects
    as this leads to undefined behavior.
