  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: BuildDefaultZones
  signature: void BotWorldPositioner::BuildDefaultZones()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and constructs default zone data structures for bot positioning
    within the game world.
  description: The BuildDefaultZones method is responsible for setting up the foundational
    zone information used by the BotWorldPositioner class. This method typically initializes
    internal data structures that define the boundaries, properties, and navigation
    points of various zones in the game world. It prepares the system to accurately
    position bots within specific zones based on their assigned roles or behaviors.
    The method ensures that all necessary zone-related data is available before any
    bot positioning calculations are performed, making it a critical initialization
    step for the bot positioning system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Initialization
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      positioner.BuildDefaultZones();

      // Zone data is now initialized and ready for bot placement operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during the initialization phase
    of a bot system. It may perform expensive operations such as loading zone data
    from database or configuration files, so repeated calls could impact performance.
    The method assumes that the underlying game world data is already loaded and accessible.
  warnings: Calling this method after bots have already been positioned may result
    in inconsistent behavior or require additional synchronization logic. Ensure that
    no bot positioning operations are active when invoking this method.
