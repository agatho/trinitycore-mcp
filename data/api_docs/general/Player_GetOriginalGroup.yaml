documentation:
  brief: Returns the original group that the player was part of before any group changes.
  description: The GetOriginalGroup method retrieves the Group object that represents
    the player's original group membership before any modifications or reorganizing
    occurred. This method is particularly useful for tracking group assignments and
    understanding the player's initial group state. The returned Group object may
    be nullptr if the player was not originally in a group, or if the group has been
    destroyed or disbanded since the player's original group assignment. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining accurate group tracking during gameplay operations
    such as group reorganizing, raid management, or when players are moved between
    different group contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Group object representing the player's original
    group membership, or nullptr if the player was not originally in a group or if
    the group no longer exists. The returned Group object may be null if the player
    is not part of any group, or if the group has been destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Group* originalGroup = player->GetOriginalGroup();\nif (originalGroup !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Player was originally in a group\n    // Do something\
      \ with the original group\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player was not originally in a\
      \ group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method relies on internal player tracking mechanisms
    that store the original group assignment. It is important to note that this method
    may return nullptr if the group has been destroyed or disbanded, which can happen
    during normal gameplay operations such as raid progression or group reorganizing.
    Performance considerations: The method itself does not involve heavy computation
    but may require checking internal state variables for group validity.'
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in situations where group membership
    changes frequently, as it may return nullptr if the original group has been destroyed.
    Care must be taken to avoid using the returned Group pointer after it has been
    destroyed or disbanded, which could lead to memory access violations or undefined
    behavior.
