  class: PointMovementGenerator
  method: Deactivate
  signature: void PointMovementGenerator::Deactivate(int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the point movement generator, stopping any ongoing movement and
    preparing it for potential reuse.
  description: The Deactivate method is used to halt the execution of a PointMovementGenerator,
    effectively stopping any active movement towards a specified point. This method
    is typically invoked when an AI-controlled creature or unit needs to cease its
    movement behavior, such as when switching to a different AI state or when the
    movement target becomes invalid. The method ensures that internal state variables
    are reset and that the movement generator is properly deactivated for future use.
    It does not directly remove the movement from the unit's movement queue but rather
    signals that the current movement should be considered complete or canceled.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the owner of this movement generator,
      typically used to identify which entity is controlling the movement. This parameter
      is expected to be a valid pointer to an integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Example
    code: 'PointMovementGenerator* movementGen = new PointMovementGenerator();

      int ownerID = 12345;

      movementGen->Deactivate(&ownerID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system and is commonly used in
    conjunction with other movement-related methods. It's important to ensure that
    the owner pointer passed to this method is valid, as dereferencing an invalid
    pointer may lead to undefined behavior.
