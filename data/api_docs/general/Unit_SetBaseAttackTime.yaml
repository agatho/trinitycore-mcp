  class: Unit
  method: SetBaseAttackTime
  signature: void Unit::SetBaseAttackTime(int att, uint32 val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the base attack time for a unit's melee attacks.
  description: This method configures the base attack time (in milliseconds) for a
    unit's melee weapon attacks, which affects how frequently the unit can perform
    melee attacks. The base attack time determines the minimum delay between successive
    melee attacks and is crucial for balancing combat mechanics in World of Warcraft.
    This setting directly impacts the unit's attack speed and influences overall combat
    performance.
  parameters:
  - name: att
    description: The attack type (main hand, off hand, or ranged) to set the base
      attack time for. Valid values are 0 (main hand), 1 (off hand), and 2 (ranged).
  - name: val
    description: The base attack time value in milliseconds. This represents the minimum
      delay between attacks for the specified attack type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Main Hand Attack Time
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer();

      unit->SetBaseAttackTime(0, 2000);

      // Sets main hand attack time to 2 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Off Hand Attack Time
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer();

      unit->SetBaseAttackTime(1, 1500);

      // Sets off hand attack time to 1.5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the unit's combat behavior and should be used carefully
    when modifying attack speed for different attack types. The base attack time values
    are typically set based on weapon speed or character class specifications.
  warnings: Setting attack times too low may cause performance issues or make the
    unit appear to attack too frequently in combat. Care must be taken when setting
    values for different attack types to maintain game balance and prevent exploitation.
