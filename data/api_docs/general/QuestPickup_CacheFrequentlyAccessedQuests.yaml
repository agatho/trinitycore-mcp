documentation:
  brief: Caches frequently accessed quests for optimized performance in the QuestPickup
    system.
  description: The CacheFrequentlyAccessedQuests method preloads and stores quest
    data that is commonly requested by players into an internal cache. This optimization
    reduces database lookups and improves response times when handling quest-related
    interactions, particularly during high-traffic scenarios such as quest givers
    or quest completion events. The method typically runs during server initialization
    or periodic maintenance to ensure the most relevant quest information is readily
    available in memory.

  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    during server startup or periodic refresh cycles. It's designed to be thread-safe
    and should not be called manually unless specifically required for custom logic.
