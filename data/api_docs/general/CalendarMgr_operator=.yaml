  brief: Moves ownership of a calendar manager instance to another calendar manager
    instance.
  description: The move assignment operator for CalendarMgr transfers all resources
    and state from the source CalendarMgr object to the target object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where you want to efficiently transfer ownership
    of calendar data, such as event information, invitations, and related metadata,
    without performing deep copies. The source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this method supports efficient management of calendar-related data
    structures during gameplay operations like event creation, modification, or cleanup.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target CalendarMgr object, allowing for chaining of
    assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'CalendarMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with calendar data ...

      CalendarMgr targetMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Uses move assignment

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'CalendarMgr mgr1, mgr2, mgr3;

      // ... populate managers with data ...

      mgr1 = std::move(mgr2) = std::move(mgr3); // Chained move assignments

      // mgr2 is left in valid but unspecified state, mgr3 is also left in valid but
      unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation rather than a copy. It's important
    to understand that after calling this operator, the source object should not be
    used unless it's explicitly reset or reassigned. The implementation likely involves
    transferring pointers, smart pointers, or other resource handles from one instance
    to another without duplicating underlying data structures.
  warnings: Using the move assignment operator on a CalendarMgr object after it has
    been moved from can lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure that the source
    object is not used again unless it's been properly reset or reassigned. Be cautious
    when mixing move and copy operations in complex data flow scenarios.
