documentation:
  brief: Updates the priority levels of targets for bot threat management based on
    current combat state and AI logic.
  description: The UpdateTargetPriorities method recalculates and adjusts the threat
    target priorities for a bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically
    invoked during combat updates to ensure that the bot focuses on the most threatening
    or strategically important targets according to its AI behavior. It evaluates
    factors such as target health, proximity, threat level, and any defined priority
    rules set by the bot's configuration. The method does not directly engage targets
    but rather modifies internal target prioritization data structures used by the
    bot's threat management system.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    if (m_bot->IsInCombat())\n\
      \        m_threatManager->UpdateTargetPriorities();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the bot's AI update cycle and
    should not be invoked manually unless implementing custom threat management logic.
    It relies on the current state of the bot's target list and may have performance
    implications if called too frequently during high-intensity combat scenarios.
