documentation:
  brief: Initializes database ID sequences for garrison-related entities
  description: The InitializeDbIdSequences method sets up and initializes the database
    identifier sequences used by the Garrison system. This method ensures that all
    garrison-related entities such as buildings, followers, and missions are assigned
    unique sequential IDs from the database. It typically runs during server startup
    or when loading garrison data to maintain consistency in ID allocation across
    the game world. The method does not require any parameters and performs its operations
    internally using the TrinityCore database subsystem.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: GarrisonMgr::InitializeDbIdSequences();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. It's
    typically invoked automatically by the GarrisonManager during subsystem setup
    and shouldn't be manually called elsewhere in normal gameplay operations.
