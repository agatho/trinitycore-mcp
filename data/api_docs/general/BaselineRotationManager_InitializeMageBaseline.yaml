documentation:
  brief: Initializes the Mage baseline rotation with default spell priorities and
    combat behavior settings.
  description: The InitializeMageBaseline method sets up the foundational spell rotation
    logic for Mage characters within the TrinityCore framework. This method configures
    the default priority order for Mage spells, establishes combat behavior parameters
    such as mana management thresholds, and initializes core rotation variables required
    for optimal performance during both PvE and PvP encounters. It ensures that all
    Mage baseline rotations start with consistent settings regardless of character
    state or previous rotation configurations.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializeMageBaseline();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during character initialization or when
    switching to Mage specialization. It does not require any pre-existing rotation
    state and will overwrite any previous configuration.
