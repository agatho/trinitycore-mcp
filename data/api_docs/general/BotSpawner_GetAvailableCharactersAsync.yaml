  signature: void BotSpawner::GetAvailableCharactersAsync(uint32 accountId, const
    int & request, std::function<void (int)> callback)
documentation:
  brief: Asynchronously retrieves a list of available bot characters for a given account
    ID.
  description: The GetAvailableCharactersAsync method fetches all bot characters associated
    with a specified account ID in a non-blocking manner. It uses a callback mechanism
    to return the results once the data is retrieved from the database or internal
    storage. This method is typically used by the BotSpawner class to determine which
    characters can be spawned or managed for a specific player account. The request
    parameter likely serves as an identifier or context for the operation, while the
    callback function handles the asynchronous response. The method does not block
    the calling thread, allowing for efficient handling of multiple concurrent requests
    in a multi-threaded environment like TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the player account for which to retrieve
      available bot characters. Must be a valid, non-zero account ID present in the
      database.
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier used to track or contextualize this specific
      request. May be used for correlation or state management within the system.
  - name: callback
    description: A std::function object that will be invoked once the character data
      is retrieved. The callback receives an integer parameter representing the result
      status or count of available characters.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotSpawner spawner;\nuint32 accountId = 12345;\nint requestId = 0;\nspawner.GetAvailableCharactersAsync(accountId,\
      \ requestId, [](int result) {\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << result << \" available\
      \ bot characters.\" << std::endl;\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not block the calling
    thread. It relies on asynchronous database operations or internal caching mechanisms.
    The callback function may be executed on a different thread than where the method
    was called, so ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources within the
    callback.
  warnings: Ensure that the accountId provided is valid and corresponds to an existing
    account in the database; otherwise, the result may be empty or cause unexpected
    behavior. Be cautious about potential race conditions if modifying character data
    concurrently with this asynchronous operation.
