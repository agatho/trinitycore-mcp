  class: PathfindingManager
  method: CalculateAStarPath
  signature: PathResult PathfindingManager::CalculateAStarPath(const int & start,
    const int & goal, const PathRequest & request)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates an A* path between two points using the provided path request
    configuration.
  description: 'The CalculateAStarPath method computes a shortest path from a starting
    node to a goal node using the A* algorithm. It utilizes the PathRequest object
    to determine traversal rules, such as movement costs, node types, and other pathfinding
    constraints. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft''s TrinityCore
    for NPC movement, player navigation, and AI pathfinding. The result is returned
    as a PathResult which contains the computed path or indicates failure. Precondition:
    Both start and goal nodes must be valid and accessible within the current navigation
    mesh.'
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting node identifier for the path calculation. Must be a
      valid node index within the navigation mesh.
  - name: goal
    description: The destination node identifier for the path calculation. Must be
      a valid node index within the navigation mesh.
  - name: request
    description: Configuration object containing pathfinding parameters such as movement
      cost, node types, and traversal rules.
  returns: A PathResult object representing either a successful path with waypoints
    or an error state indicating failure to compute a valid path.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Calculation
    code: "PathRequest request;\nrequest.SetMovementCost(1.0f);\nPathResult result\
      \ = pathfindingManager.CalculateAStarPath(100, 200, request);\nif (result.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Process the computed path\n    for (auto& waypoint : result.GetWaypoints())\
      \ {\n        printf(\"Waypoint: %d\\n\", waypoint);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Pathfinding Failure
    code: "PathRequest request;\nrequest.SetMovementCost(1.0f);\nPathResult result\
      \ = pathfindingManager.CalculateAStarPath(100, 9999, request); // Invalid goal\n\
      if (!result.IsValid()) {\n    printf(\"Failed to calculate path\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    printf(\"Path calculated successfully\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs synchronous pathfinding and may block execution if the
    path is complex or the navigation mesh is large. Consider using asynchronous variants
    for performance-critical applications. The method assumes that the navigation
    mesh has been properly initialized and updated before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid node indices (start or goal) will likely
    result in undefined behavior or failure. Always validate node identifiers against
    the current navigation mesh before invoking this function.
