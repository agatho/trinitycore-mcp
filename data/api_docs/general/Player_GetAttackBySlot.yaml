  class: Player
  method: GetAttackBySlot
  signature: int Player::GetAttackBySlot(uint8 slot, InventoryType inventoryType)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the attack power value for a specified slot in the player's inventory.
  description: The GetAttackBySlot method retrieves the attack power value associated
    with a specific inventory slot. This method is commonly used to determine the
    weapon damage or attack power of items equipped in various slots such as main
    hand, off hand, or ranged weapons. It returns an integer value representing the
    attack power which can be used for calculations in combat mechanics and item evaluation.
    The method takes into account the player's level, equipment, and any applicable
    buffs or debuffs that may affect the attack power.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot identifier (uint8) representing the specific slot
      for which to retrieve attack power. Valid values include main hand, off hand,
      ranged, and other weapon slots.
  - name: inventoryType
    description: The inventory type (uint8) that specifies the type of inventory slot
      being queried. This parameter helps determine how to properly calculate the
      attack power for different types of equipment.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the attack power associated with
    the specified slot. The value can be positive or negative depending on item quality
    and player attributes, and may include bonuses from buffs or modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int attackPower = player->GetAttackBySlot(SLOT_MAINHAND, INVENTORY_TYPE_WEAPON);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'int attackPower = player->GetAttackBySlot(SLOT_OFFHAND, INVENTORY_TYPE_WEAPON);

      int totalAttack = player->GetAttackBySlot(SLOT_RANGED, INVENTORY_TYPE_WEAPON);

      int combinedAttack = attackPower + totalAttack;

      // Calculate total attack power for all weapon slots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    such as GetDamageBySlot or GetWeaponDamage. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific type of weapon and inventory slot being queried. Performance considerations
    include potential for multiple calls when calculating attack power across all
    weapon slots.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with different inventory types, as
    incorrect usage can lead to inaccurate combat calculations. Ensure that the slot
    parameter corresponds correctly to the actual weapon slot being evaluated.
