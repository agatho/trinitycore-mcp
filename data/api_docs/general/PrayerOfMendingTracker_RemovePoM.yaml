  class: PrayerOfMendingTracker
  method: RemovePoM
  signature: void PrayerOfMendingTracker::RemovePoM(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a Prayer of Mending effect from the specified target.
  description: The RemovePoM method is responsible for eliminating a Prayer of Mending
    buff from a player or creature identified by their GUID. This method is typically
    invoked when the buff expires, is dispelled, or when the caster chooses to remove
    it early. It ensures proper cleanup of the buff's effects and updates the internal
    tracking state accordingly. The method operates on the target specified by the
    GUID parameter and removes any active Prayer of Mending effect associated with
    that unit.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit from which the Prayer
      of Mending effect should be removed. This value must correspond to a valid player
      or creature in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Prayer of Mending from a Player
    code: 'PrayerOfMendingTracker tracker;

      tracker.RemovePoM(12345); // Removes PoM from player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target unit exists in the game world and has
    an active Prayer of Mending effect. It is typically called internally by the core
    system when buff expiration or removal events occur.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure the GUID corresponds to a valid unit before
    invoking this function.
