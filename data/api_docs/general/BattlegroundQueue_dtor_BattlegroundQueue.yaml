documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BattlegroundQueue instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BattlegroundQueue class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the queue's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any pending battleground invitations, removing queued players from
    internal data structures, and ensuring no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when a BattlegroundQueue object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of battleground queue
    management state before the object is fully destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Default destruction of BattlegroundQueue
    code: 'BattlegroundQueue* bgQueue = new BattlegroundQueue();

      // ... usage of bgQueue ...

      delete bgQueue; // Triggers ~BattlegroundQueue()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor
    unless performing explicit memory management. The cleanup process may involve
    notifying other subsystems about queue termination and clearing internal player
    lists.
