documentation:
  brief: Resets all internal metrics and counters used by the LineOfSightManager for
    tracking visibility calculations.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated performance and usage
    statistics within the LineOfSightManager. This includes resetting internal counters
    such as raycasts performed, successful hits, failed checks, and other diagnostic
    data that may have been collected during gameplay. The method is typically invoked
    to ensure clean state before starting new visibility assessments or to reset metrics
    after a profiling session. It does not affect the operational state of the manager
    itself, only its statistical tracking capabilities.

  notes: This method should be called sparingly in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve clearing internal data structures. It is safe to call from any
    thread that has access to the LineOfSightManager instance.
