  class: SmartScript
  method: RemoveStoredEvent
  signature: void SmartScript::RemoveStoredEvent(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a stored event from the SmartScript system by its unique identifier.
  description: The RemoveStoredEvent method removes a previously stored event from
    the SmartScript system using its unique identifier. This function is typically
    used to clean up or cancel events that are no longer needed, preventing them from
    executing at a later time. The method operates on the internal event storage mechanism
    of the SmartScript class, which manages AI behaviors for game objects such as
    creatures and game objects. It ensures that any event associated with the provided
    ID is completely removed from memory and will not be triggered during subsequent
    script execution cycles.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the stored event to be removed. This ID
      corresponds to an event previously registered with the SmartScript system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a Stored Event
    code: 'SmartScript* script = creature->GetAI();

      uint32 eventId = 12345;

      script->RemoveStoredEvent(eventId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Event Removal
    code: "SmartScript* script = creature->GetAI();\nif (creature->HasAura(SPELL_ID))\n\
      {\n    script->RemoveStoredEvent(54321);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the event ID passed exists in the SmartScript's
    internal storage. If an invalid or non-existent ID is provided, the behavior may
    be undefined or silently ignored. The operation is typically fast and does not
    involve complex memory management.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid event ID may lead to unexpected behavior
    or silent failures. Ensure that the event ID corresponds to a valid stored event
    before calling this function. This method should not be called from within an
    event handler that is currently executing, as it might cause issues with internal
    data structures.
