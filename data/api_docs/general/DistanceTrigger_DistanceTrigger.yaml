  class: DistanceTrigger
  method: DistanceTrigger
  signature: void DistanceTrigger::DistanceTrigger(const std::string & name, float
    distance)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new distance trigger with the specified name and detection
    distance.
  description: The DistanceTrigger constructor initializes a new instance of the DistanceTrigger
    class, setting up the trigger's identifying name and the distance threshold at
    which it will activate. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft AI
    scripts to define interactive zones or events that respond to player proximity.
    The distance parameter determines how close a player must come to the trigger
    before an associated event is fired. The trigger operates within the TrinityCore
    framework's event system, allowing for dynamic gameplay elements such as quest
    triggers, NPC interactions, or environmental effects based on player movement.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for this distance trigger. Used to distinguish
      between multiple triggers in the same area and is often used for debugging or
      script referencing.
  - name: distance
    description: The detection radius in yards at which the trigger activates. When
      a player enters this radius, the associated event will be triggered. Must be
      a positive floating-point value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distance Trigger Initialization
    code: 'DistanceTrigger trigger("quest_start_zone", 10.0f);

      // Creates a trigger named "quest_start_zone" that activates when a player comes
      within 10 yards.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Triggers with Different Distances
    code: 'DistanceTrigger enter_cave("cave_entrance", 5.0f);

      DistanceTrigger exit_cave("cave_exit", 15.0f);

      // Two triggers: one for entering a cave (5 yards), one for leaving (15 yards).'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during object initialization or when
    setting up AI behavior. The actual triggering mechanism is handled by the TrinityCore
    event system, which checks player positions against all registered triggers on
    a regular basis. Triggers are typically associated with specific game entities
    like NPCs or GameObjects.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same object instance,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the distance value is positive
    and reasonable for the intended gameplay context to avoid performance issues or
    unexpected trigger behavior.
