  class: MovementForces
  method: Remove
  signature: bool MovementForces::Remove(ObjectGuid id)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a movement force entry by its unique identifier from the internal
    collection.
  description: The Remove method attempts to delete a movement force entry identified
    by the provided ObjectGuid from the internal data structure used by the MovementForces
    class. This method is typically invoked when a movement force effect needs to
    be terminated or cleared, such as when a spell or aura expires, or when an object
    is removed from the game world. The operation ensures that any references to the
    specified movement force are eliminated, preventing further application of its
    effects. It returns true if the entry was successfully found and removed; otherwise,
    it returns false if no matching entry exists.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier (ObjectGuid) of the movement force to be removed
      from the collection.
  returns: True if the movement force with the specified ObjectGuid was found and
    successfully removed; false otherwise, indicating that no such entry existed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ObjectGuid forceId = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Spell>(12345);\nbool\
      \ success = movementForces.Remove(forceId);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Movement\
      \ force was successfully removed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Spell Effect Cleanup
    code: "void OnSpellEffectRemove(Spell* spell)\n{\n    ObjectGuid forceGuid = spell->GetCaster()->GetGUID();\n\
      \    if (movementForces.Remove(forceGuid))\n    {\n        // Notify the client\
      \ or perform cleanup\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"spell\", \"Movement force removed\
      \ for spell {}\", spell->GetSpellInfo()->Id);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal data structure used to store movement
    forces supports efficient lookup and removal operations, likely using a map or
    set indexed by ObjectGuid. The implementation may involve thread synchronization
    if accessed from multiple threads.
  warnings: Calling Remove with an invalid or uninitialized ObjectGuid may result
    in undefined behavior or failed lookups. Ensure that the identifier corresponds
    to a valid movement force before calling this method.
