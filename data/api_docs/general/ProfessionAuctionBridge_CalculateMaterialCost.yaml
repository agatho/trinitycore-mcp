  signature: uint32 ProfessionAuctionBridge::CalculateMaterialCost(int * player, uint32
    itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the material cost for a profession item based on player data and
    item ID.
  description: The CalculateMaterialCost method computes the total material cost required
    to craft or purchase a specific item within the context of World of Warcraft's
    profession system. It takes into account the player's current profession levels,
    available materials, and the item's requirements. This method is typically used
    in auction house functionality and crafting systems to determine pricing or resource
    needs. The method operates on internal data structures representing the player's
    profession state and item definitions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the player's profession
      data, including skill levels and available materials.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the item for which material cost is being calculated.
      Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total material cost in copper coins.
    A return value of 0 indicates either no materials are required or an error occurred
    during calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 cost = bridge.CalculateMaterialCost(playerData, 12345);\nif (cost\
      \ > 0) {\n    printf(\"Material cost: %u copper\\n\", cost);\n} else {\n   \
      \ printf(\"No materials required or error occurred.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction House
    code: "uint32 CalculateAuctionPrice(uint32 itemId, int* playerData) {\n    uint32\
      \ baseCost = bridge.CalculateMaterialCost(playerData, itemId);\n    // Apply\
      \ markup and taxes\n    return baseCost * 1.2f;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal profession databases and may involve
    complex calculations including item quality multipliers, skill level bonuses,
    and regional resource availability. Performance is generally acceptable for single-item
    calculations but could be significant when processing large batches of items.
  warnings: The player data pointer must be valid and properly initialized; otherwise,
    the method will likely crash or return incorrect values. Ensure that the itemId
    corresponds to an actual item in the game database to avoid undefined behavior.
