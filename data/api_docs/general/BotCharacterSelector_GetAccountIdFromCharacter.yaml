    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the account identifier associated with a specified character GUID.
  description: The GetAccountIdFromCharacter method is used to obtain the unique account
    identifier (AccountID) that owns a specific character within the TrinityCore database.
    This function takes a character's globally unique identifier (GUID) as input and
    returns the corresponding account ID. It serves as a lookup mechanism for associating
    player characters with their respective accounts, which is essential for managing
    permissions, access control, and account-related operations in the game server
    environment. The method assumes that the provided character GUID exists in the
    database and is valid; otherwise, it may return an invalid or unexpected value.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the character for which
      to retrieve the associated account ID. This value typically corresponds to the
      'guid' field in the 'characters' table within the TrinityCore database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the account identifier (AccountID) associated
    with the given character GUID. If no matching character exists, or if the input
    is invalid, the method may return zero or an undefined value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 accountId = botSelector.GetAccountIdFromCharacter(123456);\nif (accountId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Account ID for character is: \" << accountId\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Account Management Context
    code: "void ProcessCharacterAccess(int charGuid)\n{\n    uint32 accId = botSelector.GetAccountIdFromCharacter(charGuid);\n\
      \    if (accId != 0)\n    {\n        // Proceed with account-based operations\n\
      \        std::cout << \"Processing access for account: \" << accId << std::endl;\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        std::cerr << \"Invalid character GUID or no\
      \ account found.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a database query internally to fetch the AccountID
    from the 'characters' table using the provided character GUID. Developers should
    ensure that the character GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    character in the database to avoid incorrect results.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent character GUID may result in returning
    zero or undefined behavior. Always validate inputs before calling this method,
    especially when dealing with user-provided data.
