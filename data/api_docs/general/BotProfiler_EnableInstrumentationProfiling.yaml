  class: BotProfiler
  method: EnableInstrumentationProfiling
  signature: void BotProfiler::EnableInstrumentationProfiling(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables instrumentation-based profiling for bot behavior analysis.
  description: The EnableInstrumentationProfiling method controls whether detailed
    performance metrics and behavioral data collection is active for bots within the
    TrinityCore environment. When enabled, this feature allows developers and administrators
    to gather comprehensive profiling information about bot execution times, decision-making
    processes, and resource usage. This functionality is typically used during development,
    testing, or debugging phases to optimize bot AI behavior and identify performance
    bottlenecks. The method does not require any specific preconditions but should
    be called before initiating profiling sessions for accurate data collection.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean flag that determines whether instrumentation profiling
      is enabled (true) or disabled (false). When set to true, the system begins collecting
      detailed performance metrics and behavioral data from bots. When false, profiling
      data collection ceases and existing collected data may be cleared depending
      on implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Bot Profiling
    code: 'BotProfiler::EnableInstrumentationProfiling(true);

      // This enables detailed profiling of bot behaviors for analysis.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bot Profiling
    code: 'BotProfiler::EnableInstrumentationProfiling(false);

      // This disables profiling and stops data collection.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal profiling systems that track execution
    time, memory usage, and AI decision-making cycles. It may have performance implications
    when enabled, as additional overhead is introduced to collect metrics. The implementation
    might be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded bot environments.
  warnings: Enabling profiling can introduce noticeable performance overhead during
    runtime. It should not be left enabled in production environments without careful
    consideration. Additionally, disabling profiling while active sessions are running
    may result in loss of incomplete data.
