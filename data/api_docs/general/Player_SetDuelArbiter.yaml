  class: Player
  method: SetDuelArbiter
  signature: void Player::SetDuelArbiter(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the duel arbiter for a player to manage duel-related interactions.
  description: This method assigns a specific GUID as the duel arbiter for the player,
    allowing them to control the duel process and manage duel-related mechanics. The
    arbiter is typically used in duels where one player acts as the referee or mediator
    to ensure proper gameplay. This method is crucial for maintaining game balance
    during duels and ensures that players can properly handle duel requests and responses.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will act as the arbiter
      in the duel. This GUID must be valid and represent a player character in the
      game.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetDuelArbiter(12345);

      // This sets the arbiter to a player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other duel-related methods
    such as SetDuelStatus or SetDuelTimer. It's important to note that this method
    does not directly initiate a duel but rather sets up the arbiter for potential
    future duels.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state
    for duel interactions, typically when they are not in combat or in a duel status.
    Improper use can lead to game balance issues or unexpected behavior during duels.
