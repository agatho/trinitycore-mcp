    duration_secs, const std::string & reason, const std::string & author)
documentation:
  brief: Bans a player account or IP address for a specified duration with an optional
    reason and author.
  description: The BanAccount method is used to ban a player account or IP address
    in the World of Warcraft server. It supports banning by account name or IP address,
    with configurable duration, reason, and author information. The method returns
    an integer indicating success or failure status. This function typically interacts
    with the database to store ban records and may trigger in-game notifications or
    logging depending on server configuration. The ban takes effect immediately upon
    successful execution.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: 'Ban mode: 0 for account name, 1 for IP address. Determines how the
      target is identified.'
  - name: nameOrIP
    description: The account name or IP address to ban. Must be a valid string identifier
      matching an existing account or IP in the database.
  - name: duration_secs
    description: Duration of the ban in seconds. Zero indicates a permanent ban. Must
      be a non-negative integer value.
  - name: reason
    description: Reason for the ban, displayed to administrators and optionally to
      the banned player. Can be empty string if no reason is provided.
  - name: author
    description: Name of the administrator or system that issued the ban. Used for
      logging and tracking purposes.
  returns: Returns 0 on success, non-zero value on failure. Possible error codes may
    include invalid parameters, database errors, or failed permission checks.
  examples:
  - title: Ban account for 24 hours with reason
    code: int result = sWorld->BanAccount(0, "PlayerAccount", 86400, "Cheating detected",
      "AdminUser");
    language: cpp
  - title: Permanently ban IP address
    code: int result = sWorld->BanAccount(1, "192.168.1.100", 0, "Multiple account
      violations", "GMStaff");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts directly with the database to persist ban records.
    It should be used carefully as it affects player access and game state. The method
    may perform additional checks for administrative permissions before executing
    the ban operation.
  warnings: Using this method with invalid parameters or without proper authorization
    can lead to database corruption or unauthorized bans. Ensure that account names
    and IP addresses are validated before calling this function. Permanent bans (duration_secs
    = 0) should be used sparingly and only in severe cases.
