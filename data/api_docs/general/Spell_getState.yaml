  brief: Returns the current state of the spell
  description: The getState method retrieves the SpellState enum value that represents
    the current operational status of a spell instance. This method is commonly used
    to determine whether a spell is in progress, on cooldown, or has been interrupted.
    The returned state helps developers understand the spell's behavior within the
    game mechanics and can be used for various checks and validations during spell
    execution. The method does not modify any internal state but simply returns the
    current value.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SpellState enum value indicating the current status of the spell.
    Possible values include SPELL_STATE_NULL, SPELL_STATE_CASTING, SPELL_STATE_PREPARING,
    SPELL_STATE_DORMANT, and SPELL_STATE_FINISHED, which represent different stages
    of spell execution or cooldown.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Spell* spell = new Spell();\nSpellState state = spell->getState();\nif\
      \ (state == SPELL_STATE_CASTING)\n{\n    // Handle casting state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not require any synchronization. It simply
    returns the current state of the spell without modifying it, making it suitable
    for read-only operations.
