  class: GuildBankRightsAndSlots
  method: SetSlots
  signature: void GuildBankRightsAndSlots::SetSlots(int32 _slots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of slots available in the guild bank for this rights entry.
  description: The SetSlots method configures the slot count for a specific guild
    bank rights entry, determining how many slots a member or rank can access within
    the guild bank. This method is typically used in conjunction with other guild
    bank management functions to define permissions and storage limits for different
    guild members or ranks. The slot count directly affects how much inventory space
    is allocated to a particular guild member's access level. Changes made using this
    method are usually persisted in the database and take effect immediately within
    the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: _slots
    description: The number of slots to assign for this guild bank rights entry. Must
      be a non-negative integer value representing the available slot count. Negative
      values may result in undefined behavior or error conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Guild Bank Slots for a Rank
    code: 'GuildBankRightsAndSlots rights;

      rights.SetSlots(100);

      // This sets the number of slots to 100 for the associated guild bank rights
      entry.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Slot Count Based on Guild Rank
    code: "GuildBankRightsAndSlots* rights = sGuildBank->GetRightsForRank(guildId,\
      \ rankId);\nif (rights)\n{\n    rights->SetSlots(50);\n}\n// Updates the slot\
      \ count for a specific guild rank to 50 slots."
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal data structures that track guild bank
    permissions and should be called only when appropriate permissions are verified.
    The actual slot limit may be constrained by server configuration or maximum allowed
    values defined in the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: Setting negative slot values may cause unexpected behavior or errors.
    This method should not be called with invalid parameters without proper validation.
    Changes to slot counts might require synchronization across multiple systems if
    the guild bank is actively used.
