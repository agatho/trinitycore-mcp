documentation:
  brief: Automatically sells all junk items in the player's inventory.
  description: The AutoSellJunkItems method processes a player's inventory and automatically
    sells all items that are classified as 'junk' according to the game's criteria.
    This functionality is typically used by automated systems or scripts to clean
    up a player's inventory without manual intervention. The method iterates through
    the player's inventory, identifies junk items based on item quality, level, and
    other factors, and then sells them to the nearest vendor or NPC. It ensures that
    only items meeting the junk criteria are sold, preserving valuable equipment while
    clearing out low-value items.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      TradeSystem::AutoSellJunkItems(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the game's internal junk item detection logic which
    considers item quality, level requirements, and player's skill levels. It does
    not affect items that are bound or quest-related. The method should be called
    with a valid player pointer to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying the player pointer can result in
    crashes. Ensure that the player is in a valid state (not in combat, not in a taxi
    flight) before invoking this function to prevent unexpected behavior during inventory
    operations.
