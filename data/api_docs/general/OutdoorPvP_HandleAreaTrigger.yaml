  signature: bool OutdoorPvP::HandleAreaTrigger(Player * param0, int param1, bool
    param2)
documentation:
  brief: Handles area trigger events for outdoor PvP zones, determining if a player's
    movement triggers zone-specific gameplay mechanics.
  description: The HandleAreaTrigger method is responsible for processing area trigger
    events within OutdoorPvP zones. It evaluates whether a player's movement through
    a specific area should activate zone-based gameplay mechanics such as faction
    changes, quest updates, or territorial control modifications. This method typically
    gets invoked when a player enters or exits an outdoor PvP zone boundary, and it
    determines the appropriate response based on the current state of the outdoor
    PvP system. The method checks various conditions including player faction, zone
    ownership, and active PvP events to decide how to handle the area trigger event.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object that triggered the area trigger. This
      represents the player character whose movement initiated the event.
  - name: param1
    description: Integer identifier representing the specific area trigger that was
      activated. This value typically corresponds to a predefined trigger ID defined
      in the game's area trigger database.
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the area trigger is being entered
      (true) or exited (false). This determines the direction of the event and how
      the outdoor PvP system should respond.
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger was successfully handled and processed
    by the outdoor PvP system, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate
    that the trigger was not recognized, the player was in an invalid state, or the
    system could not process the event due to internal constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic area trigger handling
    code: "bool result = outdoorPvP->HandleAreaTrigger(player, 12345, true);\nif (result)\n\
      {\n    // Area trigger processed successfully\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Entered outdoor PvP zone\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced area trigger with faction handling
    code: "bool HandleAreaTrigger(Player* player, int triggerId, bool entering)\n\
      {\n    if (!player || !player->IsInWorld())\n        return false;\n    \n \
      \   // Check if player is in an outdoor PvP zone\n    if (player->GetZoneId()\
      \ != 3523) // Example zone ID\n        return false;\n    \n    // Process area\
      \ trigger based on faction and state\n    bool handled = outdoorPvP->HandleAreaTrigger(player,\
      \ triggerId, entering);\n    \n    if (handled && entering)\n    {\n       \
      \ // Update player's PvP status\n        player->UpdatePvPState();\n    }\n\
      \    \n    return handled;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the core game loop when area triggers
    are detected. The implementation may vary between different OutdoorPvP types (e.g.,
    Wintergrasp, Ashenvale). Developers should ensure that player state validation
    occurs before calling this method to prevent unexpected behavior. The method may
    modify player state and send updates to the client.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid player pointers or incorrect trigger
    IDs can lead to undefined behavior. Always validate that the player is in a valid
    outdoor PvP zone before invoking this method. Be aware that some area triggers
    might have side effects on quest states or faction reputation.
