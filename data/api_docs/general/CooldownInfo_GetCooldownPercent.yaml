  signature: float CooldownInfo::GetCooldownPercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the cooldown percentage remaining for a spell or ability
  description: The GetCooldownPercent method computes the current cooldown progress
    as a percentage value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 represents a fully ready
    ability and 1.0 indicates a completely on-cooldown ability. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with cooldown tracking systems to determine how much time
    remains before an ability can be used again. The calculation takes into account
    both the total cooldown duration and the elapsed time since the last use of the
    ability. This functionality is essential for UI elements that display cooldown
    timers, such as action bar buttons or spell indicators.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the cooldown progress. A
    value of 0.0 means the ability is ready to use, while a value of 1.0 indicates
    the ability is fully on cooldown.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Cooldown Display
    code: "void UpdateCooldownDisplay(Player* player, uint32 spellId)\n{\n    if (CooldownInfo*\
      \ cooldown = player->GetSpellCooldown(spellId))\n    {\n        float percent\
      \ = cooldown->GetCooldownPercent();\n        // Use percent to update UI element\n\
      \        printf(\"Cooldown: %.2f%%\\n\", percent * 100);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining Ability Readiness
    code: "bool IsAbilityReady(Player* player, uint32 spellId)\n{\n    if (CooldownInfo*\
      \ cooldown = player->GetSpellCooldown(spellId))\n    {\n        return cooldown->GetCooldownPercent()\
      \ <= 0.0f;\n    }\n    return true; // No cooldown means ready\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CooldownInfo object has valid cooldown data.
    It does not perform any validation checks on internal state and may return unexpected
    values if called on an uninitialized or improperly configured cooldown entry.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths,
    as it involves time calculations. Also ensure that the CooldownInfo object is
    valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
