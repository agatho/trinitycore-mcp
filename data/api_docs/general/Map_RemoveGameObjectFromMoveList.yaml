  class: Map
  method: RemoveGameObjectFromMoveList
  signature: void Map::RemoveGameObjectFromMoveList(GameObject * go)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a game object from the map's movement update list.
  description: The RemoveGameObjectFromMoveList method removes a specified GameObject
    from the internal tracking list used for movement updates on the map. This is
    typically called when a game object is no longer required to be updated as part
    of the map's dynamic movement system, such as when it is being destroyed or deactivated.
    The method ensures that the object will not be processed during subsequent map
    update cycles related to movement logic. This operation is essential for maintaining
    performance and preventing memory leaks in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the GameObject instance to be removed from the movement
      update list. Must not be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a GameObject from Movement List
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...; // Assume this points to a valid GameObject

      map->RemoveGameObjectFromMoveList(go);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal map management system and should only
    be called by core systems or when explicitly managing game object lifecycle. It
    does not destroy the GameObject itself; it only removes it from movement tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the GameObject pointer is valid and has been properly initialized
    before calling this function.
