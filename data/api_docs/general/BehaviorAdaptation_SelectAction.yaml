    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Selects an appropriate action for a bot based on its current state and GUID
  description: The SelectAction method determines the most suitable behavior or action
    for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. It takes into account the
    bot's unique identifier (GUID) and its current state to return a numeric action
    code that represents the next logical step in the bot's decision-making process.
    This method is typically used in AI-driven bot systems where behaviors need to
    be dynamically selected based on contextual factors such as health, target status,
    or environmental conditions. The returned action code can then be interpreted
    by the game engine to execute the corresponding behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character for which to select
      an action. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity in the game world.
  - name: state
    description: An integer representing the current state of the bot, which influences
      the selection of appropriate actions. Valid values typically represent different
      behavioral states such as idle, combat, moving, or fleeing.
  returns: Returns a uint32_t value representing the selected action code. This code
    corresponds to a specific behavior or command that should be executed by the bot.
    Possible return values may include constants like ACTION_IDLE, ACTION_COMBAT,
    ACTION_MOVE, etc., depending on the implementation details of the BehaviorAdaptation
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32_t action = behaviorAdaptation.SelectAction(botGuid, currentState);\n\
      if (action == ACTION_COMBAT) {\n    // Execute combat behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot AI Loop
    code: "void BotAI::Update() {\n    uint32_t action = behaviorAdaptation.SelectAction(GetGUID(),\
      \ GetState());\n    ExecuteAction(action);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI system and should be called frequently
    during bot updates to ensure responsive behavior. The implementation may cache
    previous selections or use state machines internally for performance optimization.
    Developers should ensure that the input GUID corresponds to an active bot entity
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid botGuid may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the bot exists and is properly initialized before calling
    SelectAction. The state parameter must be within expected ranges; out-of-bounds
    values could lead to incorrect action selection.
