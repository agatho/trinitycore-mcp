  brief: Closes the current gossip menu for the player, dismissing any open dialogues
    or interactions.
  description: The SendCloseGossip method is used to close the active gossip menu
    for a player character in World of Warcraft. This function is typically called
    when a player has finished interacting with an NPC's gossip options or when the
    server wishes to programmatically dismiss the current dialogue. The method ensures
    that any ongoing gossip interaction is properly terminated and the player's UI
    is updated accordingly. It does not require any parameters and performs no return
    operations. This method is commonly invoked after processing player choices in
    gossip interactions, ensuring clean state management for NPC dialogues.

      \ after processing\n    player->PlayerMenu->SendCloseGossip();\n}"

      \ quest acceptance logic\n    // ...\n    \n    // Close the gossip menu to\
      \ clear the interface\n    player->PlayerMenu->SendCloseGossip();\n}"

  notes: This method directly affects the player's user interface state and should
    be called only when appropriate to avoid disrupting ongoing interactions. The
    method is part of the PlayerMenu class which manages all gossip-related UI elements
    for players in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Calling SendCloseGossip without proper context may leave the player in
    an inconsistent UI state. Ensure that this method is only invoked after completing
    or canceling a valid gossip interaction to prevent unexpected behavior.
