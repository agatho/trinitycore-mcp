  signature: void AzeriteEmpoweredItem::DeleteFromDB(int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an azerite empowered item entry from the database
  description: The DeleteFromDB method removes a specific azerite empowered item entry
    from the database using the provided transaction and item identifier. This method
    is typically used when an azerite empowered item is destroyed, sold, or otherwise
    removed from a player's inventory. The operation may be performed within a database
    transaction to ensure data consistency. The method does not return any value but
    directly modifies the database state.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Optional database transaction handle. If provided, the deletion will
      be part of this transaction. If null or invalid, the operation may use a standalone
      transaction.
  - name: item
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the azerite empowered item to be
      deleted from the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = ...; // Get a valid azerite empowered item

      item->DeleteFromDB(nullptr, item->GetGUID());'
    language: cpp
  - title: With Transaction
    code: 'TransactionPtr trans = new Transaction();

      AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = ...;

      item->DeleteFromDB(trans, item->GetGUID());

      // Commit transaction later

      trans->Execute();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the database and should be used carefully
    to avoid data inconsistency. It is recommended to validate that the item exists
    before calling this method. The method may throw exceptions if the database operation
    fails.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation can lead to dangling references
    or database corruption. Ensure that all related data (such as azerite powers,
    item sockets, etc.) are also cleaned up appropriately before calling this method.
