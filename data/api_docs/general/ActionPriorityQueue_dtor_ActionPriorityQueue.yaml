  signature: void ActionPriorityQueue::~ActionPriorityQueue()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ActionPriorityQueue instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the ActionPriorityQueue class is responsible for
    cleaning up all dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the queue.
    This includes freeing any action nodes that were added to the queue, ensuring
    no memory leaks occur when the queue goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor ensures proper cleanup
    of queued actions that are managed by the priority queue structure, which is commonly
    used in NPC behavior scripting and decision-making systems.

  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'ActionPriorityQueue* queue = new ActionPriorityQueue();

      // ... add actions to queue ...

      delete queue; // Triggers ~ActionPriorityQueue()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-Allocated Queue Destruction
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    ActionPriorityQueue queue;\n    // ... use queue\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this destructor should not
    be called manually unless the object was allocated with 'new'. The implementation
    likely handles cleanup of internal data structures such as linked lists or heap-based
    priority queues.
