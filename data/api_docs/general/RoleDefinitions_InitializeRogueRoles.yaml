  class: RoleDefinitions
  method: InitializeRogueRoles
  signature: void RoleDefinitions::InitializeRogueRoles()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the role definitions for rogue classes within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The InitializeRogueRoles method sets up and configures all necessary
    role-related data structures and mappings specific to rogue characters in World
    of Warcraft. This includes defining default roles such as Subtlety, Assassination,
    and Outlaw, along with their associated abilities, talents, and gameplay mechanics.
    The method ensures that rogue-specific role configurations are properly loaded
    into memory for use during character creation, class specialization changes, and
    gameplay interactions. It typically runs during server initialization or when
    a new rogue character is created to establish the foundational role framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

    code: 'RoleDefinitions roleDefs;

      roleDefs.InitializeRogueRoles();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or character
    initialization. It modifies internal data structures and must not be invoked concurrently
    with other role-related operations to maintain data integrity.
  warnings: Invoking this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or inconsistent role configurations. Ensure that all existing rogue
    role data is properly cleared before calling this method again.
