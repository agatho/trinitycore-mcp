  class: QuestStrategy
  method: ShouldWanderInQuestArea
  signature: bool QuestStrategy::ShouldWanderInQuestArea(BotAI * ai, const int & objective)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot should wander within the quest area based on the
    current objective.
  description: The ShouldWanderInQuestArea method evaluates if the bot's AI should
    allow wandering behavior within the active quest zone. This decision is typically
    made based on the current quest objective and the bot's state in relation to that
    objective. The method takes into account whether the bot has completed the necessary
    steps for the current quest or if it should remain focused on specific quest-related
    activities such as targeting NPCs or collecting items. It is used by the AI system
    to control movement behavior during quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the bot's behavior and state.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to an integer representing the current quest objective
      index or identifier.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should wander within the quest area, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether wandering behavior is allowed for the given quest objective.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest AI logic
    code: "if (strategy.ShouldWanderInQuestArea(ai, currentObjective)) {\n    ai->SetBehavior(BotBehavior::WANDER);\n\
      } else {\n    ai->SetBehavior(BotBehavior::QUEST_FOLLOW);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking wander permission before movement
    code: "bool canWander = strategy.ShouldWanderInQuestArea(ai, questObjective);\n\
      if (canWander && !ai->IsInCombat()) {\n    ai->MoveToRandomPosition();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest strategy system and integrates with the
    bot's AI decision-making process. It may be called frequently during quest updates,
    so performance should be considered when implementing custom logic.
  warnings: Ensure that ai and objective parameters are valid before calling this
    method to prevent undefined behavior or crashes. Incorrect handling of the objective
    parameter might lead to unexpected wandering behavior.
