  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: UpdateZonePopulation
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::UpdateZonePopulation(uint32 zoneId, uint32
    mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot population count for a specified zone and map.
  description: The UpdateZonePopulation method is responsible for maintaining accurate
    bot population data within a specific zone of a given map. This method is typically
    invoked when bot activity changes in a zone, such as when bots are spawned, despawned,
    or when their behavior is modified. It ensures that the internal tracking systems
    reflect the current state of bot presence in the game world, which may be used
    for various purposes including balancing, quest progression, or AI behavior adjustments.
    The method likely updates internal counters or data structures related to zone-specific
    bot populations.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone within the map where bot population
      is to be updated. This value corresponds to a specific geographic area in the
      game world.
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map containing the specified zone. This
      helps distinguish between different zones that may share the same zoneId but
      exist on different maps (e.g., instances).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update bot population for a specific zone
    code: BotPopulationManager::UpdateZonePopulation(1234, 5678);
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic population update during gameplay
    code: "void OnBotSpawned(uint32 zoneId, uint32 mapId)\n{\n    BotPopulationManager::UpdateZonePopulation(zoneId,\
      \ mapId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during gameplay to maintain real-time
    population data. It may interact with internal caching mechanisms or database
    systems to persist changes. The implementation might involve thread synchronization
    if called from multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that zoneId and mapId values are valid before calling this method,
    as invalid identifiers could lead to incorrect data updates or potential crashes.
    This method should not be invoked during critical sections where data consistency
    is paramount without proper locking mechanisms.
