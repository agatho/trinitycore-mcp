  class: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  method: SendAllData
  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::SendAllData(const int * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends all quest objective criteria data to the specified receiver.
  description: The SendAllData method is responsible for transmitting complete quest
    objective criteria information to a designated player or client. This method typically
    handles serialization and network transmission of quest progress data, ensuring
    that the client has up-to-date information about active quests and their completion
    requirements. It's commonly used during player login, quest updates, or when specific
    quest data needs to be refreshed in the user interface. The method operates on
    the internal criteria manager's stored data and sends it through the appropriate
    network protocol to maintain synchronization between server and client states.
  parameters:
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the integer identifier of the receiving client or player.
      This parameter specifies which entity should receive the quest objective criteria
      data. The value typically represents a player's session ID or connection handle
      used for network communication.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Quest Objective Data to a Player
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::SendAllData(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Data During Player Login Process
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    // Send all quest objective\
      \ criteria data to the newly logged in player\n    QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::SendAllData(&player->GetSession()->GetAccountId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs serialization of internal quest criteria data
    structures and sends them over the network using TrinityCore's packet system.
    It should only be called when the receiver is properly connected and authenticated.
    The method may internally iterate through all active quests for the specified
    player to gather complete criteria information.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null receiver pointer could result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the receiver parameter points to
    a valid, connected client session before invoking this method. This method should
    not be called during critical sections where data consistency is paramount.
