documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of player runes based on elapsed time
  description: The UpdateRunes method manages the regeneration and cooldown states
    of player runes in the game. This method is typically called during game loop
    updates to process rune regeneration timers, ensuring that runes are properly
    restored over time according to game mechanics. It handles the internal state
    management for each rune type (such as blood, frost, unholy, and death runes)
    and updates their availability based on the time elapsed since the last update.
    The method operates on a per-player basis and is integral to the proper functioning
    of Death Knight abilities that require rune resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update all players' resources\n\
      \    for (auto& player : m_players)\n    {\n        if (player->IsAlive())\n\
      \            player->GetResourceManager()->UpdateRunes(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active players who are alive and have
    a valid resource manager. The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds elapsed
    since last update, which is typically provided by the game's main update loop.
    Rune regeneration follows specific game rules where each rune type has its own
    cooldown timer that resets based on player level and equipment bonuses.
  warnings: Do not call this method on dead players or players without a valid resource
    manager instance. Improper handling of the 'diff' parameter can cause incorrect
    rune regeneration rates, potentially leading to gameplay imbalance or unexpected
    behavior in Death Knight abilities.
