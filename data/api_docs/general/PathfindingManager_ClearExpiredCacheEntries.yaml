documentation:
  brief: Removes cached pathfinding entries that have exceeded their expiration time
  description: The ClearExpiredCacheEntries method is responsible for cleaning up
    the pathfinding cache by removing entries that are older than the configured expiration
    threshold. This method ensures that the pathfinding system maintains optimal performance
    by preventing the cache from growing indefinitely. It typically runs periodically
    as part of the game's maintenance routines to free up memory and maintain cache
    efficiency. The method operates on the internal cache structure of the PathfindingManager,
    iterating through cached paths and discarding those marked for removal due to
    age.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    sPathfindingManager->ClearExpiredCacheEntries();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the game's main update loop
    or maintenance scheduler. It's designed to be thread-safe and should not block
    other pathfinding operations during execution. The expiration time threshold is
    configurable through server settings.
