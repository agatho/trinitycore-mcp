  method: GetResourceStarvationTime
  signature: uint32 ResourceMonitor::GetResourceStarvationTime(ResourceType type)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time in seconds until a specified resource type
    becomes depleted based on current consumption rate.
  description: The GetResourceStarvationTime method determines how long a given resource
    type will last before it is completely consumed, based on the current rate of
    usage. This method is typically used by the game engine to provide warnings or
    notifications when players are approaching resource exhaustion. The calculation
    takes into account the current resource amount and the rate at which that resource
    is being consumed over time. It's commonly used for mana, health, or other consumable
    resources in World of Warcraft-style gameplay mechanics. The method assumes a
    steady consumption rate and does not account for temporary buffs, debuffs, or
    changes in consumption behavior during the calculation period.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of seconds until the specified
    resource type reaches zero. If the resource is already at zero or below, the method
    returns 0. If the resource is infinite or not tracked by the monitor, it may return
    a large value or 0 depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Check mana starvation time
    code: "uint32 manaStarvationTime = resourceMonitor->GetResourceStarvationTime(ResourceType::MANA);\n\
      if (manaStarvationTime < 30)\n{\n    // Notify player that mana will run out\
      \ soon\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Your mana is running low!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine resource sustainability for AI decision making
    code: "ResourceMonitor* monitor = player->GetResourceMonitor();\nuint32 healthTime\
      \ = monitor->GetResourceStarvationTime(ResourceType::HEALTH);\nuint32 manaTime\
      \ = monitor->GetResourceStarvationTime(ResourceType::MANA);\n\nif (healthTime\
      \ > 60 && manaTime > 30)\n{\n    // Player can safely continue with current\
      \ strategy\n    player->SetAIState(AIState::CONTINUOUS_CASTING);\n}\nelse if\
      \ (healthTime <= 10)\n{\n    // Player should seek healing immediately\n   \
      \ player->SetAIState(AIState::FLEE_TO_HEAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate tracking of resource consumption rates. The
    implementation may cache recent consumption data to improve performance, but this
    can lead to slight inaccuracies during rapid changes in resource usage patterns.
    The method should be called periodically rather than on every tick for optimal
    performance.
  warnings: The returned time value is an estimate based on current consumption rate
    and does not account for future changes in behavior or external factors such as
    temporary resource regeneration effects. Using this value for critical game logic
    decisions without additional validation may lead to unexpected behavior during
    gameplay transitions.
