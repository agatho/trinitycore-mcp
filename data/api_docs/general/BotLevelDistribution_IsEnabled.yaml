  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool BotLevelDistribution::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot level distribution system is currently enabled
    in the TrinityCore server.
  description: The IsEnabled method checks the active state of the bot level distribution
    feature within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality controls whether
    bots are assigned levels according to a predefined distribution pattern or if
    they follow standard level assignment rules. The method returns a boolean value
    indicating the current operational status of this system. This check is typically
    used by other subsystems to conditionally apply bot-leveling logic during character
    creation, respawn, or when processing bot behavior modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot level distribution system is enabled and active;
    otherwise returns false if the system is disabled or not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Bot Level Distribution is Enabled
    code: "if (BotLevelDistribution::IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with bot level\
      \ distribution logic\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Bot level distribution is enabled.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Use default level assignment\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"\
      Bot level distribution is disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses a static configuration flag or singleton state
    variable that determines the global status of bot level distribution. It should
    be fast and thread-safe as it's expected to be called frequently during bot initialization
    and gameplay loops.
