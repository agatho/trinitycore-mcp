  method: Reset
  signature: void ThreatCoordinationMetrics::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all threat coordination metrics to their initial state.
  description: The Reset method clears and initializes all internal tracking data
    within the ThreatCoordinationMetrics class. This method is typically invoked when
    a new combat encounter begins or when threat tracking needs to be restarted from
    scratch. It ensures that previous threat values, counters, and statistical data
    are cleared, allowing for accurate measurement of threat generated during subsequent
    combat events. The reset operation does not affect the configuration or settings
    of the metrics system itself, only the accumulated data.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Start
    code: "void OnCombatStart()\n{\n    threatMetrics.Reset();\n    // Threat tracking\
      \ is now initialized for new combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting a new combat encounter to ensure
    clean threat data. It's recommended to call Reset() at the beginning of each new
    fight to avoid carryover from previous encounters.
