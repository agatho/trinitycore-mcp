  class: GroupEventBus
  method: ProcessGroupEvents
  signature: uint32 GroupEventBus::ProcessGroupEvents(int groupGuid, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes group events for the specified group GUID within the given time
    difference.
  description: The ProcessGroupEvents method handles the execution of queued group-related
    events for a specific group identified by its GUID. It is typically invoked during
    game loop updates to ensure timely processing of group activities such as member
    joins, leaves, invitations, or other group state changes. The method processes
    events up to a maximum time interval defined by the 'diff' parameter, which represents
    milliseconds since last update. This ensures that group events are handled in
    a timely manner without blocking the main game loop. The method returns the number
    of events processed during this call.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group whose events need to be
      processed. Must be a valid group GUID in the game world.
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since last event processing. Used
      to determine how much time has passed and how many events can be safely processed
      within that timeframe.
  returns: Returns the number of group events successfully processed during this call.
    A value of zero indicates no events were pending or processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: 'uint32 eventsProcessed = groupEventBus.ProcessGroupEvents(player->GetGroup()->GetGUID(),
      diff);

      // Processed ''eventsProcessed'' number of group events for the player''s current
      group'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing events with error handling
    code: "if (player->GetGroup()) {\n    uint32 processed = groupEventBus.ProcessGroupEvents(player->GetGroup()->GetGUID(),\
      \ 50);\n    if (processed > 0) {\n        // Log or handle successful event\
      \ processing\n        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Processed %u group\
      \ events for group %u\", processed, player->GetGroup()->GetGUID());\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called regularly from the main game loop or
    update handlers. It's important that the group GUID passed is valid and corresponds
    to an active group in the world. The 'diff' parameter should reflect actual elapsed
    time since last processing to avoid over-processing events.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or non-existent group GUIDs as it
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group exists and is
    valid before invoking this function.
