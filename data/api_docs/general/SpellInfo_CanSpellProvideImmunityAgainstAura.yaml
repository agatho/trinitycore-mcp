    auraSpellInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell can provide immunity against a specific aura type.
  description: This method checks if the current spell can provide immunity against
    a given aura spell, typically used in spell interaction and resistance calculations.
    It evaluates whether the spell's effects can prevent or neutralize the impact
    of another spell's aura, particularly in cases involving debuffs or negative effects.
    The method is crucial for determining spell interactions, especially when dealing
    with immunity mechanics such as those found in defensive spells or anti-debuff
    abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell can provide immunity against the specified aura;
    otherwise false. This indicates that the spell's effect can neutralize or prevent
    the given aura from affecting the target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->CanSpellProvideImmunityAgainstAura(auraSpellInfo)) {\n \
      \   // Spell provides immunity against aura\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in spell interaction logic, particularly when
    checking for immunity between spells. It may be called during spell processing
    or when evaluating spell effects. Performance considerations include avoiding
    unnecessary calls to this method during active combat situations.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without proper context; it's primarily
    intended for internal spell handling and should be used carefully in conjunction
    with other spell evaluation methods.
