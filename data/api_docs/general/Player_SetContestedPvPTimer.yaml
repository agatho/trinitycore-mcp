documentation:
  brief: Sets the contested PvP timer for the player, which determines how long a
    player remains in PvP status after being flagged.
  description: This method sets the contested PvP timer for a player, controlling
    the duration of time they remain in PvP status after being flagged. The timer
    is typically used to determine how long a player must remain in PvP status before
    their faction is reset to neutral. This timer affects the player's ability to
    engage in PvP combat and determines when they can return to normal faction status.
    The method is usually called during PvP flagging or when a player is about to
    enter a PvP zone.
  parameters:
  - name: newTime
    description: The new time value in milliseconds that the contested PvP timer should
      be set to. This represents how long the player will remain in PvP status after
      being flagged.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Contested PvP Timer
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetContestedPvPTimer(30000); // Set timer to 30 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the game engine when handling
    PvP flagging events. The timer value is usually set based on game mechanics and
    may be influenced by player level, faction status, or other factors.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without understanding of the
    game mechanics involved in PvP flagging. Incorrect usage can lead to improper
    PvP status handling and potentially affect player behavior.
