documentation:
  brief: Sets the delivery time for new mail in the player's inbox.
  description: This method configures the delivery time for new mail messages that
    will be added to the player's mailbox. It is used to schedule when new mail should
    become available for retrieval by the player, typically in relation to game mechanics
    such as mail delivery delays or cooldown periods. The method does not immediately
    deliver mail but rather sets a future time when mail will be delivered.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Mail Delivery Time
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();


      // Set mail delivery time to 1 hour from now

      time_t deliver_time = time(NULL) + 3600;

      player->AddNewMailDeliverTime(deliver_time);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other mail-related methods
    to control the timing of mail delivery. It may be called internally by game systems
    when creating new mail items, or manually by developers when implementing custom
    mail behavior.
