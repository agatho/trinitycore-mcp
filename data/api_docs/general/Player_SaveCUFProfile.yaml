  class: Player
  method: SaveCUFProfile
  signature: void Player::SaveCUFProfile(uint8 id, int profile)
documentation:
  brief: Saves a CUF (Compact Unit Frame) profile for the player with the specified
    ID and profile index.
  description: 'The SaveCUFProfile method persists a Compact Unit Frame configuration
    for the player. This function is typically used to store custom layout settings
    for unit frames such as player, target, focus, etc. The method takes two parameters:
    an identifier for the specific frame type (id) and a profile index that determines
    which saved configuration to use. It''s part of TrinityCore''s UI customization
    system that allows players to save multiple layouts for their unit frames. This
    method likely interacts with the database to store these settings so they persist
    across sessions.'
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The identifier for the specific CUF frame type. This typically corresponds
      to different unit frames like player, target, focus, etc. Valid values are usually
      defined by constants or enums in the TrinityCore codebase.
  - name: profile
    description: The profile index to save the configuration to. This allows multiple
      saved layouts for the same frame type. Negative values may indicate special
      handling or default profiles.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Save Player Frame Profile
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SaveCUFProfile(0, 1); // Save current player frame layout to profile
      1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Save Target Frame Profile
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SaveCUFProfile(1, 3); // Save target frame layout to profile 3'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely tied to the database storage system in TrinityCore.
    The actual saving mechanism may involve database transactions and could be asynchronous
    depending on implementation. It's designed for UI customization and should only
    be called when frame configurations have been modified by the user.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of parameters may result
    in invalid profile data being saved. Ensure that the id parameter corresponds
    to valid CUF frame types and that profile indices are within expected ranges to
    avoid database corruption or unexpected behavior.
