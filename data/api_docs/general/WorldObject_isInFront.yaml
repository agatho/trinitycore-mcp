  class: WorldObject
  method: isInFront
  signature: bool WorldObject::isInFront(const WorldObject * target, float arc) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the object is within the front arc of another object.
  description: The isInFront method determines whether the current WorldObject is
    positioned in front of a target object within a specified angular arc. This method
    is commonly used in game mechanics to verify line-of-sight or positioning for
    combat actions, spell casting, and AI behavior. It evaluates the relative orientation
    between two objects using the angle between their facing directions and the target
    object's position.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target WorldObject against which the front check is
      performed. This object defines the reference point for determining front orientation.
  - name: arc
    description: The angular arc in radians within which the front check is performed.
      This parameter typically represents the field of view or angle of attack, usually
      ranging from 0 to Math_PI (3.14159) radians.
  returns: Returns true if the current object is positioned within the specified arc
    in front of the target object; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->isInFront(target, M_PI_2)) {\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (npc->isInFront(player, 0.5f * M_PI)) {\n    // Perform attack or spell\
      \ casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on angle calculations between objects and does not account
    for obstacles or line-of-sight. It should be used in conjunction with other methods
    such as isInFront or isInLineOfSight to ensure accurate positioning checks.
  warnings: This method may produce false positives if the target object is at a significant
    distance, as it only checks angular orientation without considering physical barriers
    or distance. Always verify with additional mechanics when using for combat or
    spell targeting.
