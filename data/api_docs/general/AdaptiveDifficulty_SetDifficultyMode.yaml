  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: SetDifficultyMode
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::SetDifficultyMode(const std::string & mode)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the adaptive difficulty mode for the current instance or zone.
  description: The SetDifficultyMode method configures the adaptive difficulty setting
    for a specific game instance or zone. This function adjusts the challenge level
    of content dynamically based on player performance and group composition. The
    method typically updates internal difficulty tracking variables and may trigger
    recalculations of mob levels, loot drops, and experience rewards. It is commonly
    used in custom scripts or modules that modify the default difficulty behavior
    of World of Warcraft content.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: A string representing the desired difficulty mode. Valid values are
      typically 'normal', 'heroic', 'mythic', or other game-specific difficulty identifiers.
      The exact supported modes depend on the TrinityCore version and custom configurations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Heroic Difficulty Mode
    code: AdaptiveDifficulty::SetDifficultyMode("heroic");
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Difficulty Mode Switching
    code: "void ChangeToMythicMode() {\n    AdaptiveDifficulty::SetDifficultyMode(\"\
      mythic\");\n    // Additional logic to update world state or notify players\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal game state variables and may require
    synchronization across multiple threads in a multiplayer environment. Ensure that
    difficulty changes are properly communicated to all players in the instance.
  warnings: Changing difficulty modes during active combat or player encounters may
    cause unexpected behavior or client-side desynchronization. Always validate input
    parameters before calling this method.
