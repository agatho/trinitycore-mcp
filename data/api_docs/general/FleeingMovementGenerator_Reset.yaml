  class: FleeingMovementGenerator
  method: Reset
  signature: void FleeingMovementGenerator::Reset(int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the fleeing movement generator state for the specified owner.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the fleeing movement
    generator, preparing it to execute a flee behavior. This typically occurs when
    an AI-controlled creature begins or restarts a fleeing action due to being threatened
    or damaged. The method ensures that internal state variables are properly reset
    and that the movement generator is ready to calculate and follow a flee path away
    from its target. It may also handle cleanup of previous flee-related data and
    prepare for new flee calculations based on current conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the unit (creature or player) that owns this movement
      generator. This parameter is used to access the owner's state, position, and
      target information during the flee calculation process.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'FleeingMovementGenerator fleeingGen;

      Unit* owner = ...; // Some unit with flee behavior

      fleeingGen.Reset(&owner);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset During Flee Activation
    code: "void OnThreatened(Unit* attacker)\n{\n    if (m_fleeingGenerator)\n   \
      \ {\n        m_fleeingGenerator->Reset(&m_owner);\n        m_owner->AddUnitState(UNIT_STATE_FLEEING);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a creature
    begins fleeing, and it's important that the owner parameter points to a valid
    unit object. The Reset operation may involve recalculating flee paths or updating
    internal timers related to the fleeing behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the owner pointer passed into this method is not null; otherwise,
    accessing the owner's properties will result in undefined behavior. This method
    should only be called when transitioning into a fleeing state to avoid inconsistent
    movement generator states.
