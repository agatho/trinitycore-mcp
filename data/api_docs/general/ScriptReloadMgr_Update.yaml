documentation:
  brief: Updates the script reload manager to process pending script reload operations.
  description: The Update method in ScriptReloadMgr is responsible for handling and
    executing pending script reload requests within the TrinityCore server. This method
    typically runs during the server's main loop and checks for any queued script
    reload commands, then processes them accordingly. It ensures that script changes
    are applied dynamically without requiring a full server restart. The method may
    also handle cleanup of old script instances and initialization of new ones as
    part of the reload process.

  - title: Basic Usage in Server Loop
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n    sScriptReloadMgr->Update();\n\
      \    // ... other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main server update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom reload logic. It's designed
    to be thread-safe as it operates within the main server thread context.
