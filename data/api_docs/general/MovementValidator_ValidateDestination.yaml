  class: MovementValidator
  method: ValidateDestination
  signature: bool MovementValidator::ValidateDestination(Player * bot, const int &
    destination) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a given destination is accessible and safe for a bot player
    to move to.
  description: The ValidateDestination method checks whether a specified destination
    coordinate is valid and safe for a bot player to navigate towards. It evaluates
    factors such as terrain accessibility, collision detection, and game world boundaries
    to ensure the movement path is feasible. This validation is crucial in automated
    AI behavior to prevent bots from attempting invalid moves that could lead to stuck
    states or client-side errors. The method typically integrates with the TrinityCore
    movement system to verify destination coordinates against current map data and
    navigation meshes.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will be moving to the destination.
  - name: destination
    description: Integer reference representing the destination identifier or coordinate
      value used for validation. This could be a waypoint index, map ID, or other
      internal representation depending on implementation context.
  returns: Returns true if the destination is valid and accessible for the bot to
    move towards; otherwise returns false if the destination is invalid, blocked,
    or unsafe.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destination Validation
    code: "Player* myBot = ...;\nint destId = 12345;\nbool isValid = MovementValidator::ValidateDestination(myBot,\
      \ destId);\nif (isValid) {\n    // Proceed with movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Movement Logic
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    void MoveToDestination(Player* bot, int destinationId)\
      \ {\n        if (MovementValidator::ValidateDestination(bot, destinationId))\
      \ {\n            // Initiate movement to destination\n            bot->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(destinationId,\
      \ x, y, z);\n        } else {\n            // Handle invalid destination\n \
      \           bot->Say(\"Cannot reach destination.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the current map's navigation mesh
    and collision data. It may cache previous validation results for performance optimization.
    The exact implementation details depend on how destination IDs are interpreted
    within the TrinityCore movement system.
  warnings: Ensure that the destination parameter is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as invalid or uninitialized values can lead to undefined behavior.
    This method should not be called from within a movement update loop without proper
    throttling to avoid performance degradation.
