  class: AVStrategy
  method: AVStrategy
  signature: void AVStrategy::AVStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AVStrategy class for use in Alterac Valley
    battleground AI.
  description: The AVStrategy constructor initializes the necessary internal state
    and data structures required for handling AI behavior specific to the Alterac
    Valley battleground. This method sets up default values for strategy parameters,
    initializes internal flags, and prepares the AI system to respond to various battlefield
    events such as capture point control, player interactions, and objective completion.
    The initialization process ensures that the strategy object is in a valid state
    before being used by the battleground's AI subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AVStrategy instance
    code: 'AVStrategy* strategy = new AVStrategy();

      // The strategy object is now initialized and ready for use in Alterac Valley
      AI logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during the initialization phase of
    a battleground or when creating new AI instances. The object must be properly
    managed with memory allocation/deallocation to prevent memory leaks. The strategy
    relies on global Alterac Valley configuration data, so it should not be instantiated
    before the battleground system is fully initialized.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you are implementing a custom
    AI handler for Alterac Valley. Improper instantiation may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes due to missing global context data. The object must be destroyed properly
    using the destructor to avoid resource leaks.
