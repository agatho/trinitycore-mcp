documentation:
  brief: Applies the Cenarion Ward spell effect to the target group
  description: The HandleCenarionWard method implements the functionality of the Cenarion
    Ward ability for Restoration Druids. This spell creates a protective ward around
    the targeted group members that absorbs damage and reduces magic damage taken.
    The method handles the application of the ward's effects, including damage absorption
    calculations and duration management. It ensures that only valid group members
    receive the ward effect and properly manages the spell's cooldown and resource
    costs. The method returns true if the ward was successfully applied to the group,
    or false if the conditions for casting were not met.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group members should receive
      the Cenarion Ward effect. This parameter determines the scope of the spell application
      and can represent different group types such as player party, raid group, or
      custom group configurations.
  returns: Returns true if the Cenarion Ward was successfully applied to all valid
    group members, or false if the spell failed to cast due to invalid parameters,
    insufficient resources, or other preconditions not being met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Cenarion Ward on player group
    code: "if (druid->HandleCenarionWard(PLAYER_GROUP)) {\n    // Ward successfully\
      \ applied\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Cenarion Ward activated!\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to apply ward\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Failed to activate Cenarion\
      \ Ward.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Cenarion Ward with raid group
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup && raidGroup->isRaidGroup())\
      \ {\n    int raidId = raidGroup->GetId();\n    if (druid->HandleCenarionWard(raidId))\
      \ {\n        // Apply ward to entire raid\n        SendSystemMessage(\"Cenarion\
      \ Ward applied to the entire raid!\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Restoration Druid's core healing toolkit and requires
    proper resource management. The ward effect typically reduces incoming magic damage
    by a percentage or fixed amount, depending on the spell level and druid's stats.
    Implementation should consider group validation to ensure only valid targets receive
    the effect.
  warnings: The method may fail if the target group is invalid or if the druid lacks
    sufficient mana or other required resources. Ensure that group members are within
    appropriate range before calling this method, as it may not work correctly with
    disconnected or out-of-range players.
