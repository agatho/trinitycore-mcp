  class: IBotSpawner
  method: DespawnBot
  signature: void IBotSpawner::DespawnBot(int guid, bool forced)
documentation:
  brief: Despawns a bot with the specified GUID from the game world, optionally forcing
    its removal.
  description: The DespawnBot method removes a bot character from the game world based
    on its unique identifier (GUID). This function is typically used in automated
    bot management systems within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. The
    method allows for both normal despawning and forced removal, which may bypass
    certain checks or delays. When forced is set to true, the bot is immediately removed
    without waiting for any cleanup routines or event handlers. The method does not
    return any value but affects the internal state of the bot spawner system.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be despawned. This is
      typically a 32-bit integer representing the bot's entity ID in the game world.
  - name: forced
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the bot should be despawned forcefully.
      If true, the bot is removed immediately without normal cleanup procedures. If
      false, the bot is despawned according to standard protocols.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Despawn Usage
    code: 'IBotSpawner* spawner = GetBotSpawner();

      spawner->DespawnBot(12345, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Despawn for Immediate Removal
    code: 'IBotSpawner* spawner = GetBotSpawner();

      spawner->DespawnBot(67890, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of TrinityCore's bot management system.
    The GUID parameter must correspond to an existing bot entity; otherwise, the behavior
    is undefined. When forced is enabled, the method may skip important cleanup steps
    such as releasing resources or notifying other systems about the bot's departure.
  warnings: Using forced despawning (forced = true) can lead to resource leaks or
    inconsistent state if other systems are relying on the bot being properly cleaned
    up. Always ensure that all references to the bot are cleared before calling this
    method with forced=true.
