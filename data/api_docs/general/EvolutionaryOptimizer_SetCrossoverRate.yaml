  class: EvolutionaryOptimizer
  method: SetCrossoverRate
  signature: void EvolutionaryOptimizer::SetCrossoverRate(float rate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the crossover rate for the evolutionary optimization algorithm.
  description: The SetCrossoverRate method configures the probability that two individuals
    will exchange genetic material during the reproduction phase of the evolutionary
    optimizer. This parameter directly influences how frequently offspring are generated
    through combination of parent solutions, affecting the exploration vs. exploitation
    balance in the optimization process. The crossover rate is typically expressed
    as a float between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 means no crossover occurs and 1.0 means
    all offspring are created via crossover. This method is essential for tuning the
    behavior of evolutionary algorithms within TrinityCore's AI systems or genetic
    algorithm implementations.
  parameters:
  - name: rate
    description: The crossover rate as a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0.
      A value of 0.0 disables crossover, while 1.0 enables crossover for all offspring
      generation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Crossover Rate to 0.8
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetCrossoverRate(0.8f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Crossover
    code: 'EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetCrossoverRate(0.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects the evolutionary algorithm's performance and convergence
    characteristics. It should be called before starting optimization runs to ensure
    consistent behavior. The implementation may validate input values to ensure they
    fall within [0.0, 1.0] range.
