documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the number of spells available for training by a creature
    trainer.
  description: The EvaluateTrainerSpells method determines how many spells a specific
    creature trainer has available for teaching to players. This function is typically
    used during NPC interaction processing to assess the trainer's spell catalog and
    may be involved in determining whether a player can learn new spells or if the
    trainer's menu should display options. The method likely iterates through the
    trainer's spell list, filtering out invalid or unlearnable entries based on game
    rules and player progression. It returns an integer representing the count of
    valid trainable spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of spells that are available for
    training by the specified creature trainer. A return value of zero means no spells
    are currently trainable, while a positive integer indicates the total count of
    learnable spells.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Interaction
    code: "int spellCount = interactionManager.EvaluateTrainerSpells(trainerCreature);\n\
      if (spellCount > 0)\n{\n    // Display trainer's spell options to player\n \
      \   player->SendTrainerList(trainerCreature);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No spells\
      \ available for training\n    player->SendNoTrainerDialog();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the core NPC interaction logic and may be called
    frequently during trainer interactions. It's important to note that the actual
    spell learning mechanics are handled separately by other systems, and this method
    only evaluates availability for display purposes.
