  brief: Returns the team ID of the player in battlegrounds.
  description: This method retrieves the team ID assigned to the player during battleground
    matches. The returned value corresponds to either 0 or 1, representing Alliance
    and Horde teams respectively. It is commonly used in battleground-related logic
    to determine which faction a player belongs to. This method does not require any
    parameters and returns an integer value indicating the team assignment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value of 0 or 1, where 0 represents the Alliance team
    and 1 represents the Horde team. The value is determined by the player's faction
    during battleground matchmaking.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int team = player->GetBGTeam();\nif (team == 0)\n{\n    // Player is on\
      \ Alliance team\n}\nelse if (team == 1)\n{\n    // Player is on Horde team\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used in battleground contexts only, as it may return
    incorrect values outside of battlegrounds. The value returned is consistent with
    the player's faction assignment during battleground match-making.
  warnings: This method should not be used for general player identification outside
    of battleground contexts, as it may return incorrect values or cause unexpected
    behavior.
