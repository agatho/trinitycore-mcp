documentation:
  brief: Destroys a WeatherScript instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The WeatherScript destructor is automatically invoked when a WeatherScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the weather script
    instance. In TrinityCore's context, this typically occurs during server shutdown,
    map loading/unloading, or when weather systems are removed from game objects.
    The destructor does not take any parameters and performs no special operations
    beyond standard object cleanup.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of WeatherScript instance
    code: 'WeatherScript* script = new WeatherScript();

      // ... use the script ...

      delte script; // Destructor called here automatically'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, allowing proper cleanup
    of derived weather script classes. Developers should not manually invoke this
    destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns.
