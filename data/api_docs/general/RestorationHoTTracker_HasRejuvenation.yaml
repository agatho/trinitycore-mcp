documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has an active Rejuvenation spell effect.
  description: The HasRejuvenation method determines whether a specific player, identified
    by their GUID, currently has an active Rejuvenation spell effect applied to them.
    This method is typically used in healing spell logic to verify if a target is
    already benefiting from the Rejuvenation HoT (Heal over Time) effect before applying
    additional healing or refreshing the duration. The method performs a lookup within
    the internal tracking system of active HoTs for the specified player and returns
    true if a Rejuvenation effect is found, otherwise false. This functionality is
    crucial in maintaining proper spell interaction mechanics and preventing duplicate
    or overlapping effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player with the specified GUID currently has an active
    Rejuvenation spell effect; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Player Rejuvenation Status
    code: "if (restorationHoTTracker->HasRejuvenation(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player\
      \ already has Rejuvenation active\n    // Handle logic for not applying another\
      \ instance\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Healing Spell Logic
    code: "void ApplyHealingSpell(Unit* target, uint32 spellId) {\n    if (spellId\
      \ == SPELL_REJUVENATION && restorationHoTTracker->HasRejuvenation(target->GetGUID().GetCounter()))\
      \ {\n        // Rejuvenation already active, refresh duration instead\n    \
      \    RefreshRejuvenation(target);\n    } else {\n        // Apply new Rejuvenation\
      \ effect\n        ApplyNewRejuvenation(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of active HoT effects and assumes
    that the GUID parameter corresponds to a valid player unit. The implementation
    likely uses a map or similar data structure for O(1) lookup performance. It's
    important to note that this check is typically performed during spell application
    or refresh logic, not during regular game tick processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method correctly identifies a player
    unit; passing an invalid or non-player GUID may lead to undefined behavior or
    incorrect results. This method should not be used as a general-purpose status
    checker without considering the specific context of healing spell mechanics in
    TrinityCore.
