documentation:
  brief: Initializes the loot strategy actions for a creature or game object.
  description: The InitializeActions method sets up and configures the loot strategy
    behavior for a creature or game object within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method is typically called during the initialization phase of a lootable entity
    to establish the rules and conditions that govern how items are distributed among
    players who participate in the loot roll. It prepares internal data structures
    and registers necessary callbacks or event handlers required for proper loot distribution
    mechanics, ensuring that the loot strategy adheres to the defined parameters such
    as loot modes, group looting settings, and item quality thresholds.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'LootStrategy* strategy = new LootStrategy();

      strategy->InitializeActions();

      // Loot strategy is now ready for use with a creature or game object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the object's initialization
    lifecycle. Reinitialization may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks if
    not properly handled. The method does not directly interact with player data but
    prepares the internal state for future loot operations.
  warnings: Do not call InitializeActions after the loot strategy has already been
    used in a live loot scenario, as this can cause inconsistencies in loot distribution
    and potential crashes due to uninitialized or corrupted internal states.
