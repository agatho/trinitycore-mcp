  brief: Constructs a new ActionFactory instance as a copy of an existing ActionFactory
    object
  description: The ActionFactory constructor is a copy constructor that creates a
    new ActionFactory instance by copying the state and configuration from an existing
    ActionFactory object. This method is typically used when creating duplicate action
    factories for different contexts or when managing multiple instances of action
    handling logic within the TrinityCore framework. The copied instance maintains
    identical behavior and data to the source object, ensuring consistent action processing
    across various game systems that utilize action factories.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source ActionFactory object to be copied. This parameter represents
      an existing ActionFactory instance whose state will be duplicated in the newly
      constructed object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Copy of an ActionFactory
    code: 'ActionFactory originalFactory;

      // ... configure originalFactory ...

      ActionFactory copiedFactory(originalFactory); // Uses copy constructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Copy Constructor in AI Behavior System
    code: "class AIHandler {\npublic:\n    void SetupBehavior() {\n        ActionFactory\
      \ baseFactory;\n        // Configure baseFactory with default actions\n    \
      \    ActionFactory behaviorFactory(baseFactory); // Create copy for specific\
      \ NPC\n        // Use behaviorFactory for NPC-specific actions\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the ActionFactory's internal
    state. Any pointers or references within the ActionFactory should be properly
    managed to avoid dangling references. The implementation assumes that the source
    object is in a valid state and contains all necessary configuration data for proper
    operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the source ActionFactory object passed to this constructor
    is fully initialized and not in an invalid state, as copying from an uninitialized
    object may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect action handling logic. Be cautious
    when using this constructor with objects that contain dynamically allocated resources
    that require deep copying.
