  class: WhoListPlayerInfo
  method: GetRace
  signature: uint8 WhoListPlayerInfo::GetRace() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the race identifier of the player in the who list entry.
  description: The GetRace method returns the racial identifier of a player as stored
    in the WhoListPlayerInfo structure. This value corresponds to the internal race
    enumeration used by TrinityCore and represents the player's character race in
    a numeric format. The returned uint8 value can be used to determine which race
    a player belongs to, such as Human (1), Orc (2), Dwarf (3), etc. This method is
    typically used when processing or displaying information from the 'who' command
    results, allowing server-side code to filter or categorize players based on their
    race. The method does not perform any validation or transformation of the stored
    value; it simply retrieves and returns the raw race identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the player's race identifier according to TrinityCore's
    internal race enumeration system. Common values include 1 (Human), 2 (Orc), 3
    (Dwarf), 4 (Night Elf), 5 (Undead), 6 (Tauren), 7 (Gnome), 8 (Troll), 9 (Goblin),
    10 (Blood Elf), 11 (Draenei), 22 (Worgen), 24 (Pandaren), 25 (Nightborne), 26
    (Highmountain Tauren), 27 (Void Elf), 28 (Lightforged Draenei), 29 (Zandalari
    Troll), 30 (Kul Tiran), 31 (Dark Iron Dwarf), 32 (Vulpera), 33 (Mag'har Orc),
    34 (Mechagnome), 35 (Dracthyr).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Who List Processing
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// ... populate playerInfo ...\nuint8 race\
      \ = playerInfo.GetRace();\nif (race == 1) // Human\n{\n    // Handle human player\
      \ logic\n    std::cout << \"Player is Human\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering Players by Race in Who List
    code: "std::vector<WhoListPlayerInfo> whoList;\n// ... populate whoList ...\n\
      std::vector<WhoListPlayerInfo> humanPlayers;\nfor (const auto& player : whoList)\n\
      {\n    if (player.GetRace() == 1) // Human\n    {\n        humanPlayers.push_back(player);\n\
      \    }\n}\nstd::cout << \"Found \" << humanPlayers.size() << \" human players\"\
      \ << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: The race identifier returned by this method is directly from the player's
    stored data and should not be modified. The values correspond to the Race enum
    defined in TrinityCore's codebase, which may differ slightly from client-side
    representations. This method is thread-safe as it only reads immutable data from
    the structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the WhoListPlayerInfo object being queried is properly initialized
    before calling this method, otherwise the returned value will be undefined. Be
    aware that race values may change in future expansions or custom modifications
    to TrinityCore's race definitions.
