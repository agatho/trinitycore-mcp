  brief: Checks whether the player has level boosted
  description: This method determines if a player has undergone level boosting, which
    is a game mechanic that allows players to gain additional experience points beyond
    normal leveling limits. The method returns true when the player's level has been
    boosted through various in-game mechanisms such as quest completion or special
    events. This functionality is crucial for tracking player progression and ensuring
    proper gameplay balance within TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has level boosteded, false otherwise. The method
    does not distinguish between different types of level boosting but simply indicates
    whether the player's level has been modified through game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->HasLevelBoosted()) {\n    // Player has level boosted\n   \
      \ // Do something here\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details are not available but this method likely checks internal
    player state flags or attributes related to level modification. Performance considerations
    are minimal as it's a simple boolean check.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in conjunction with other level-related
    methods, as it may affect gameplay balance and progression tracking. Be aware
    that the method might not reflect all possible level boosting scenarios within
    TrinityCore.
