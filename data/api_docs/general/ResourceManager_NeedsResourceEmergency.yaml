  method: NeedsResourceEmergency
  signature: bool ResourceManager::NeedsResourceEmergency()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the resource manager requires emergency resource allocation.
  description: The NeedsResourceEmergency method evaluates the current state of the
    ResourceManager to determine if emergency resource allocation is required. This
    typically occurs when critical system resources are running low or when specific
    thresholds have been breached. The method checks internal resource levels, pending
    requests, and system constraints to make this determination. It is commonly used
    in game loop logic to trigger emergency resource handling routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ResourceManager determines that emergency resource
    allocation is needed; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (resourceManager.NeedsResourceEmergency()) {\n    // Handle emergency\
      \ resource allocation\n    resourceManager.AllocateEmergencyResources();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop() {\n    while (true) {\n        // ... other game logic\
      \ ...\n        if (resourceManager.NeedsResourceEmergency()) {\n           \
      \ resourceManager.ProcessEmergencyAllocation();\n        }\n        // ... rest\
      \ of game loop ...\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during critical system checks and may involve
    performance-sensitive operations. It should not be called excessively in tight
    loops without proper throttling mechanisms.
  warnings: Do not assume that calling this method will immediately resolve resource
    shortages. The method only indicates the need for action, it does not perform
    the actual allocation.
