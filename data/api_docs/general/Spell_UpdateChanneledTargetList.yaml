  class: Spell
  method: UpdateChanneledTargetList
  signature: bool Spell::UpdateChanneledTargetList()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the list of targets currently channeling the spell.
  description: This method updates the internal target list for spells that are currently
    being channeled, ensuring that the target list reflects the current state of channeling
    effects. It is used to maintain accurate tracking of which targets are affected
    by ongoing channeling spells, particularly important for maintaining proper game
    mechanics in World of Warcraft's spell system. The method typically operates during
    the spell's channeling period and updates target lists based on current target
    status and validity.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target list was successfully updated, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the update process completed correctly or encountered issues
    during execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->UpdateChanneledTargetList()) {\n    // Target list updated successfully\n\
      \    // Continue with channeling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell update cycles and should be
    invoked only when channeling spells are actively running. The implementation may
    involve checking target validity, updating target lists, and ensuring proper synchronization
    between the spell's channeling state and target list updates.
  warnings: This method should not be called outside of active channeling periods
    as it can lead to incorrect target tracking or inconsistent behavior. Also, improper
    handling of this method could cause performance issues if called too frequently
    during channeling.
