  method: IsActive
  signature: bool FingersOfFrostTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the Fingers of Frost buff is currently active on the player.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the Fingers of Frost talent buff
    is currently applied to the player. This buff typically provides increased spell
    damage or other benefits based on the number of frost spells cast. The method
    returns true when the buff is active and false otherwise. This check is commonly
    used in spell processing logic to determine if special effects should be triggered
    or modified based on the presence of this buff.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Fingers of Frost buff is currently active on the player,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "if (player->GetFingersOfFrostTracker()->IsActive()) {\n    // Apply enhanced\
      \ damage or effects\n    spell->SetDamage(spell->GetDamage() * 1.2f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Buff Status Before Casting
    code: "if (!player->GetFingersOfFrostTracker()->IsActive()) {\n    // Log or notify\
      \ that buff is not active\n    player->SendNotification(\"Fingers of Frost is\
      \ not active.\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed with normal spell casting logic\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FROSTBOLT, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal state variables within the FingersOfFrostTracker
    class that track the buff duration and application status. The implementation
    may involve checking for active aura effects or tracking spell cast counters.
