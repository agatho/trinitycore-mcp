  signature: void MechanicAwareness::RegisterAOEZone(const AOEZone & zone)
documentation:
  brief: Registers an Area of Effect (AOE) zone with the MechanicAwareness system
    for tracking and processing.
  description: The RegisterAOEZone method integrates a specified AOEZone object into
    the MechanicAwareness system, enabling the tracking and handling of area-based
    effects within the game world. This functionality is crucial for managing mechanics
    such as spell AoEs, environmental hazards, or other spatial effects that impact
    multiple targets. The method likely stores the zone data internally for later
    processing during game updates or event triggers. It's typically used by subsystems
    responsible for combat mechanics, environmental effects, or player interaction
    with spatial zones.
  parameters:
  - name: zone
    description: A constant reference to an AOEZone object that defines the area of
      effect to be registered. This object should contain information about the zone's
      position, radius, shape, and associated mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AOE Zone Registration
    code: 'AOEZone myZone;

      myZone.position = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      myZone.radius = 50.0f;

      myZone.type = AOEType::Fire;

      mechanicAwareness.RegisterAOEZone(myZone);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation of the zone data to ensure
    it's within acceptable bounds and properly formatted. The registration process
    may involve adding the zone to an internal spatial partitioning structure for
    efficient querying during updates.
  warnings: Attempting to register a malformed or invalid AOEZone may result in undefined
    behavior or system errors. Ensure that all required fields of the AOEZone object
    are properly initialized before calling this method.
