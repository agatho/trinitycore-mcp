documentation:
  brief: Logs an error message when a player fails to turn in a quest
  description: The LogTurnInError method records diagnostic information about quest
    turn-in failures for a given player and quest ID. This function is typically used
    within the TrinityCore framework to track issues such as missing items, incorrect
    quest status, or other validation errors that prevent a quest from being properly
    turned in. The error message is logged to the server's logging system for debugging
    and monitoring purposes. This method does not alter game state directly but serves
    as a diagnostic tool for quest-related problems.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player attempting to
      turn in the quest. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest being turned in. Should correspond
      to a valid quest in the database.
  - name: error
    description: String containing the error message describing why the quest turn-in
      failed. Should be descriptive and helpful for debugging.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Logging Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestTurnIn::LogTurnInError(player, questId, "Required item not found in inventory");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Error Logging with Dynamic Message
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      std::string errorMessage = "Quest failed due to missing prerequisite: " + GetQuestName(questId);

      QuestTurnIn::LogTurnInError(player, questId, errorMessage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore logging system and will output to the
    server console and log files. The player object must be valid and not null when
    passed to this function. It is recommended to use this method in conjunction with
    other quest validation checks before calling it.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer may cause undefined behavior. Also ensure that the questId
    corresponds to an actual quest in the database to maintain proper logging accuracy.
