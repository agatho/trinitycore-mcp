documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SpellScriptBase instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SpellScriptBase class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the spell script instance.
    In the context of TrinityCore's spell system, this method ensures proper deallocation
    of script data when a spell script object is no longer needed. It typically handles
    cleanup of internal state, references to game objects, and any temporary allocations
    that may have occurred during the spell's execution lifecycle. This destructor
    is automatically invoked when a SpellScriptBase object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of spell script
    code: "void SomeSpellHandler() {\n    SpellScriptBase* script = new SpellScriptBase();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor is automatically\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It's part of the standard C++ object lifecycle and is invoked automatically by
    the runtime when objects are destroyed. In TrinityCore, spell scripts are typically
    managed through smart pointers or the spell system's internal object pooling mechanisms.
