  notes: This method likely involves internal calculations of item bonuses and may
    require careful handling during character progression or when changing gear configurations.
    It is typically used in conjunction with other Azerite-related methods for full
    control over gear modifications.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause incorrect stat application or removal,
    potentially affecting player performance in combat. Care should be taken when
    applying or removing Azerite mods to avoid unintended consequences.
