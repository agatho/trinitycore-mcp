  class: EmblemInfo
  method: GetColor
  signature: uint32 EmblemInfo::GetColor() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the emblem color value associated with the EmblemInfo object.
  description: The GetColor method retrieves the color identifier that represents
    the emblem's visual color. This value is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    UI systems to display faction emblems or guild insignias with their correct colors.
    The returned uint32 value usually corresponds to a predefined color palette within
    the game's client resources. This method does not modify any internal state and
    is safe for repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the emblem's color. This value typically maps
    to a specific RGB color in the game's color system, used for rendering emblems
    in the UI.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EmblemInfo emblem;

      uint32 color = emblem.GetColor();

      // Use color value to set UI element properties'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Color in Guild Context
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    EmblemInfo emblem\
      \ = guild->GetEmblemInfo();\n    uint32 color = emblem.GetColor();\n    // Apply\
      \ color to guild emblem display\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is const and does not perform any expensive operations. It simply
    returns a cached or stored value from the EmblemInfo object. The actual meaning
    of the uint32 value depends on how it's interpreted by the client-side UI rendering
    system.
