  class: DPSPositioning
  method: SpreadRangedPositions
  signature: void DPSPositioning::SpreadRangedPositions(const int & rangedDPS, Unit
    * target, float spreadDistance)
documentation:
  brief: Positions ranged DPS units around a target within a specified spread distance.
  description: The SpreadRangedPositions method calculates and applies optimal positioning
    for ranged Damage Per Second (DPS) units around a given target. It ensures that
    these units are distributed at a defined distance from the target to maximize
    damage output while maintaining tactical spacing. This method is typically used
    in AI behavior scripting or combat positioning systems within TrinityCore's framework.
    The method modifies the positions of the specified units directly, adjusting their
    locations based on the spread distance and target orientation.
  parameters:
  - name: rangedDPS
    description: A reference to an integer representing the number of ranged DPS units
      that need to be positioned around the target. This value determines how many
      positions will be calculated and applied.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to a Unit object which serves as the central point for
      positioning. All ranged DPS units will be spread around this target unit.
  - name: spreadDistance
    description: A float value indicating the maximum distance from the target that
      ranged DPS units should be positioned. This determines how far apart the units
      are distributed in a radial pattern.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DPSPositioning positioning;

      Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      int rangedDPSCount = 3;

      float spread = 10.0f;

      positioning.SpreadRangedPositions(rangedDPSCount, target, spread);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Spread
    code: 'DPSPositioning positioning;

      Unit* target = boss->GetVictim();

      int rangedDPSCount = 5;

      float spread = target->GetDistance(player) * 0.7f; // Dynamic spread based on
      distance

      positioning.SpreadRangedPositions(rangedDPSCount, target, spread);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target unit is valid and exists in the world.
    It may perform calculations involving angles and distances to determine optimal
    positioning. The actual movement of units is handled internally by the TrinityCore
    AI system after calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'rangedDPS' parameter represents a valid number of units,
    as negative or zero values could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be cautious
    when using dynamic spread distances that might result in overlapping or impossible
    positioning scenarios.
