documentation:
  brief: Reduces the charge count of a Precise Shots ability by one.
  description: The ConsumeCharge method is responsible for decrementing the internal
    charge counter associated with the Precise Shots talent. This mechanism is typically
    used in conjunction with abilities that have limited uses per combat encounter
    or time period. The method likely updates the tracker's state to reflect that
    one use has been consumed, potentially triggering cooldowns or other related mechanics.
    It is generally called when a player activates the Precise Shots ability or when
    a charge is otherwise expended during gameplay.

  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system managing player talents and
    their usage limits. It may be called automatically by the game engine when an
    ability is used, or manually by custom scripts or modules.
