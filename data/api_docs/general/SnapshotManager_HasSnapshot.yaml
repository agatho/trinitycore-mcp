  method: HasSnapshot
  signature: bool SnapshotManager::HasSnapshot(uint32 spellId, int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a snapshot exists for the specified spell and target.
  description: The HasSnapshot method determines whether a snapshot entry exists for
    a given spell ID and target. Snapshots are typically used in World of Warcraft's
    combat system to store temporary state information about spells, such as damage
    values or effects that persist across multiple ticks or events. This method is
    commonly used by the SnapshotManager class to validate whether certain spell data
    has been previously recorded or cached. The method does not modify any existing
    data but only performs a lookup operation based on the provided parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to check for an existing
      snapshot. This value must correspond to a valid spell in the game's database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier. If null,
      the method will check for snapshots associated with any target. If non-null,
      it checks specifically for snapshots matching the given target ID.
  returns: Returns true if a snapshot exists for the specified spell and target combination;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for a specific spell snapshot
    code: "if (snapshotManager.HasSnapshot(12345, nullptr)) {\n    // A snapshot exists\
      \ for spell ID 12345 regardless of target\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for a specific spell-target combination
    code: "int targetId = 67890;\nif (snapshotManager.HasSnapshot(12345, &targetId))\
      \ {\n    // A snapshot exists specifically for spell ID 12345 and target ID\
      \ 67890\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in an internal data structure managed by SnapshotManager.
    It is optimized for fast access but may have performance implications if called
    excessively in tight loops without proper caching.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to a valid spell in the
    game's database, as invalid IDs could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results. The target pointer should be valid when non-null to prevent memory access
    violations.
