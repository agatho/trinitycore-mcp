documentation:
  brief: Checks if the aura's area target requirements are met for the specified unit.
  description: The CheckAreaTarget method evaluates whether a given unit satisfies
    the conditions required for an aura to be applied or maintained in an area. This
    method is typically used during aura application and update cycles to determine
    if a target remains within the valid area of effect for the aura. It considers
    factors such as target type, faction, hostility, and other aura-specific restrictions.
    The method returns true if the target meets all area requirements, otherwise false.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified unit meets all area target requirements for
    the aura; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Target Check
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura && aura->CheckAreaTarget(targetUnit))\n\
      {\n    // Apply additional effects or update aura\n    aura->UpdateAuraDuration();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called during aura application and update events.
    It's important to note that this check does not validate the aura's own state,
    but only whether the target meets the area requirements defined by the aura's
    properties.
