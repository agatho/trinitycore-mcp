  brief: Learnes a garrison building from the spell's effect.
  description: This method handles the learning of garrison buildings through spell
    effects, allowing players to unlock and construct buildings within their garrison.
    It typically involves checking prerequisites such as level requirements, resource
    costs, and existing building unlocks before enabling the construction of new structures.
    The method is part of the broader spell system that governs player progression
    and garrison mechanics in World of Warcraft.

    code: "void Spell::EffectLearnGarrisonBuilding()\n{\n    // Implementation would\
      \ handle building learning logic\n    // This method is called when a spell\
      \ effect is applied\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal checks for garrison prerequisites and
    may require additional handling of player state or resource management. The implementation
    should be carefully reviewed to ensure proper integration with garrison systems.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method could lead to incorrect building unlocks
    or game progression issues. Ensure that all prerequisites are properly validated
    before enabling the building construction.
