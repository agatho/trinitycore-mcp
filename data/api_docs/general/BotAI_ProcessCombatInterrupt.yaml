  class: BotAI
  method: ProcessCombatInterrupt
  signature: void BotAI::ProcessCombatInterrupt(const CombatEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Processes combat interrupts for bot AI, handling events that disrupt normal
    combat flow.
  description: The ProcessCombatInterrupt method in the BotAI class is responsible
    for managing and responding to combat-related interrupt events that occur during
    bot gameplay. This method evaluates incoming CombatEvent objects to determine
    appropriate AI responses such as adjusting target selection, modifying spell casting
    behavior, or changing tactical positioning. It plays a crucial role in maintaining
    realistic bot combat behavior by reacting to interruptions like enemy abilities,
    environmental effects, or player actions that disrupt the bot's current combat
    state. The method ensures that bots can dynamically adapt their strategies when
    unexpected events occur during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A constant reference to a CombatEvent object containing details about
      the interrupt event that occurred, including event type, affected units, and
      timing information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnCombatEvent(const CombatEvent& event)\n{\n    ProcessCombatInterrupt(event);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Multiple Interrupt Types
    code: "void BotAI::ProcessCombatInterrupt(const CombatEvent& event)\n{\n    switch\
      \ (event.GetType())\n    {\n        case COMBAT_EVENT_INTERRUPT_CAST:\n    \
      \        // Handle interrupted spell casting\n            break;\n        case\
      \ COMBAT_EVENT_INTERRUPT_TARGET:\n            // Handle target switching due\
      \ to interrupt\n            break;\n        default:\n            // Default\
      \ handling for other interrupts\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when combat events
    are detected. Developers should ensure that event data passed to this method is
    valid and properly initialized to avoid unexpected behavior. The implementation
    may involve state transitions and tactical recalculations that could impact performance
    during high-frequency combat events.
  warnings: Improper handling of interrupt events can lead to bots becoming unresponsive
    or behaving erratically in combat situations. Care should be taken when modifying
    the default interrupt handling logic as it directly affects bot AI realism and
    gameplay balance.
