  method: ShouldUseDefensiveCooldowns
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ShouldUseDefensiveCooldowns() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether defensive cooldowns should be used based on current combat
    state and AI behavior.
  description: The ShouldUseDefensiveCooldowns method evaluates the current combat
    situation and AI decision-making logic to determine if it is appropriate to activate
    defensive cooldowns for the unit. This method considers factors such as health
    percentage, incoming damage threat, target proximity, and overall tactical positioning.
    It is typically used within the adaptive AI behavior system to dynamically adjust
    when defensive abilities should be triggered during encounters. The result of
    this method directly influences the decision-making process for cooldown usage
    in the AdaptiveBehaviorManager's combat logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if defensive cooldowns should currently be used based on the
    AI's evaluation of the combat state; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Decision
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.ShouldUseDefensiveCooldowns()) {\n    unit->CastSpell(target,\
      \ DEFENSIVE_COOLDOWN_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Health-Based Logic
    code: "if (unit->GetHealthPct() < 30.0f && adaptiveBehaviorManager.ShouldUseDefensiveCooldowns())\
      \ {\n    unit->CastSpell(unit, HEALTH_POTION_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive AI system and relies on real-time combat
    data to make decisions. It may be called frequently during combat, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account when implementing custom behavior
    logic.
