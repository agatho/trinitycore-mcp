  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: SetGroupObjective
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::SetGroupObjective(uint32 groupId, const GroupObjective
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the objective for a specified group in the playerbot system.
  description: The SetGroupObjective method assigns a specific GroupObjective to a
    given group within the TrinityCore playerbot framework. This allows bot groups
    to have defined goals such as looting, questing, or combat strategies. The method
    updates the internal state of the group's objective without requiring a full group
    reinitialization. It is typically used by the playerbot AI system to dynamically
    adjust group behavior based on game conditions or player input.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the group for which to set the objective. Must
      correspond to an existing group in the playerbot system.
  - name: objective
    description: The GroupObjective structure defining the target behavior or goal
      for the specified group. This includes details like quest ID, loot strategy,
      or combat role.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Quest Objective for a Group
    code: 'GroupObjective questObj;

      questObj.type = GROUP_OBJECTIVE_QUEST;

      questObj.questId = 12345;

      playerbotGroupManager->SetGroupObjective(1, questObj);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning a Loot Objective to a Group
    code: 'GroupObjective lootObj;

      lootObj.type = GROUP_OBJECTIVE_LOOT;

      lootObj.lootStrategy = LOOT_STRATEGY_MASTER_LOOT;

      playerbotGroupManager->SetGroupObjective(2, lootObj);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the playerbot AI subsystem and modifies group
    behavior dynamically. It assumes that the groupId corresponds to a valid existing
    group managed by the PlayerbotGroupManager. The GroupObjective parameter should
    be properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid groupId may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the GroupObjective is correctly configured and that the
    group exists before attempting to set its objective.
