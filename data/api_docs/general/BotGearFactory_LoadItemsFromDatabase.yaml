api:
  class: BotGearFactory
  method: LoadItemsFromDatabase
  signature: void BotGearFactory::LoadItemsFromDatabase()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all bot gear items from the database into memory for use in bot equipment
    management.
  description: The LoadItemsFromDatabase method retrieves all relevant item data from
    the TrinityCore database and populates internal data structures used by the BotGearFactory.
    This method is typically invoked during bot initialization or when the gear factory
    needs to refresh its item inventory. It ensures that bots have access to up-to-date
    item information including stats, quality, and equip requirements. The method
    performs database queries to fetch item templates and related properties necessary
    for generating appropriate gear for different bot classes and levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotGearFactory factory;

      factory.LoadItemsFromDatabase();

      // Items are now loaded and ready to be used for bot gear generation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during initialization or when a complete
    refresh of the item database is required. It may cause performance overhead on
    large databases as it loads all items into memory. The method assumes that the
    database connection is already established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper caching mechanisms can lead
    to unnecessary database load and performance degradation. Ensure that the database
    is properly configured and accessible before invoking this method.
