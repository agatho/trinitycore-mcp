  method: DestroyOutdoorPvPForMap
  signature: void OutdoorPvPMgr::DestroyOutdoorPvPForMap(Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Destroys all Outdoor PvP objects associated with the specified map.
  description: The DestroyOutdoorPvPForMap method removes and cleans up all Outdoor
    PvP systems that are registered for a given map. This function is typically invoked
    when a map is being unloaded or destroyed, ensuring that no dangling references
    or memory leaks occur from Outdoor PvP components. It iterates through the registered
    OutdoorPvP instances for the specified map and properly disposes of them. The
    method ensures that any ongoing Outdoor PvP activities are terminated gracefully
    before cleanup occurs.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object for which all Outdoor PvP systems should
      be destroyed. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Destroy Outdoor PvP for a specific map during map unload
    code: "void UnloadMap(Map* map)\n{\n    // Perform map unload operations\n   \
      \ sOutdoorPvPMgr->DestroyOutdoorPvPForMap(map);\n    // Continue with other\
      \ cleanup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Map pointer is valid and has been properly
    initialized. It's typically called internally by the core map management system
    when a map instance is being destroyed or unloaded.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null map pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the map parameter is always validated before
    calling this function.
