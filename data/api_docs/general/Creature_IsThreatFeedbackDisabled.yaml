  method: IsThreatFeedbackDisabled
  signature: bool Creature::IsThreatFeedbackDisabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether threat feedback is disabled for the creature.
  description: This method checks if the creature has disabled threat feedback, which
    means the creature will not generate threat (aggro) when attacking players or
    other units. This is commonly used in special NPC behaviors where the creature
    should not engage in combat or should be immune to aggro from certain sources.
    The method returns true when threat feedback is disabled, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if threat feedback is disabled for the creature, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the creature will not generate threat when attacking targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsThreatFeedbackDisabled())\n{\n    // Creature will not\
      \ generate threat\n    // This could be used to prevent aggro in special scenarios\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with creature AI behavior settings.
    It's important to note that disabling threat feedback does not mean the creature
    is immune to all forms of damage or attack, but rather that it will not generate
    threat for the purposes of targeting and aggro.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as disabling threat feedback can
    affect combat mechanics and may lead to unexpected behavior in certain situations.
    It's recommended to verify the intended use case before implementing this functionality.
