  class: SceneObject
  method: GetFaction
  signature: int SceneObject::GetFaction() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the faction ID associated with the scene object.
  description: The GetFaction method returns the faction identifier that is assigned
    to the SceneObject. This faction ID determines the object's relationship with
    other game entities, such as whether it is hostile, friendly, or neutral. In World
    of Warcraft context, factions control interactions like combat, quest availability,
    and NPC dialogue options. The returned value corresponds to predefined faction
    templates within the game's database. This method does not modify any state and
    is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the faction ID of the scene object. A value of
    0 typically indicates a neutral or default faction, while other values correspond
    to specific faction entries defined in the game's faction database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SceneObject* obj = ...;\nint factionId = obj->GetFaction();\nif (factionId\
      \ == 14)\n{\n    // Object belongs to the Alliance faction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Faction for Interaction Logic
    code: "SceneObject* target = ...;\nint targetFaction = target->GetFaction();\n\
      if (targetFaction != player->GetFaction())\n{\n    // Perform hostile interaction\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const and safe to call from any thread context. The faction
    ID returned may be inherited from the object's template or set dynamically during
    runtime, depending on how the SceneObject was initialized.
  warnings: Be cautious when comparing faction IDs directly without verifying their
    validity against the game's faction database, as invalid IDs might lead to unexpected
    behavior in faction-based systems.
