  class: TerrainInfo
  method: LoadVMap
  signature: void TerrainInfo::LoadVMap(int32 gx, int32 gy)
documentation:
  brief: Loads the VMap data for a specific grid location in the terrain.
  description: The LoadVMap method is responsible for loading the Visual Map (VMap)
    data for a given grid position specified by grid coordinates gx and gy. This functionality
    is essential for handling terrain collision detection, line-of-sight calculations,
    and visual rendering in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment. The method
    ensures that all relevant VMap data structures are initialized and ready for use
    when performing spatial queries or rendering operations on the specified grid.
    It typically operates as part of the terrain management system and may be invoked
    automatically during world loading or when players move into new grid areas.
  parameters:
  - name: gx
    description: The X coordinate of the grid position to load VMap data for. This
      represents the horizontal grid index in the game world.
  - name: gy
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid position to load VMap data for. This
      represents the vertical grid index in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "TerrainInfo* terrain = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainInfo(0, 0);\nif (terrain)\n\
      {\n    terrain->LoadVMap(10, 15);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Checking
    code: "uint32 mapId = 0;\nint32 gridX = 10;\nint32 gridY = 15;\nTerrainInfo* terrain\
      \ = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainInfo(mapId, gridX, gridY);\nif (terrain)\n{\n   \
      \ terrain->LoadVMap(gridX, gridY);\n    // VMap data is now loaded for the specified\
      \ grid\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before performing any spatial queries on the
    specified grid. The loading process may block execution until the VMap data is
    fully loaded, so it's recommended to call this during initialization or when transitioning
    between zones rather than during active gameplay. The method assumes that the
    grid coordinates are valid and within the bounds of the current map.
  warnings: Calling LoadVMap with invalid grid coordinates may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the grid coordinates are within valid range for the current
    map. This method does not perform any automatic unloading of previously loaded
    VMap data, so calling it multiple times on the same grid may result in redundant
    operations.
