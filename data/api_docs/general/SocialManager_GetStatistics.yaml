documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the social statistics of the player
  description: The GetStatistics method retrieves the current social interaction statistics
    for the player, including data such as friend counts, ignored player counts, and
    other social-related metrics. This method provides read-only access to the internal
    statistics structure that tracks various aspects of a player's social behavior
    within the game world. The returned Statistics object is immutable and should
    not be modified directly. This method is typically used by the social system or
    UI components to display player social information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Statistics object containing current social
    interaction data for the player
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Social Statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = player->GetSocial()->GetStatistics();

      uint32 friendCount = stats.FriendsCount;

      uint32 ignoreCount = stats.IgnoredCount;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is a snapshot of the current state and may
    not reflect real-time changes. The method performs no locking operations internally,
    so concurrent access from multiple threads should be handled by the caller if
    necessary.
