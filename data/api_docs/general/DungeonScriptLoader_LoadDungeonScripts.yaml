documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all dungeon-specific script handlers for the TrinityCore
    instance.
  description: The LoadDungeonScripts method is responsible for initializing and registering
    all dungeon-related scripts within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    iterates through available dungeon definitions, loads their associated script
    files or configurations, and prepares them for execution when players enter specific
    dungeon instances. It ensures that custom behaviors, quest triggers, NPC interactions,
    and other dungeon-specific mechanics are properly set up before any player encounters
    occur. The method is usually invoked during server startup or dungeon initialization
    phases to ensure all scripted elements are ready for runtime use.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeDungeonScripts()\n{\n    DungeonScriptLoader\
      \ loader;\n    loader.LoadDungeonScripts();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server bootstrapping and should only
    be invoked once during the application lifecycle. It may involve file I/O operations
    to load script configurations, so performance considerations should be taken into
    account during high-traffic server startup phases.
