  class: SocialManager
  method: SocialManager
  signature: void SocialManager::SocialManager(Player * bot, BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a SocialManager instance with a player and AI context for managing
    social behaviors.
  description: The SocialManager constructor initializes a social behavior management
    system for a bot player within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up
    internal state to handle social interactions such as friend requests, ignore lists,
    and communication with other players. It takes a Player pointer representing the
    bot character and a BotAI pointer providing the artificial intelligence context
    for decision-making. The initialization process likely configures internal data
    structures and registers necessary callbacks for social events. This constructor
    is typically called during bot creation or when a bot needs to engage in social
    activities within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will use social behaviors
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object providing artificial intelligence context
      for social decision making
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SocialManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* botPlayer = ...; // Get bot player instance

      BotAI* botAI = ...; // Get bot AI instance

      SocialManager socialManager(botPlayer, botAI); // Initialize social manager'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs initialization of internal social data structures
    and may register event handlers for social-related game events. The SocialManager
    is expected to be used in conjunction with the bot's AI system to make decisions
    about social interactions.
  warnings: Ensure that both the Player and BotAI pointers are valid before calling
    this constructor, as invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    during social interaction handling.
