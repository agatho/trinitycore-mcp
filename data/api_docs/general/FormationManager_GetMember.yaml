  class: FormationManager
  method: GetMember
  signature: FormationMember * FormationManager::GetMember(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the formation member data associated with a specified player.
  description: The GetMember method retrieves the FormationMember object that corresponds
    to a given Player instance. This method is typically used within the context of
    group formations or player formations in World of Warcraft, where players are
    organized into structured groups for quests, raids, or other gameplay activities.
    The returned FormationMember contains information about the player's role, position,
    and status within the formation. If no formation member exists for the specified
    player, the method may return a null pointer or throw an exception depending on
    implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the FormationMember associated with the given Player. Returns
    nullptr if no formation member is found for the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nFormationMember*\
      \ member = formationManager->GetMember(player);\nif (member != nullptr) {\n\
      \    // Use the formation member data\n    uint32 roleId = member->GetRoleId();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FormationManager has been properly initialized
    and maintains a mapping between Player objects and their corresponding FormationMember
    entries. It is recommended to verify that the player object is valid before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null Player pointer may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate input parameters before invoking the method.
