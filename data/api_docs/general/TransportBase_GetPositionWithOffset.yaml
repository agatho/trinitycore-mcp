  class: TransportBase
  method: GetPositionWithOffset
  signature: int TransportBase::GetPositionWithOffset(const int & offset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the position offset value from the transport base.
  description: The GetPositionWithOffset method retrieves a specific offset value
    associated with the transport base, likely used for positioning or synchronization
    purposes within the game world. This method is typically invoked when calculating
    or retrieving the current location of a transport entity such as a boat, zeppelin,
    or other moving object in the game. The returned integer represents an offset
    that may be used to determine relative positioning or movement state of the transport.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the position offset of the transport base.
    The exact meaning of this value depends on the context in which it's used, but
    typically represents a coordinate offset or state indicator for positioning within
    the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int offset = transportBase->GetPositionWithOffset();\n// Use offset to\
      \ determine transport position\nif (offset > 0)\n{\n    // Transport is moving\
      \ forward\n}\nelse if (offset < 0)\n{\n    // Transport is moving backward\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger transport system implementation and
    may be used in conjunction with other transport-related methods for movement calculations.
    The offset value might represent a distance, time-based position, or state indicator
    depending on the specific implementation.
