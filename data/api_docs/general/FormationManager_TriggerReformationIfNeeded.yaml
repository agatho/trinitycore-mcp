  class: FormationManager
  method: TriggerReformationIfNeeded
  signature: void FormationManager::TriggerReformationIfNeeded()
documentation:
  brief: Triggers a reformation of the formation manager if needed based on current
    group or unit state changes.
  description: The TriggerReformationIfNeeded method evaluates whether the current
    formation of units managed by the FormationManager requires a reorganization.
    This typically occurs when there are changes in the group composition, unit positions,
    or other dynamic factors that affect how the units should be arranged. The method
    checks internal state conditions and initiates a reformation process if necessary
    to maintain proper tactical positioning. It is commonly invoked during gameplay
    events such as unit movement, combat start, or group member changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Event Handler
    code: "void OnUnitMovement(Unit* unit)\n{\n    // Reformation check after unit\
      \ movement\n    formationManager->TriggerReformationIfNeeded();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Group Update Logic
    code: "void HandleGroupUpdate()\n{\n    // After adding/removing group members\n\
      \    if (group->GetMembersCount() > 0)\n    {\n        formationManager->TriggerReformationIfNeeded();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine during state
    transitions. Developers should not invoke this directly unless implementing custom
    group management logic. The method performs minimal checks and may be optimized
    for performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method excessively without proper conditions can lead to
    unnecessary processing overhead. Ensure that reformation triggers are logically
    tied to meaningful gameplay events rather than every minor state change.
