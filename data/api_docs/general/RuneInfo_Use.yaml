documentation:
  brief: Activates or consumes a rune, typically used in conjunction with player class
    abilities such as Death Knights' rune systems.
  description: The RuneInfo::Use method is responsible for activating or consuming
    a rune within the context of World of Warcraft's gameplay mechanics. This method
    is primarily utilized by classes that rely on rune-based resource management,
    most notably Death Knights. When invoked, it typically decrements the rune's cooldown
    or usage count and may trigger associated effects such as spell casting or resource
    regeneration. The method does not return any value but modifies internal state
    variables of the RuneInfo object to reflect its usage. It is expected that this
    method be called only when the rune is in a usable state, otherwise it may have
    no effect or throw an error depending on implementation details.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Death Knight Ability
    code: "RuneInfo* rune = player->GetRune(0);\nif (rune && rune->IsUsable()) {\n\
      \    rune->Use();\n    // Proceed with spell casting or resource update\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal rune management system for classes like
    Death Knights. It's important to check rune usability before calling this method
    to avoid unintended behavior. The actual implementation may vary based on the
    specific class and game version.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the rune is usable can lead
    to inconsistent state or unexpected behavior in the player's rune system. Ensure
    proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
