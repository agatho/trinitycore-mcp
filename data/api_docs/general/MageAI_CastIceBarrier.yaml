documentation:
  brief: Casts the Ice Barrier spell for the Mage AI.
  description: The CastIceBarrier method is responsible for executing the Ice Barrier
    spell within the Mage AI's behavior system. This method typically checks if the
    spell can be cast, applies necessary conditions such as mana availability and
    cooldowns, and then triggers the spell casting animation and effect. Ice Barrier
    is a defensive spell that provides damage absorption for the caster, making it
    a crucial part of a mage's survivability strategy in combat situations. The method
    is generally called during AI decision-making processes when the mage determines
    that casting Ice Barrier would benefit its current state or upcoming threat scenario.

  - title: Basic usage in Mage AI context
    code: "void SomeMageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetHealthPct() <\
      \ 30.0f)\n    {\n        CastIceBarrier();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has access to the target unit and spell casting
    capabilities. It may internally check for spell availability, mana costs, and
    cooldowns before proceeding with the actual spell cast.
  warnings: Ensure proper AI state management before calling this method, as improper
    usage might lead to invalid spell casts or performance issues due to frequent
    calls without proper conditions.
