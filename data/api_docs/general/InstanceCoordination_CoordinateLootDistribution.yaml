documentation:
  brief: Coordinates loot distribution among group members in an instance setting
  description: The CoordinateLootDistribution method manages the process of distributing
    loot items to players within a group during instance encounters. This method ensures
    that loot is properly allocated according to group rules, such as need-before-greed
    systems or loot master assignments. It handles the coordination between the group
    leader and individual player loot tracking, ensuring fair distribution and proper
    item assignment. The method typically operates within the context of World of
    Warcraft's instance management system where multiple players participate in dungeon
    or raid encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players participating
      in the instance encounter
  - name: lootItems
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the number of loot items
      to be distributed among group members
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot Distribution Coordination
    code: "void DistributeLootForInstance(Group* instanceGroup, int totalItems) {\n\
      \    InstanceCoordination coordination;\n    coordination.CoordinateLootDistribution(instanceGroup,\
      \ totalItems);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Loot Coordination with Error Handling
    code: "void AdvancedLootDistribution(Group* group, int lootCount) {\n    if (!group\
      \ || lootCount <= 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    InstanceCoordination\
      \ coordination;\n    try {\n        coordination.CoordinateLootDistribution(group,\
      \ lootCount);\n    } catch (const std::exception& e) {\n        // Handle distribution\
      \ errors\n        sLog->outError(\"Loot distribution failed: %s\", e.what());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with TrinityCore's loot system and group management
    components. It may perform checks for group validity, loot master assignment,
    and player eligibility for loot. The implementation might involve locking mechanisms
    to prevent race conditions during loot distribution.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    invalid pointers can cause crashes. The method assumes proper group state management
    and may not handle cases where players leave or join the group during distribution.
