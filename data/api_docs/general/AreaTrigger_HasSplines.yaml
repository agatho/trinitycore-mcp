  class: AreaTrigger
  method: HasSplines
  signature: bool AreaTrigger::HasSplines() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the area trigger has associated spline data for movement.
  description: The HasSplines method checks if the AreaTrigger object contains spline
    pathing information that defines its movement trajectory. This is typically used
    to determine if an area trigger will animate along a specific path rather than
    remaining stationary. The method returns true when spline data exists and false
    otherwise. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, area triggers with
    splines are often used for visual effects, such as magical auras or moving projectiles
    that follow predefined paths through the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger has spline pathing data defined; returns
    false if no spline information is present or if the area trigger is static.
  examples:
  - title: Check if AreaTrigger Has Spline Path
    code: "if (areaTrigger->HasSplines())\n{\n    // Handle animated area trigger\
      \ with movement\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"acore.area\", \"Area trigger {} has spline\
      \ pathing.\", areaTrigger->GetGUID());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle static area\
      \ trigger\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"acore.area\", \"Area trigger {} is static.\", areaTrigger->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with movement-related systems
    to determine how an area trigger should behave during its lifecycle. It's particularly
    relevant when implementing custom area trigger behaviors or debugging movement
    issues.
