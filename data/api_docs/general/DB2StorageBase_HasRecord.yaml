  class: DB2StorageBase
  method: HasRecord
  signature: bool DB2StorageBase::HasRecord(uint32 id) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a record with the specified ID exists in the DB2 storage.
  description: The HasRecord method determines if a database record with the given
    identifier is present within the DB2 storage container. This functionality is
    commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to validate data integrity and
    ensure that requested records are available before attempting to access them.
    The method performs an efficient lookup operation, typically using internal indexing
    structures to quickly determine existence without retrieving full record data.
    It is particularly useful when working with dynamic data loading or during gameplay
    logic where certain assets must exist before being referenced.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a record with the specified ID exists in the storage, false
    otherwise. The method does not throw exceptions for missing records and will simply
    return false when the ID is not found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Validate Record Existence
    code: "if (DBCStorage.HasRecord(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with accessing the record\n\
      \    auto record = DBCStorage.LookupRecord(12345);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ missing record case\n    sLog->outError(\"Record 12345 not found in DBC storage\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HasRecord in Game Logic
    code: "// Example usage in a spell effect handler\nuint32 spellId = 87654;\nif\
      \ (SpellMgr->HasRecord(spellId)) {\n    SpellInfo const* spellInfo = SpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(spellId);\n\
      \    // Apply spell logic\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid spell ID %u\
      \ encountered\", spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is optimized for performance and uses internal hash tables or
    similar data structures to provide O(1) average lookup time. It's recommended
    to use this method before calling other accessors like LookupRecord to avoid potential
    errors or undefined behavior when dealing with potentially missing records.
  warnings: While the method itself is safe to call, relying on it for critical game
    logic should be done carefully. In performance-critical sections, consider caching
    results of HasRecord calls if checking the same IDs repeatedly. Also, ensure that
    ID values passed are within expected ranges to avoid unexpected behavior or performance
    degradation.
