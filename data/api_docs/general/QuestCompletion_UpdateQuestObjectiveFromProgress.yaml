  class: QuestCompletion

  signature: void QuestCompletion::UpdateQuestObjectiveFromProgress(QuestObjectiveData
    & objective, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates a quest objective's progress based on the player's current state.
  description: The UpdateQuestObjectiveFromProgress method is responsible for advancing
    or modifying the progress of a specific quest objective associated with a player
    character. This function typically gets invoked when the player performs actions
    that contribute to completing a quest, such as killing monsters, collecting items,
    or visiting locations. It evaluates the current state of the player's progress
    and updates the corresponding quest objective data accordingly. The method ensures
    that the quest system accurately reflects the player's advancement through objectives,
    potentially triggering quest completion events if all objectives are fulfilled.
  parameters:
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific quest objective to be updated. This includes progress tracking
      data and objective requirements.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      progress is being evaluated and updated. The method uses this player's state
      to determine how to modify the objective progress.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Progression
    code: 'QuestObjectiveData myObjective;

      Player* playerBot = ...; // Assume initialized player

      UpdateQuestObjectiveFromProgress(myObjective, playerBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Kill Counters
    code: 'QuestObjectiveData killObjective;

      killObjective.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_KILL;

      killObjective.requiredCount = 10;

      killObjective.currentCount = 5;

      Player* playerBot = ...; // Assume initialized player

      UpdateQuestObjectiveFromProgress(killObjective, playerBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest progression system and should not
    be called directly unless implementing custom quest logic. It assumes that the
    provided objective data is valid and properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or invalid QuestObjectiveData
    structure may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all required fields in the
    objective are populated before invoking this function.
