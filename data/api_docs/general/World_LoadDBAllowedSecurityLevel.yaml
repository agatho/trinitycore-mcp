  signature: void World::LoadDBAllowedSecurityLevel()
documentation:
  brief: Loads the database allowed security level configuration for World of Warcraft
    server access control.
  description: The LoadDBAllowedSecurityLevel method initializes and retrieves the
    minimum security level required to access certain database features or perform
    specific administrative actions within the TrinityCore server. This method typically
    reads configuration values from the database, such as those stored in the `worldserver.conf`
    file or directly in the database tables, to enforce access restrictions based
    on user permissions. It is commonly used during server startup or configuration
    reloads to ensure that only authorized users with appropriate security levels
    can execute sensitive commands or access restricted data. The method does not
    return any value but modifies internal server state related to permission checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDBAllowedSecurityLevel()\n{\n    // Internal implementation\
      \ reads security level from database\n    // and sets up access control rules\
      \ for server operations.\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during the initialization phase of the World
    class, often after the database connection has been established. It may be called
    again if configuration reloads are supported by the server. Developers should
    ensure that the underlying database contains valid security level definitions
    to avoid unexpected access control failures.
  warnings: Improperly configured database security levels can lead to unauthorized
    access or denial of service for legitimate administrators. Ensure all security
    level values are properly validated and consistent with expected permission hierarchies
    in the game environment.
