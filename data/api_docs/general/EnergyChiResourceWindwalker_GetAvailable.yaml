  class: EnergyChiResourceWindwalker
  method: GetAvailable
  signature: uint32 EnergyChiResourceWindwalker::GetAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current available energy or chi resource value for a Windwalker
    class player.
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the current amount of energy or chi
    that a Windwalker class player has available for use. This value typically represents
    the player's resource pool which can be consumed to perform special abilities,
    such as generating chi or spending energy for attacks. The returned value is usually
    an integer representing the quantity of the resource. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is read-only in nature. It is commonly used within game
    logic to determine if a player has sufficient resources before executing certain
    actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current amount of available energy or chi
    resource for the Windwalker class player. This value typically ranges from 0 up
    to the maximum resource capacity, which may vary depending on the player's level
    and equipment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 availableEnergy = player->GetAvailable();\nif (availableEnergy >=\
      \ 50)\n{\n    // Player can perform an energy-consuming ability\n    player->UseEnergy(50);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Check Before Ability
    code: "EnergyChiResourceWindwalker* resource = player->GetEnergyChiResource();\n\
      uint32 currentResource = resource->GetAvailable();\nif (currentResource >= 100)\n\
      {\n    // Execute high-cost Windwalker ability\n    player->ExecuteWindwalkerAbility();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Notify player they don't have enough chi\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Not enough chi to perform this ability.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resource management
    functions like GetMax(), SetAvailable(), and UseResource(). The value returned
    may fluctuate based on player actions, such as gaining energy from abilities or
    spending it on attacks. Ensure that the player object is valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned value directly; use appropriate setter methods
    if resource changes are required. This method assumes the player is a Windwalker
    class character and may return unexpected values for other classes. Avoid calling
    this method in performance-critical sections without caching the result.
