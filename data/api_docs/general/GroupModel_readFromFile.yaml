documentation:
  brief: Loads group model data from a file into the GroupModel instance.
  description: The readFromFile method attempts to load group model data from an external
    file into the current GroupModel instance. This method is typically used during
    initialization or when dynamically loading group-related data such as group compositions,
    member information, or configuration settings. The method may perform validation
    on the loaded data and returns a boolean indicating success or failure of the
    operation. It's commonly used in conjunction with other group management functions
    within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the file was successfully read and the data was properly
    loaded into the GroupModel instance; otherwise, returns false if the operation
    failed due to file access issues, invalid data format, or other errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of readFromFile
    code: "GroupModel groupModel;\nbool success = groupModel.readFromFile();\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Group model data loaded successfully\n    printf(\"Group model loaded\
      \ successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle loading failure\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to load group model\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs file I/O operations and may block the calling
    thread. It's recommended to call this method during initialization phases or in
    background threads to avoid performance impact on the main game loop. The method
    may depend on specific file formats or paths defined by the TrinityCore configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper file permissions or when the expected
    file format is incorrect may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that
    the file exists and is accessible before invoking this method.
