documentation:
  brief: Updates internal tracking for spawn burst events to manage adaptive spawning
    behavior.
  description: The UpdateBurstTracking method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the state of spawn burst events within the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler class. This
    method typically monitors recent spawn activity, calculates burst rates, and adjusts
    throttling parameters accordingly to prevent excessive spawning in a short time
    frame. It plays a key role in balancing server performance and game experience
    by dynamically controlling how quickly new creatures or objects are spawned based
    on current system load and recent spawning history. The method is generally called
    during regular update cycles or when spawn events occur.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void WorldObject::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n\
      \    if (m_adaptiveSpawnThrottler)\n        m_adaptiveSpawnThrottler->UpdateBurstTracking();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly as part of the game loop to ensure
    accurate tracking of spawn bursts. It may involve internal state calculations
    that are sensitive to timing and frequency of calls.
