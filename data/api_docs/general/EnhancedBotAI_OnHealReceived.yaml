  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: OnHealReceived
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::OnHealReceived(Unit * healer, uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot receives a healing amount from another unit
  description: The OnHealReceived method is invoked when a bot in the EnhancedBotAI
    system receives healing from another unit, such as a player or NPC. This method
    allows the AI to respond to healing events by triggering specific behaviors or
    actions based on the amount of health restored and the healer's identity. It serves
    as an event handler for healing mechanics within the bot's AI framework, enabling
    customization of how bots react to being healed in various combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: healer
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that provided the healing. This can be
      a player, NPC, or any game entity capable of performing healing actions.
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of health points (HP) that was restored to the bot. This
      value represents the healing effect applied by the healer unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Reaction
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnHealReceived(Unit* healer, uint32 amount)\n{\n  \
      \  if (amount > 100)\n    {\n        // Bot responds to significant healing\
      \ with a message\n        GetBot()->Say(\"Thanks for the heal!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Healing Response Based on Healer
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnHealReceived(Unit* healer, uint32 amount)\n{\n  \
      \  if (healer && healer->IsPlayer())\n    {\n        Player* player = healer->ToPlayer();\n\
      \        // Bot checks if healer is a specific class\n        if (player->getClass()\
      \ == CLASS_PRIEST)\n        {\n            GetBot()->Say(\"Priest healing is\
      \ so reliable!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat or in situations where the
    bot's health changes due to external healing. The healer parameter may be null
    if the healing source cannot be identified, and the amount will always be a positive
    integer representing the effective healing done.
  warnings: Ensure that any logic inside this method does not cause performance bottlenecks,
    especially during high-frequency healing events. Avoid making blocking calls or
    heavy computations within this handler to prevent affecting the bot's responsiveness.
