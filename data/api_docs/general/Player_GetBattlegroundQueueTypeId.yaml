  method: GetBattlegroundQueueTypeId
  signature: int Player::GetBattlegroundQueueTypeId(uint32 index) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the battleground queue type identifier for the specified index.
  description: This method retrieves the battleground queue type identifier associated
    with a specific index in the player's battleground queue list. It is used to determine
    which battleground queue the player is currently queued for, allowing for proper
    handling of queue-related game mechanics and player interactions. The method operates
    on the player's internal queue data structure and returns an integer representing
    the queue type ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the battleground queue type identifier.
    This value corresponds to the type of battleground queue the player is currently
    queued for, such as 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 battlegrounds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int queueType = player->GetBattlegroundQueueTypeId(0);\nif (queueType >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Player is queued for a specific battleground type\n    printf(\"\
      Queue Type: %d\\n\", queueType);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal player queue management system and should
    be used carefully during queue-related operations. It's typically called when
    checking player status in battleground queues or when handling queue-related events.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine player's current battleground
    status directly without proper context, as it only returns queue type identifiers
    and does not indicate whether the player is actually in a battleground or waiting
    for one.
