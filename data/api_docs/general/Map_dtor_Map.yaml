documentation:
  brief: Destroys the Map object and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The Map::~Map() method is a destructor that handles the cleanup of
    Map objects within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures proper memory management
    and resource deallocation when a Map instance is destroyed. This method is crucial
    for maintaining game stability and preventing memory leaks, particularly in scenarios
    involving multiple map instances or dynamic map creation. The destructor typically
    handles cleanup of map-related data structures, including but not limited to grid
    data, object lists, and any allocated memory that may have been used during the
    map's lifecycle.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Map Destruction
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      // ... use map ...

      delete map;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor implementation may vary based on the specific map type (instance
    vs. dungeon). It's important to note that this method should not be called directly
    in most cases, as it is automatically invoked during object destruction. Developers
    should ensure proper cleanup of related objects before calling this destructor.
  warnings: Improper handling of Map destruction can lead to memory leaks or crashes.
    Avoid calling this destructor manually unless explicitly required by the framework's
    design. Also, ensure that all references to map objects are properly cleared before
    destruction.
