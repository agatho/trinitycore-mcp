documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the arena team has no members
  description: The Empty method determines if an arena team contains no players. It
    returns true when the team is completely devoid of members, and false if there
    are any players currently registered on the team. This method is commonly used
    to validate team state before performing operations that require a non-empty team,
    such as starting matches or distributing rewards. The check is performed by examining
    the internal member list of the arena team structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the arena team has no members, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Check if Arena Team is Empty Before Starting Match
    code: "if (!arenaTeam->Empty())\n{\n    // Proceed with match logic\n    arenaTeam->StartMatch();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle empty team case\n    sLog->outError(\"Cannot start\
      \ match: Arena team is empty\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple check on the internal member count and should
    have minimal performance impact. It's thread-safe as long as no concurrent modifications
    to the team members are occurring during the check.
