  brief: Adds the conversation object to the world environment, making it active and
    accessible to players.
  description: The AddToWorld method integrates a Conversation object into the active
    game world, enabling it to be processed and interacted with by players. This method
    typically handles internal registration within the server's world system, ensuring
    that the conversation is properly initialized and ready for use. It may also trigger
    associated events or updates necessary for the conversation to function correctly
    within the game context. The method should only be called after the conversation
    has been fully constructed and configured.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Conversation* conv = new Conversation();

      conv->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a conversation is created and should not generally be called manually unless
    implementing custom behavior. It may perform internal synchronization and registration
    tasks that are essential for proper operation.
  warnings: Calling AddToWorld on an already added conversation may lead to undefined
    behavior or duplicate registrations. Ensure that the conversation object is properly
    initialized before calling this method.
