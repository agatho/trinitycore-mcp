documentation:
  brief: Spawns bots to match the configured population target for the bot spawner.
  description: The SpawnToPopulationTarget method is responsible for managing the
    bot population by spawning new bots until the current count reaches the specified
    population target. This method typically checks the existing bot count in the
    world and creates new instances of bots according to the defined spawn rules and
    limits. It ensures that the number of active bots aligns with the desired population
    level, which is useful for maintaining consistent bot presence in areas like battlegrounds
    or player-versus-player zones. The method may also handle cleanup of excess bots
    if the current population exceeds the target.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSpawner* spawner = sBotSpawner->GetSpawnerForZone(1234);

      spawner->SpawnToPopulationTarget();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot spawner is properly initialized
    and configured with a valid population target. It may perform multiple internal
    operations including checking existing spawns, calculating required spawns, and
    creating new bot instances.
  warnings: Calling this method in rapid succession without proper cooldowns can lead
    to excessive resource consumption or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the underlying
    spawn configuration has been validated before invoking this method.
