  class: GuildIntegration
  method: ManageGuildCalendarEvents
  signature: void GuildIntegration::ManageGuildCalendarEvents(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Manages guild calendar events for a specified player.
  description: The ManageGuildCalendarEvents method handles the creation, updating,
    and deletion of calendar events within a guild context. It interacts with the
    player's calendar data to synchronize event information, ensuring that guild members
    are properly notified of upcoming activities. This method likely integrates with
    TrinityCore's calendar system and may update player state or send notifications
    to connected clients. The method operates on a single player identified by the
    provided pointer and modifies guild-related calendar entries accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the guild system. This parameter is used to determine which player's
      calendar data should be managed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.ManageGuildCalendarEvents(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal TrinityCore systems for calendar
    management and may require the player to be part of a guild. It is assumed that
    the player pointer points to a valid, connected player object.
  warnings: Ensure that the player ID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    player in the game world. Passing an invalid or null pointer could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
