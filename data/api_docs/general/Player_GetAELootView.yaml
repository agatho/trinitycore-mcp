documentation:
  brief: Returns the active loot view identifier for the player.
  description: The GetAELootView method retrieves the current loot view identifier
    associated with the player's active loot system. This identifier represents the
    specific loot table or group that the player is currently viewing in the context
    of loot distribution. The method is typically used in conjunction with loot mechanics
    to determine which loot group is being displayed or to track the player's current
    loot state during a loot event. It may be relevant for tracking loot view changes,
    especially when dealing with multiple loot groups or when using different loot
    systems such as group loot or personal loot.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the identifier of the active loot view, which
    is typically an integer that corresponds to a specific loot group or table. This
    value can be used to determine which loot view is currently active and may be
    useful for tracking changes in loot distribution or for debugging purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int lootView = player->GetAELootView();\nif (lootView > 0)\n{\n    // Do\
      \ something with the current loot view\n    std::cout << \"Current loot view:\
      \ \" << lootView << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's internal loot tracking system and should
    be used carefully when dealing with loot events. The returned value may change
    depending on the active loot group or view, and it's important to understand that
    this value represents a specific identifier rather than a direct reference to
    a physical loot table.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly in most cases without understanding
    the context of the current loot system. Misusing this method can lead to incorrect
    tracking of loot views or even errors in loot distribution logic if used improperly.
