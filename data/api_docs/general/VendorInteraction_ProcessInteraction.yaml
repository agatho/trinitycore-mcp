  class: VendorInteraction
  method: ProcessInteraction
  signature: InteractionResult VendorInteraction::ProcessInteraction(Player * bot,
    Creature * vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a vendor interaction for a bot player with a creature vendor, returning
    the result of the interaction.
  description: The ProcessInteraction method handles the logic for a bot player to
    interact with a creature vendor in World of Warcraft. It manages the vendor interaction
    flow including checking if the vendor is valid, verifying the player's ability
    to trade, and performing necessary actions such as buying or selling items. The
    method returns an InteractionResult enum that indicates whether the interaction
    was successful, failed due to various conditions, or resulted in a specific outcome
    like item purchase or sale. This method is typically used in AI-driven bot systems
    where automated players need to perform vendor interactions without manual input.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will interact
      with the vendor. Must be a valid player instance with proper initialization.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor NPC with which
      the interaction occurs. Must be a valid creature that serves as a vendor (has
      vendor data).
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum indicating the outcome of the vendor
    interaction. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED_INVALID_VENDOR, FAILED_PLAYER_NOT_FOUND,
    FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS, or other specific interaction result codes depending
    on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Interaction
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Bot player instance\nCreature* vendor = ...; // Vendor\
      \ creature instance\nInteractionResult result = VendorInteraction::ProcessInteraction(bot,\
      \ vendor);\nif (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Handle successful\
      \ interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Different Interaction Results
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nInteractionResult result =\
      \ VendorInteraction::ProcessInteraction(bot, vendor);\nswitch (result)\n{\n\
      \    case InteractionResult::SUCCESS:\n        // Vendor interaction completed\
      \ successfully\n        break;\n    case InteractionResult::FAILED_INVALID_VENDOR:\n\
      \        // Vendor is not valid or does not support trading\n        break;\n\
      \    case InteractionResult::FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS:\n        // Bot doesn't\
      \ have enough money for transaction\n        break;\n    default:\n        //\
      \ Handle other failure cases\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both the bot player and vendor creature are properly
    initialized and in valid game state. The implementation may perform checks for
    distance, vendor availability, and player state before processing interaction
    logic. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary database lookups
    or network calls during interaction processing.
  warnings: Ensure that both Player and Creature pointers are valid before calling
    this method to prevent crashes. The method may not handle all edge cases of vendor
    interactions, such as complex vendor conditions or special vendor behaviors that
    require additional handling.
