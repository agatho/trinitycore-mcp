documentation:
  brief: Retrieves coordination metrics for group operations
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a CoordinationMetrics object containing
    performance and operational statistics related to group coordination activities.
    This includes data such as synchronization counts, message processing times, and
    error rates for group-based operations within the TrinityCore framework. The returned
    metrics provide insights into how efficiently group coordination is functioning
    and can be used for monitoring, debugging, or performance optimization purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CoordinationMetrics object containing various statistical measures related
    to group coordination activities, including synchronization counters, timing data,
    and error statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log group coordination metrics
    code: "GroupCoordination* coord = sGroupCoordination->GetGroupCoordination();\n\
      CoordinationMetrics metrics = coord->GetMetrics();\nTC_LOG_INFO(\"group\", \"\
      Group Coordination Metrics - Syncs: %u, Errors: %u, Avg Time: %.2fms\",\n  \
      \  metrics.sync_count, metrics.error_count, metrics.avg_sync_time);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for diagnostic purposes and performance monitoring.
    The returned metrics are updated periodically during group operations and may
    not reflect real-time values. The CoordinationMetrics structure contains multiple
    fields that should be interpreted together to understand the overall coordination
    health.
