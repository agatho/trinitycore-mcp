  method: OnStartGrouping
  signature: void Battlefield::OnStartGrouping()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the grouping process for players entering a Battlefield.
  description: The OnStartGrouping method is called when a Battlefield begins the
    process of organizing players into teams or groups for combat. This method typically
    handles initial setup such as assigning players to factions, preparing spawn points,
    and initializing group structures. It's part of the Battlefield's lifecycle management
    and occurs before the actual battle begins. The method ensures that all players
    are properly grouped according to the battlefield's rules and faction assignments.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Battlefield Implementation
    code: "class MyBattlefield : public Battlefield\n{\npublic:\n    void OnStartGrouping()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Initialize player grouping logic\n        PreparePlayerGroups();\n\
      \        AssignFactionTeams();\n        SendGroupingNotifications();\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the battlefield's initialization
    phase. It should not be called directly by other systems unless implementing a
    custom battlefield type. The method may be called multiple times during a single
    battlefield instance depending on how the system handles group reorganization.
  warnings: Do not assume that all players have been assigned to groups when this
    method is called. Ensure proper synchronization if using multi-threaded access
    patterns. This method should not perform heavy operations as it's part of the
    initial setup phase.
