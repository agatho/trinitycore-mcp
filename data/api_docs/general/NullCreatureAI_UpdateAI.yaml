  signature: void NullCreatureAI::UpdateAI(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the AI state of a creature with no behavior.
  description: The UpdateAI method in NullCreatureAI serves as a placeholder implementation
    for creature AI updates. Since NullCreatureAI represents a creature with no actual
    AI behavior, this method performs no operations and acts as a null operation.
    It is typically used for creatures that should not perform any AI actions, such
    as stationary objects or NPCs that are intentionally disabled. The method accepts
    an integer parameter which may be used by derived AI classes but is ignored in
    the null implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that may be used by derived AI implementations.
      In NullCreatureAI, this parameter is unused and has no effect on behavior.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in creature AI update
    code: "class MyNullCreature : public Creature\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        // Call the base null AI update\n        NullCreatureAI::UpdateAI(0);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be overridden by derived AI classes. The parameter
    'param0' exists for API compatibility but does not influence behavior in the null
    implementation. It is recommended to use this class only when explicitly required
    to disable AI functionality.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are implementing a custom
    AI class that inherits from NullCreatureAI. Using it as a base class without proper
    inheritance may lead to unexpected behavior or compiler errors.
