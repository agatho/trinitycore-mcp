api:
  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: HasEnoughResource
  signature: bool DemonHunterAI::HasEnoughResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Demon Hunter has sufficient resource to cast a specified spell.
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates whether the current Demon Hunter
    AI character possesses adequate resources (such as Fury, Pain, or other class-specific
    energy) to cast a given spell. This method is typically used during AI decision-making
    processes to determine valid spell casting options. It considers the resource
    cost of the specified spell and compares it against the demon hunter's current
    resource level. The method returns true if sufficient resources are available,
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for proper AI behavior in combat
    scenarios where resource management affects spell selection and execution.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check resource requirements
      for. This ID corresponds to a specific spell defined in the TrinityCore spell
      database.
  returns: Returns true if the Demon Hunter has enough resources to cast the specified
    spell, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (ai->HasEnoughResource(204018)) // Fel Rush\n{\n    // Cast Fel Rush\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Validation Before Spell Casting
    code: "SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(204018);\nif (spellInfo\
      \ && ai->HasEnoughResource(204018))\n{\n    // Proceed with casting logic\n\
      \    ai->CastSpell(204018);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal resource tracking mechanisms within
    the DemonHunterAI class. It may cache resource values or perform quick lookups
    against spell cost data. The implementation should be efficient as it's called
    frequently during AI decision-making loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to a valid spell in the
    database, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method does not account for temporary
    resource modifiers or buffs that might affect actual casting ability.
