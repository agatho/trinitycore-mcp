  brief: Removes expired or invalid tracking data from the objective tracker
  description: The PruneStaleTrackingData method cleans up outdated or invalid entries
    from the ObjectiveTracker's internal data structures. This process ensures that
    the tracker maintains accurate and relevant information about active objectives,
    quests, or achievements. The method typically runs periodically to remove entries
    that have expired, been completed, or are no longer valid within the game state.
    It helps maintain performance by preventing accumulation of obsolete tracking
    data and ensures that players see only current and actionable objectives in their
    interface.

  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the game loop or during
    periodic cleanup operations. It may be invoked when a player logs out, reloads
    their UI, or when objectives are completed or abandoned. The pruning process usually
    involves checking timestamps, completion status, and validity of tracked objectives.
