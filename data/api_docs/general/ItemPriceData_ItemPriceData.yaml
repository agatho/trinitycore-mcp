documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ItemPriceData class with default values.
  description: The ItemPriceData constructor initializes a new instance of the ItemPriceData
    class, setting up internal data structures to store pricing information for items
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that all member variables
    are properly initialized to their default states, typically zero or null values,
    before any pricing data is populated. The initialization process is crucial for
    maintaining data integrity when working with item pricing mechanics in World of
    Warcraft's auction house and vendor systems.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Construction
    code: 'ItemPriceData priceData;

      // Constructs a new ItemPriceData object with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Auction House Context
    code: "void ProcessAuctionItem(Item* item)\n{\n    ItemPriceData priceData;\n\
      \    // Use priceData to store and retrieve pricing information\n    // for\
      \ the auctioned item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating new ItemPriceData
    objects. Developers should be aware that the object's internal state will be initialized
    to default values, and additional methods may be required to populate meaningful
    pricing data.
