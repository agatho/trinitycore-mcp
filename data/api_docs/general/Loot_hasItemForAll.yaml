  class: Loot
  method: hasItemForAll
  signature: bool Loot::hasItemForAll() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether all items in the loot have been assigned to players for distribution.
  description: The hasItemForAll method determines if every item within the current
    loot object has been marked as being distributed to at least one player. This
    is typically used during the loot distribution process to verify that all items
    are accounted for and ready for final assignment. The method returns true when
    all items have been processed for distribution, and false otherwise. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this check is crucial for ensuring proper
    loot mechanics and preventing items from being lost or duplicated during the distribution
    phase.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all items in the loot have been assigned to players for
    distribution; returns false if any item remains unassigned or if the loot is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (loot->hasItemForAll()) {\n    // All items are ready for final distribution\n\
      \    loot->finalizeLoot();\n} else {\n    // Some items still need to be assigned\n\
      \    printf(\"Items not yet assigned to players\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with loot distribution logic
    and should be called after all players have had a chance to roll for items or
    when checking if the loot can proceed to its final state. It does not modify the
    internal state of the Loot object.
