  method: SetBaseAmount
  signature: AuraCreateInfo & AuraCreateInfo::SetBaseAmount(const int32 * bp)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the base amount for an aura creation info object
  description: The SetBaseAmount method configures the base amount value that will
    be used when creating auras. This value typically represents the initial strength
    or magnitude of the aura effect. The method accepts a pointer to an array of int32
    values, which can be used to specify multiple base amounts for different aura
    levels or effects. It returns a reference to the same AuraCreateInfo object, enabling
    method chaining for fluent interface patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: bp
    description: Pointer to an array of int32 values representing the base amount(s)
      for the aura. This can be NULL if no base amount is to be set.
  returns: A reference to the AuraCreateInfo object, allowing for method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuraCreateInfo createInfo;

      int32 baseAmount = 100;

      createInfo.SetBaseAmount(&baseAmount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: "AuraCreateInfo createInfo;\nint32 amounts[2] = {50, 75};\ncreateInfo.SetDuration(30000)\n\
      \           .SetBaseAmount(amounts)\n           .SetMaxStack(5);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other aura creation parameters
    to fully define an aura's behavior. The base amount may be interpreted differently
    depending on the aura type and effect, so it's important to understand how this
    value interacts with the specific aura implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the pointer passed to this method points to valid memory that
    will remain alive for the duration of the aura creation process. Passing a null
    pointer or invalid memory can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
