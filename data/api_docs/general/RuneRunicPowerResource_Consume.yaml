  class: RuneRunicPowerResource
  method: Consume
  signature: bool RuneRunicPowerResource::Consume(uint32 runesCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified number of runes and returns true if successful.
  description: The Consume method attempts to deduct a given number of runes from
    the player's rune resource pool. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with abilities or spells that require rune consumption, such as Death Knight abilities
    in World of Warcraft. It checks whether sufficient runes are available before
    performing the deduction. If the requested amount of runes can be consumed, the
    method updates the internal rune count and returns true; otherwise, it returns
    false without modifying the rune state. The method is integral to the gameplay
    mechanics involving rune-based resource management for classes like Death Knights.
  parameters:
  - name: runesCost
    description: The number of runes to consume from the resource pool. Must be a
      positive integer representing the required rune count for an ability or spell.
  returns: True if the specified number of runes were successfully consumed; false
    if there are insufficient runes available to fulfill the request.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rune Consumption
    code: "if (player->GetRuneResource()->Consume(1)) {\n    // Proceed with ability\
      \ execution\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEATH_COIL, true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle insufficient runes\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough\
      \ runes.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming Multiple Runes
    code: "uint32 requiredRunes = 3;\nif (player->GetRuneResource()->Consume(requiredRunes))\
      \ {\n    // Execute ability requiring 3 runes\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_BLOOD_BOIL, true);\n} else {\n    // Prevent spell cast and notify user\n\
      \    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Insufficient runes to cast Blood Boil.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal rune count of the RuneRunicPowerResource
    instance. It should only be called when verifying that the ability or spell being
    used has sufficient resource requirements. The method does not perform any visual
    feedback to the player; it is expected that higher-level systems handle UI updates.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if enough runes are available may
    lead to inconsistent state. Always validate rune availability before calling Consume,
    especially in scenarios involving multiple abilities or concurrent actions.
