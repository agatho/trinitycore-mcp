  signature: Creature * NPCInteractionManager::FindNearestAuctioneer() const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the nearest auctioneer creature within the player's current
    map.
  description: The FindNearestAuctioneer method searches for the closest Creature
    object that represents an auctioneer within the same map as the calling NPCInteractionManager
    instance. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore to locate
    auction houses or auctioneers for interaction purposes, such as opening auction
    interfaces or checking auction-related services. The search considers only creatures
    that are valid auctioneers and are within the same map instance. If no valid auctioneer
    is found, the method returns a null pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Creature object representing the nearest auctioneer, or
    nullptr if no auctioneer is found within the current map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Creature* auctioneer = interactionManager->FindNearestAuctioneer();\nif\
      \ (auctioneer)\n{\n    // Interact with the auctioneer\n    player->GetSession()->SendAuctionHello(player,\
      \ auctioneer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Interaction Check
    code: "Creature* auctioneer = interactionManager->FindNearestAuctioneer();\nif\
      \ (auctioneer && auctioneer->IsAlive())\n{\n    // Proceed with auction interaction\n\
      \    player->GetSession()->SendAuctionHello(player, auctioneer);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle case where no valid auctioneer exists\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      No nearby auctioneer found.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only searches within the current map instance and does not consider
    creatures in other maps or instances. The implementation likely uses spatial indexing
    or distance calculations to efficiently locate the nearest valid auctioneer. Performance
    is generally good for typical use cases but may degrade if many creatures are
    present in the same area.
  warnings: The returned pointer should always be checked for null before use, as
    the method may return nullptr if no auctioneer exists in the current map. Additionally,
    the returned Creature object may not necessarily be alive or accessible for interaction
    even if it's found, so further validation is recommended.
