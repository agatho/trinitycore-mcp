documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the suggestion system within the support manager.
  description: The SetSuggestionSystemStatus method controls whether the suggestion
    system is active or inactive in the SupportMgr class. This functionality likely
    manages user-facing suggestions, such as feature requests or bug reports, that
    are submitted through the game's support interface. The method accepts a boolean
    parameter to set the status of the system. When enabled, users may submit suggestions;
    when disabled, the system will not accept new submissions or display suggestions.
  parameters:
  - name: status
    description: A boolean value indicating the desired state of the suggestion system.
      True enables the system, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Suggestion System
    code: 'SupportMgr* mgr = sWorld->GetSupportMgr();

      mgr->SetSuggestionSystemStatus(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Suggestion System
    code: 'SupportMgr* mgr = sWorld->GetSupportMgr();

      mgr->SetSuggestionSystemStatus(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates an internal flag within the SupportMgr class that
    controls the availability of suggestion-related functionality. It may also be
    used in conjunction with other system status management methods to ensure consistency
    across the support infrastructure.
