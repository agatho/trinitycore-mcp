  class: ObjectMgr
  method: GetPhasesForArea
  signature: const int * ObjectMgr::GetPhasesForArea(uint32 areaId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of phases associated with a specified area ID.
  description: The GetPhasesForArea method returns a constant pointer to an array
    of integers representing the phase IDs that are active or relevant for the given
    area ID. This functionality is crucial in World of Warcraft's phased content system,
    where different areas may be visible or accessible only during specific game phases.
    The returned array is typically managed internally by the ObjectMgr class and
    should not be modified by external code. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input areaId, so calling it with an invalid ID may result in undefined
    behavior or return an empty phase list.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing the phase IDs associated
    with the specified area. The caller must not modify the returned array. If no
    phases are defined for the given area, the method may return a null pointer or
    an empty array depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Phases for an Area
    code: "const int* phases = sObjectMgr->GetPhasesForArea(1234);\nif (phases !=\
      \ nullptr) {\n    for (int i = 0; phases[i] != 0; ++i) {\n        printf(\"\
      Phase ID: %d\\n\", phases[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is typically null-terminated. The method relies on internal
    data structures that are populated during server startup or when areas are loaded.
    This function is commonly used in area-based phase checking logic, such as determining
    whether a player can see certain objects or interact with specific game elements
    based on their current phase.
  warnings: The returned pointer points to internal memory managed by ObjectMgr. Do
    not attempt to free or modify the array contents. If the method returns null,
    it indicates either an invalid area ID or no phases are configured for that area.
    Always check for null before using the returned value.
