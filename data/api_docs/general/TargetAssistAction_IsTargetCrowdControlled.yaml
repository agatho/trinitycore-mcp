  signature: bool TargetAssistAction::IsTargetCrowdControlled(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the target unit is currently under any crowd control effect.
  description: The IsTargetCrowdControlled method determines whether a given target
    unit is currently affected by any form of crowd control (CC) mechanics such as
    stuns, fears, root effects, or other disabling abilities. This is commonly used
    in AI behavior logic to decide when a unit should be prioritized for attack or
    avoided during combat. The method evaluates the target's current state and returns
    true if any CC debuff is active on the unit, otherwise false. It typically checks
    against a predefined set of spell effects that are classified as crowd control
    abilities within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is currently under any crowd control effect;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (bot->GetAI()->IsTargetCrowdControlled(target)) {\n    // Target is\
      \ CC'd, prioritize attacking or using abilities\n    bot->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_STUN, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Target Selection Logic
    code: "if (!IsTargetCrowdControlled(unit)) {\n    // Only consider non-CC'd targets\
      \ for certain abilities\n    if (CanUseAbility(unit, ABILITY_SILENCE)) {\n \
      \       bot->CastSpell(unit, ABILITY_SILENCE, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal tracking of debuffs and their classification
    as crowd control effects. Performance is generally low as it involves checking
    a unit's current aura state, but should be used judiciously in high-frequency
    AI loops. The implementation may vary based on how TrinityCore defines and categorizes
    CC spells.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. Some CC effects might not be immediately
    detected if they are applied very recently, due to delay in aura application processing.
