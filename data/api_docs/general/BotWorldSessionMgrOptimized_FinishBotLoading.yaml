  signature: bool BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::FinishBotLoading(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Completes the loading process for a bot player identified by GUID
  description: The FinishBotLoading method finalizes the initialization sequence for
    a bot player within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that all necessary resources,
    data structures, and game state components are properly set up and synchronized
    for the bot to become fully functional in the world. This method typically follows
    initial bot creation or loading operations and handles any remaining setup required
    for the bot to interact with the game environment. The method performs validation
    checks on the provided player GUID to ensure it corresponds to a valid bot entity
    before proceeding with the completion logic.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player character to complete
      loading for. This should be a valid player GUID that was previously registered
      or initialized as a bot within the system.
  returns: Returns true if the bot loading process was successfully completed for
    the specified player GUID, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate
    invalid GUID, failed resource allocation, or other initialization errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FinishBotLoading
    code: "BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized* sessionMgr = BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::instance();\n\
      bool success = sessionMgr->FinishBotLoading(12345);\nif (success) {\n    //\
      \ Bot loading completed successfully\n    printf(\"Bot loaded successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failed bot loading\n    printf(\"Failed to load\
      \ bot\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after a bot has been initialized but before
    it can be used in gameplay. It may involve synchronization with other subsystems
    such as the player session manager or world state handlers. The method assumes
    that the provided GUID refers to an existing bot entity and does not perform checks
    for duplicate loading.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or system errors. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a
    properly initialized bot before invoking this method. This method should not be
    called concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization mechanisms.
