  method: DelegateToSpecialization
  signature: void MageAI::DelegateToSpecialization(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Delegates AI behavior to the appropriate specialization-specific logic for
    a Mage unit.
  description: The DelegateToSpecialization method in the MageAI class routes the
    AI's decision-making process to specialization-specific implementations. This
    allows the Mage AI to dynamically adapt its behavior based on the current specialization
    (Arcane, Fire, or Frost) of the unit. The method likely evaluates the mage's current
    state, spell availability, and combat situation to determine which specialization-specific
    AI logic should be executed. It serves as a central dispatcher for specialization-based
    AI behaviors within the Mage class.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Unit that the mage AI is currently considering
      for action. This parameter determines the context for specialization-specific
      behavior decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Mage AI context
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n     \
      \   return;\n    \n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n    DelegateToSpecialization(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell casting logic
    code: "void MageAI::DoAction(int32 action)\n{\n    switch (action)\n    {\n  \
      \      case ACTION_CAST_SPELL:\n            if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n\
      \                DelegateToSpecialization(target);\n            break;\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves runtime specialization detection and may cache
    specialization state for performance. The actual specialization-specific behavior
    is probably implemented in separate methods like ArcaneSpell(), FireSpell(), or
    FrostSpell().
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. The method assumes that the AI has been properly
    initialized with a valid Unit context.
