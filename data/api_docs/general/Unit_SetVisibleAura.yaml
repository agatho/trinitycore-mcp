  brief: Sets the visible aura application for a unit, making it appear to all nearby
    players.
  description: This method is used to set a specific aura application on a Unit object,

    application is properly displayed to nearby players, and it typically involves
    setting up the proper visibility flags for the aura. This method is part of the
    core World of Warcraft mechanics for managing unit aura states and visibility.
