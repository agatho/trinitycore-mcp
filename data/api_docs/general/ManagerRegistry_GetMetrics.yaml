  signature: int ManagerRegistry::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current metrics value from the ManagerRegistry instance.
  description: The GetMetrics method is a const accessor function that returns an
    integer representing the current metrics value stored within the ManagerRegistry
    class. This method provides read-only access to internal performance or operational
    data that may be used for monitoring, logging, or administrative purposes. The
    returned value typically reflects aggregated statistics or counters related to
    manager operations, such as active instances, processed requests, or system load
    indicators. Since this is a const method, it does not modify any member variables
    and can be safely called from const contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the current metrics. The specific meaning
    of this value depends on the implementation context but typically indicates operational
    statistics such as active managers, processed events, or system resource usage
    counts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ManagerRegistry& registry = ManagerRegistry::Instance();

      int currentMetrics = registry.GetMetrics();

      std::cout << "Current metrics value: " << currentMetrics << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is marked as const, ensuring thread safety when reading the metrics
    value. It should not be used for modifying internal state. The actual meaning
    and range of returned values depend on how the ManagerRegistry implementation
    tracks and updates its metrics.
