  signature: void Guild::_UpdateAccountsNumber()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the total number of accounts associated with the guild members.
  description: The _UpdateAccountsNumber method recalculates and stores the count
    of unique account identifiers linked to all current guild members. This internal
    method is typically invoked when guild membership changes occur, such as when
    players join or leave the guild, to ensure that the guild's account statistics
    remain accurate. It helps in tracking guild diversity and player engagement across
    different accounts within the same guild. The method operates on the internal
    state of the Guild class and does not directly interact with external systems
    or databases.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic account number update during guild membership change
    code: "void Guild::AddMember(Player* player)\n{\n    // ... existing code to add\
      \ member ...\n    _UpdateAccountsNumber(); // Update account count after adding\
      \ new member\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal helper function and should not be called directly
    by external code. It's designed to maintain consistency in guild statistics and
    is usually triggered automatically by other guild management methods when membership
    changes occur.
