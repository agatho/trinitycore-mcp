  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ProcessQuestTurnIn(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the turn-in of a quest for a player character, handling quest completion
    logic and rewards.
  description: The ProcessQuestTurnIn method is responsible for managing the completion
    of a quest by a player character in the TrinityCore framework. It validates that
    the specified quest can be turned in by the given player, checks if all prerequisites
    are met, and then awards the appropriate quest rewards such as experience points,
    gold, items, and reputation changes. This method integrates with the core quest
    system to ensure proper progression and reward distribution when a player completes
    a quest objective. The method assumes that the player has already met the necessary
    conditions for quest completion and focuses solely on the turn-in process itself.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who is turning
      in the quest. Must be a valid player instance with active quest data.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest being turned in. Must correspond to
      a valid quest in the game database that has been previously accepted by the
      player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestTurnIn::ProcessQuestTurnIn(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Turn-In with Validation
    code: "if (player->HasQuest(questId) && player->GetQuestStatus(questId) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n\
      {\n    QuestTurnIn::ProcessQuestTurnIn(player, questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core quest system upon
    successful completion of a quest objective. Developers should ensure that all
    preconditions for quest completion are validated before calling this method. The
    method does not perform any validation on the player's quest status or eligibility;
    it assumes these checks have already been performed.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the quest is actually complete
    may result in incorrect reward distribution or game state corruption. Always validate
    quest status and requirements prior to invoking ProcessQuestTurnIn.
