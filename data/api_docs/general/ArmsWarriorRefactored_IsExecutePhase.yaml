  method: IsExecutePhase
  signature: bool ArmsWarriorRefactored::IsExecutePhase(::Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Arms Warrior is currently in Execute phase based on
    target health percentage.
  description: The IsExecutePhase method evaluates if the Arms Warrior should enter
    or remain in Execute phase, which is a combat state where certain abilities become
    more effective. This typically occurs when the target's health drops below a specific
    threshold, usually around 20% for Arms Warriors. The method checks the current
    target's health percentage against this threshold to determine if Execute mechanics
    should be active. It is commonly used in AI decision-making logic to select appropriate
    abilities during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current target is below the Execute phase threshold
    (typically 20% health), indicating that Execute abilities should be prioritized
    or activated. Returns false otherwise, meaning standard combat abilities should
    be used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->IsExecutePhase(target)) {\n    // Use Execute-specific\
      \ abilities\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_EXECUTE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking execute phase before ability selection
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->IsExecutePhase(target)) {\n    if (player->HasSpell(SPELL_SWORD_AND_BOARD))\
      \ {\n        player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SWORD_AND_BOARD, true);\n    }\
      \ else {\n        player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_EXECUTE, true);\n    }\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Use normal rotation\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_MORTAL_STRIKE,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the Warrior's AI logic to make tactical
    decisions about ability usage. The exact health threshold for Execute phase may
    vary based on talent specialization and gear level. Implementation may also consider
    additional factors like target buffs or debuffs that affect when Execute mechanics
    become active.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only evaluates the current target's health percentage.
    It does not account for other factors such as target immunity, boss mechanics,
    or special encounter conditions that might prevent Execute abilities from being
    usable. Always validate ability usability before casting in practical implementations.
