documentation:
  brief: Optimizes group efficiency within an instance by adjusting player positioning
    and resource allocation.
  description: The OptimizeGroupEfficiency method in the InstanceCoordination class
    is responsible for enhancing the performance and coordination of players within
    a shared instance environment. This method analyzes the current group composition,
    player roles, and instance requirements to dynamically adjust positioning, resource
    distribution, and encounter strategies. It ensures that groups operate at peak
    efficiency by minimizing overlap, maximizing damage output, and optimizing healing
    assignments. The method typically runs during instance entry or when significant
    changes occur in group dynamics, such as player joins or leaves. It may also be
    triggered automatically based on instance difficulty or encounter mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    InstanceCoordination::OptimizeGroupEfficiency(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore instance management
    system. It may modify group assignments and player positioning without direct
    user intervention. Performance impact is minimal as it's designed to be lightweight
    and efficient.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly on groups that are already in combat
    or during critical encounter phases, as it may disrupt ongoing mechanics. The
    method assumes valid group data and will not handle malformed group structures
    gracefully.
