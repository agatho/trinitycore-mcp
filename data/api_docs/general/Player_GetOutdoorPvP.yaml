documentation:
  brief: Returns the OutdoorPvP object associated with the player's current zone.
  description: This method retrieves the active OutdoorPvP instance that is currently
    managing the player's zone. It provides access to the OutdoorPvP system which
    handles player versus player combat in outdoor areas, such as battlegrounds and
    zones with specific PvP mechanics. The method returns a pointer to the OutdoorPvP
    object if one exists for the current zone, or NULL if no active OutdoorPvP is
    present. This allows developers to interact with the PvP system directly, including
    checking status, triggering events, or managing player participation in PvP activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the OutdoorPvP object currently managing the player's
    zone, or NULL if no such object exists. The returned pointer may be null when
    the player is not in an outdoor PvP area or when no active OutdoorPvP instance
    has been initialized for the current zone.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (OutdoorPvP* pvp = player->GetOutdoorPvP()) {\n    // Player is in an\
      \ outdoor PvP area\n    // Do something with the pvp object\n}\nelse {\n   \
      \ // Player is not in an outdoor PvP area\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used to determine if a player is currently participating
    in an OutdoorPvP zone, and can be useful for implementing custom PvP mechanics
    or checking whether certain events should trigger. Performance-wise, this method
    does not involve any expensive operations as it simply returns a cached pointer.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as the returned pointer may be NULL
    if no active OutdoorPvP exists in the current zone. Always check for null before
    dereferencing the pointer to avoid crashes or undefined behavior.
