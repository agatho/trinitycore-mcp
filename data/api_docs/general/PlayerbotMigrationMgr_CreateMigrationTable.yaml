  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: CreateMigrationTable
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::CreateMigrationTable()
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new migration table for player bot data in the database.
  description: The CreateMigrationTable method initializes and sets up a new database
    table specifically designed for storing player bot migration data. This table
    typically contains information about player bot configurations, states, and any
    necessary metadata required during the migration process from one version of player
    bot functionality to another. The method ensures that all necessary columns and
    constraints are properly defined within the database schema. It is usually invoked
    during system initialization or when upgrading player bot functionality to ensure
    compatibility with new features or data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the migration table was successfully created or already
    exists, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate a database access
    error, insufficient permissions, or other issues preventing table creation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr* mgr = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance();\nbool success\
      \ = mgr->CreateMigrationTable();\nif (success)\n{\n    // Migration table created\
      \ successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"playerbots\", \"Player bot migration table created\
      \ successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to create migration table\n \
      \   LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\", \"Failed to create player bot migration table.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during system initialization or when a
    database schema update is required. It's typically not thread-safe and should
    be executed in a single-threaded context to prevent race conditions. The implementation
    assumes that the underlying database connection is already established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper checks may result in
    errors if the table already exists. Ensure that appropriate error handling is
    implemented to gracefully handle cases where the table creation fails due to permissions
    or schema conflicts.
