documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new performance window instance for tracking system performance
    metrics.
  description: The PerformanceWindow constructor initializes a new instance of the
    PerformanceWindow class, setting up internal data structures used to monitor and
    record performance statistics. This class is typically used within TrinityCore's
    performance monitoring subsystem to track various metrics such as update times,
    memory usage, and frame rates. The constructor prepares the object for use in
    performance analysis without requiring additional setup. It ensures that all internal
    counters and timers are properly initialized to zero or default values before
    any measurements begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a PerformanceWindow Instance
    code: 'PerformanceWindow window;

      // The window is now ready to track performance metrics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any expensive operations or system calls.
    It simply initializes internal state variables. The actual performance tracking
    must be initiated separately through other methods in the class.
