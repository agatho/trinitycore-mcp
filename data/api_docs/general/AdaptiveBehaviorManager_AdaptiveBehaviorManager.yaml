  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::AdaptiveBehaviorManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new adaptive behavior manager instance for the specified player
    bot.
  description: The AdaptiveBehaviorManager constructor initializes a new instance
    of the adaptive behavior manager class, associating it with a specific player
    bot. This manager is responsible for dynamically adjusting AI behaviors based
    on in-game conditions, player actions, and environmental factors. The initialization
    process sets up internal data structures and state tracking necessary for adaptive
    decision-making. This method should only be called during the creation or setup
    phase of a bot's lifecycle, typically when integrating AI behavior into a player-controlled
    NPC or automated character.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this adaptive
      behavior manager will control. Must not be null and must represent a valid player
      instance in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Adaptive Behavior Manager
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = new AdaptiveBehaviorManager(myBot);

      // The behavior manager is now initialized and ready to manage adaptive behaviors
      for myBot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs memory allocation for internal AI state
    tracking structures. It may also register the manager with global AI systems or
    initialize various behavior modules. Developers should ensure that the bot parameter
    is a valid, fully constructed Player object before calling this constructor.
  warnings: Calling this constructor with a null bot pointer will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player object is properly initialized
    and exists in the game world before creating an AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance.
