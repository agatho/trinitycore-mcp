  method: AdaptToGameMeta
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::AdaptToGameMeta()
documentation:
  brief: Adapts the behavior of an AI unit to the current game meta and environment
    conditions.
  description: The AdaptToGameMeta method adjusts the decision-making logic and behavioral
    patterns of an AI unit based on the evolving game meta, including factors such
    as player behavior trends, current battleground dynamics, and environmental conditions.
    This method is typically invoked during AI update cycles to ensure that the unit's
    actions remain relevant and effective in the current gameplay context. It may
    modify internal state variables, adjust strategy weights, or switch between different
    behavioral modes depending on the detected game meta.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Adaptation Call
    code: "void MyAIUnit::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n \
      \   m_behaviorAdaptation.AdaptToGameMeta();\n    // ... rest of update logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly during the AI's update loop.
    It may perform lightweight operations or more intensive analysis depending on
    implementation details. The adaptation process should ideally be non-blocking
    and not affect the responsiveness of the AI unit.
  warnings: Ensure that AdaptToGameMeta does not introduce race conditions if called
    from multiple threads. Avoid performing heavy computations within this method
    to prevent performance degradation in the AI update cycle.
