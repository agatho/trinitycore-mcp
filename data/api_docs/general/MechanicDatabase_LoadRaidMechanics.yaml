  signature: void MechanicDatabase::LoadRaidMechanics()
documentation:
  brief: Loads raid mechanics data from the database into memory for use during gameplay.
  description: The LoadRaidMechanics method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with raid-related mechanic definitions stored in the TrinityCore database.
    This includes loading information about boss abilities, encounter mechanics, and
    special effects that are applied during raid encounters. The method typically
    executes during server startup or when the game world is initialized to ensure
    all raid mechanics are available for encounter handling. It processes database
    entries related to raid mechanics and caches them for efficient lookup during
    active raids.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'MechanicDatabase mechanicDb;

      mechanicDb.LoadRaidMechanics(); // Called during server startup to load raid
      mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during server initialization and should
    not be invoked repeatedly. The loaded data is cached in memory for fast access
    during raid encounters, so performance is optimized after the initial load. This
    method may block execution until database queries complete.
