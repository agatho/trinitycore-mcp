  class: MultiPersonalPhaseTracker
  method: LoadGrid
  signature: void MultiPersonalPhaseTracker::LoadGrid(const PhaseShift & phaseShift,
    int & grid, Map * map, const Cell & cell)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes phase data for a specific grid cell within a map based
    on the provided phase shift information.
  description: The LoadGrid method is responsible for handling the loading and processing
    of phase-related data for a given grid cell in a World of Warcraft map. It takes
    a PhaseShift object that defines the current phase state, an integer reference
    to a grid identifier, a pointer to the Map object where the grid resides, and
    a Cell object representing the specific cell within that grid. This method is
    typically used during map loading or phase transition scenarios to ensure that
    all relevant objects within the specified grid are correctly phased according
    to the provided phase shift data. The method updates the internal state of the
    MultiPersonalPhaseTracker to reflect the new phase configuration for the given
    grid and cell.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: A const reference to a PhaseShift object that contains the phase
      information to be applied to the specified grid. This includes phase masks,
      phase groups, and other relevant phase data that determines how objects within
      the grid should be phased.
  - name: grid
    description: An integer reference that represents the grid identifier where the
      phase shift is to be applied. The method may modify this value to reflect any
      changes in grid assignment or processing state during the load operation.
  - name: map
    description: A pointer to the Map object that contains the grid being processed.
      This parameter provides context for the map's coordinate system and phase handling
      logic.
  - name: cell
    description: A const reference to a Cell object that defines the specific cell
      within the grid that should be affected by the phase shift. The cell coordinates
      determine which objects are included in the phase processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Grid Loading with Phase Shift
    code: 'PhaseShift phase;

      phase.AddPhase(123);

      int gridId = 5;

      Map* mapPtr = player->GetMap();

      Cell cell(10, 15);

      tracker.LoadGrid(phase, gridId, mapPtr, cell);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal phase management system in TrinityCore
    and is typically invoked during map loading or when players enter new areas. It's
    crucial for maintaining proper visibility and interaction states between players
    and objects across different phases.
