  method: SelectSpellCast
  signature: TargetedSpell PlayerAI::SelectSpellCast(PossibleSpellVector & spells)
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the most appropriate spell to cast from a list of possible
    spells based on AI decision-making logic.
  description: The SelectSpellCast method evaluates a vector of possible spells and
    determines the optimal spell to cast for the player's current AI state. This method
    is typically used by PlayerAI implementations to make intelligent casting decisions
    during combat or other interactive scenarios. It considers factors such as spell
    range, target validity, mana costs, cooldowns, and spell priority to select the
    best available option. The method returns a TargetedSpell structure that contains
    both the selected spell ID and its intended target.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a TargetedSpell object containing the ID of the selected spell
    and its target. If no valid spell can be selected, the returned structure may
    have invalid or default values indicating no action should be taken.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "PossibleSpellVector spells;\n// ... populate spells vector with possible\
      \ spells ...\nTargetedSpell selected = playerAI->SelectSpellCast(spells);\n\
      if (selected.spellId != 0)\n{\n    // Execute the selected spell on the specified\
      \ target\n    player->CastSpell(selected.target, selected.spellId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making system and should be called
    regularly during AI update cycles. The implementation may vary depending on the
    specific PlayerAI subclass (e.g., melee, ranged, spellcaster). Developers should
    ensure that the input spell vector contains valid and actionable spells before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the input PossibleSpellVector is properly populated with valid
    spell data; otherwise, the method may return invalid results. Be cautious when
    using this method in high-frequency update loops as it may contain performance-sensitive
    logic.
