documentation:
  brief: Initializes and configures a trait configuration packet for the player.
  description: The CreateTraitConfig method prepares a WorldPackets::Traits::TraitConfig
    object with the player's current trait data. This method is typically used when
    sending trait information to the client, ensuring that the player's selected traits,
    their ranks, and associated cooldowns are properly serialized into a packet format.
    The method likely accesses internal trait state managed by the Player class and
    populates the provided traitConfig parameter accordingly. It serves as part of
    the broader trait system implementation in TrinityCore, which supports character
    specialization and talent management.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'WorldPackets::Traits::TraitConfig traitConfig;

      player->CreateTraitConfig(traitConfig);

      // traitConfig is now populated with player''s trait data

      // Can be sent to client via WorldSession::SendPacket()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal trait storage and may depend on
    the player having completed trait initialization. It should only be called when
    the player is ready to send trait data to the client, typically after login or
    upon trait changes.
