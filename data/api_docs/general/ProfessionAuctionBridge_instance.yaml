documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ProfessionAuctionBridge class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the ProfessionAuctionBridge
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access global auction-related functionality
    for professions within the TrinityCore framework. The returned instance manages
    auction data and operations specific to player professions such as engineering,
    leatherworking, or enchanting. It serves as a central point for handling profession-based
    auction house interactions and data synchronization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single instance of ProfessionAuctionBridge. Returns nullptr
    if the instance has not been initialized yet, though this scenario is unlikely
    in normal operation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the singleton instance
    code: "ProfessionAuctionBridge* bridge = ProfessionAuctionBridge::instance();\n\
      if (bridge)\n{\n    // Use the bridge for profession auction operations\n  \
      \  bridge->ProcessAuctionUpdate();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using instance in auction event handling
    code: "void HandleProfessionAuctionEvent()\n{\n    ProfessionAuctionBridge* bridge\
      \ = ProfessionAuctionBridge::instance();\n    if (bridge && bridge->IsAuctionActive())\n\
      \    {\n        bridge->UpdateProfessionAuctions();\n        bridge->SendAuctionNotifications();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The instance
    is typically initialized during server startup or on first access. Since this
    is a global singleton, it should be used carefully to avoid tight coupling in
    code design. The class likely handles thread safety internally given its role
    in auction systems.
  warnings: Avoid storing references to the singleton instance for extended periods
    as it may lead to issues if the singleton is reset or reinitialized. Also, be
    cautious about using this in multi-threaded contexts where race conditions might
    occur during initialization.
