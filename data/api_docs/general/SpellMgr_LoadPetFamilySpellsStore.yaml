documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes pet family spell data from the database into memory
    for use in spell processing.
  description: The LoadPetFamilySpellsStore method is responsible for loading pet
    family spell information from the database into an internal storage structure
    within the SpellMgr class. This data typically includes spells that are specific
    to certain pet families (such as cats, wolves, or birds) and are used during pet
    behavior and spell activation logic in World of Warcraft. The method is usually
    invoked during server startup or database reload operations to ensure that all
    pet-related spell data is available for runtime use. It reads from the relevant
    database tables containing pet family spell mappings and stores them in memory
    for fast lookup during spell casting and pet AI processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeSpellManager()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadPetFamilySpellsStore();\n\
      \    // Pet family spells are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or database
    reloads. It's important to note that this method modifies internal data structures
    of SpellMgr and should not be called while spell processing threads are active,
    as it may cause race conditions. The method assumes that the database connection
    is already established and functional.
  warnings: This method directly accesses the database and modifies internal caches.
    It should never be called from within a spell processing context to avoid potential
    deadlocks or inconsistent data states. Also, calling this method multiple times
    without proper cleanup may result in duplicate entries or memory leaks.
