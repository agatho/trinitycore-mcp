  brief: Handles the merging of an item from the player's inventory into a guild bank
    slot.
  description: The HandleMergeItemWithGuildBankItem method processes a client request
    to merge an item from the player's personal inventory into a specified guild bank
    slot. This operation typically occurs when a player attempts to deposit items
    into their guild's bank storage. The method validates the player's permissions,
    checks if the target guild bank slot is valid, and ensures that the item being
    merged is compatible with the existing item in the slot (if any). It also verifies
    that the player has sufficient access rights to perform the action within the
    guild context.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMergeItemWithGuildBankItem(WorldPackets::Guild::MergeItemWithGuildBankItem&\
      \ mergeItemWithGuildBankItem)\n{\n    // Process the packet to merge item from\
      \ player inventory into guild bank\n    // Implementation would validate permissions\
      \ and perform the actual merge\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the guild banking system in TrinityCore. It assumes
    that the client has already validated basic input parameters before sending the
    packet to the server. The actual merging logic may involve updating both player
    and guild database entries.
