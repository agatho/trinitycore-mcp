  class: ActivePlayerUnk901
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ActivePlayerUnk901::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes player creation data to a network packet buffer for transmission to
    a client.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of an ActivePlayerUnk901
    object into a ByteBuffer, which is typically used to construct a network message
    sent to a specific player client. This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet
    handling system and is responsible for preparing the data needed to inform the
    client about the existence and attributes of a player object in the game world.
    It takes into account both the owner (the player whose data is being written)
    and the receiver (the player who will receive this information), allowing for
    conditional serialization based on visibility rules or other game logic. The method
    does not return any value but modifies the provided ByteBuffer directly.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized player creation
      data will be written. This buffer is typically used to construct a network packet.
  - name: owner
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose data is being serialized. This
      represents the player entity that owns or is associated with this ActivePlayerUnk901
      instance.
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object who will receive the constructed packet.
      Used for determining visibility and access restrictions during serialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet construction
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Some player object

      Player* receiver = ...; // Target player receiving the packet

      ActivePlayerUnk901 instance;

      instance.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send ''data'' over network to ''receiver''

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during world object updates or when sending
    initial player data to a client. It may involve checks for visibility, faction
    status, and other game-specific conditions that determine what information should
    be included in the packet.
