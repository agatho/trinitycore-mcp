  class: BotThreatManager
  method: EstimateFutureThreat
  signature: float BotThreatManager::EstimateFutureThreat(Unit * target, uint32 timeAheadMs)
documentation:
  brief: Estimates the threat level a bot will generate on a target over a specified
    time period.
  description: The EstimateFutureThreat method calculates and returns an estimated
    threat value that a bot will accumulate against a given target unit over a defined
    time interval. This estimation takes into account various factors such as the
    bot's current abilities, attack patterns, spell usage, and the target's defensive
    capabilities. The method is typically used by AI systems to make tactical decisions
    regarding targeting, threat management, and combat prioritization. It helps in
    determining whether a bot should focus on a particular enemy or shift attention
    to another unit based on projected threat levels.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target against which
      threat is being estimated. Must be a valid Unit instance; null pointers will
      result in undefined behavior.
  - name: timeAheadMs
    description: Time interval in milliseconds over which the future threat is to
      be estimated. Should be a positive integer value; larger values may impact performance
      due to increased computational complexity.
  returns: A float value representing the estimated threat level that the bot will
    generate against the specified target within the given time frame. Higher values
    indicate greater threat, and the value is typically normalized or scaled according
    to game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Estimation
    code: "float threat = botThreatManager->EstimateFutureThreat(targetUnit, 5000);\
      \ // Estimate threat over 5 seconds\nif (threat > 100.0f)\n{\n    // Consider\
      \ switching targets or increasing aggression\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Threat Estimation for Target Selection
    code: "Unit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nfloat highestThreat = 0.0f;\nfor (auto& target\
      \ : possibleTargets)\n{\n    float threat = botThreatManager->EstimateFutureThreat(target,\
      \ 3000);\n    if (threat > highestThreat)\n    {\n        highestThreat = threat;\n\
      \        bestTarget = target;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestTarget for next combat action"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs internal calculations based on bot AI state, including
    current abilities, cooldowns, and attack patterns. It may not account for all
    dynamic factors such as sudden environmental changes or complex spell interactions.
    For performance-critical applications, consider caching results or limiting the
    frequency of calls.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'target' will likely cause a crash or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the target unit is valid and alive before calling this method.
    Large values for 'timeAheadMs' may lead to significant computational overhead.
