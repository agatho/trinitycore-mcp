  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateTransport
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateTransport(HighGuid type, uint32 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new ObjectGuid for a transport entity using the specified
    high GUID type and counter value.
  description: The CreateTransport method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically
    designed for transport entities within the TrinityCore framework. It utilizes
    the provided HighGuid type to determine the category of the transport and combines
    it with the given counter value to form a complete, globally unique identifier.
    This method is typically used during world object initialization or when spawning
    new transport entities such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving platforms in
    Azeroth. The generated GUID ensures that each transport entity can be uniquely
    identified throughout the game world and properly managed by the core systems.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The HighGuid type specifying the category of the transport entity
      (e.g., HIGHGUID_TRANSPORT). This determines how the GUID is structured and which
      subsystem will handle the object.
  - name: counter
    description: A unique counter value used to distinguish between different instances
      of the same transport type. This value should be incremented for each new transport
      created to ensure uniqueness.
  returns: An ObjectGuid instance representing the unique identifier for the newly
    created transport entity. The returned GUID contains both the high and low portions
    necessary for identifying the transport within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Transport GUID
    code: ObjectGuid transportGuid = guidFactory.CreateTransport(HIGHGUID_TRANSPORT,
      12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Transport GUID in Object Creation
    code: 'Transport* transport = new Transport();

      transport->SetGUID(guidFactory.CreateTransport(HIGHGUID_TRANSPORT, GetNextTransportCounter()));

      transport->Spawn();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ObjectGuidFactory has been properly initialized
    with valid internal state and that the HighGuid type provided is supported for
    transport entities. The counter value should be managed carefully to avoid collisions,
    especially in multi-threaded environments where multiple transports may be created
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the counter value passed to this method is unique across all
    transport instances to prevent GUID conflicts. Using an invalid HighGuid type
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect object handling within the game
    world.
