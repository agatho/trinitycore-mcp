  class: ComplaintTicket
  method: GetMajorCategory
  signature: ReportMajorCategory ComplaintTicket::GetMajorCategory() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the major category identifier for a complaint ticket.
  description: The GetMajorCategory method returns the primary classification of a
    complaint ticket. This value represents the overarching issue type that the player
    reported, such as 'Gameplay', 'Behavior', or 'Technical'. The returned ReportMajorCategory
    enum value determines how the ticket is routed within the complaint handling system
    and influences the administrative response protocol. This method does not modify
    any internal state of the ticket object and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A ReportMajorCategory enum value indicating the primary category of the
    complaint. Possible values include but are not limited to: REPORT_MAJOR_CATEGORY_GAMEPLAY,
    REPORT_MAJOR_CATEGORY_BEHAVIOR, REPORT_MAJOR_CATEGORY_TECHNICAL, and REPORT_MAJOR_CATEGORY_OTHER.
    The exact enumeration values depend on the current TrinityCore implementation.'
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Major Category of a Complaint
    code: "ComplaintTicket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\nif\
      \ (ticket)\n{\n    ReportMajorCategory majorCat = ticket->GetMajorCategory();\n\
      \    switch (majorCat)\n    {\n        case REPORT_MAJOR_CATEGORY_GAMEPLAY:\n\
      \            // Handle gameplay-related complaint\n            break;\n    \
      \    case REPORT_MAJOR_CATEGORY_BEHAVIOR:\n            // Handle behavior-related\
      \ complaint\n            break;\n        default:\n            // Handle other\
      \ categories\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const and thread-safe, making it safe to call from multiple
    threads without synchronization. The major category is set when the ticket is
    created and should not change during the ticket's lifetime.
