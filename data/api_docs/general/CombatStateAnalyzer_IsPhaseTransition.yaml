  method: IsPhaseTransition
  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::IsPhaseTransition() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current combat state represents a phase transition
    event.
  description: The IsPhaseTransition method checks if the current combat scenario
    involves a phase change, such as transitioning from one combat phase to another
    (e.g., entering or exiting a boss encounter phase). This method is typically used
    by combat analysis systems to identify significant shifts in engagement behavior.
    The result indicates whether the system should process special handling for phase-based
    combat events rather than standard combat logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current combat state represents a phase transition
    event, false otherwise. A phase transition occurs when the system detects a meaningful
    change in combat context or engagement level that requires specialized handling.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "if (analyzer.IsPhaseTransition()) {\n    // Handle special phase transition\
      \ logic\n    HandlePhaseChange();\n} else {\n    // Continue normal combat processing\n\
      \    ProcessStandardCombat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state tracking of combat phases and
    may be called frequently during combat events. Developers should ensure that phase
    transition logic is properly synchronized with the overall combat state machine.
  warnings: Do not assume all combat state changes are phase transitions. This method
    specifically identifies transitions between distinct combat phases, not general
    combat state updates. Misusing this for regular combat processing can lead to
    incorrect behavior during complex encounters.
