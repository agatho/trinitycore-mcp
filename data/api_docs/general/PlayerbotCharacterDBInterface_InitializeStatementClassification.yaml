  brief: Initializes database statement classification for player bot character data
    operations
  description: This method sets up internal classification structures for database
    statements used in player bot character data management. It prepares the necessary
    SQL statement handles and categorizes them based on their purpose within the playerbot
    system. The initialization ensures that subsequent database operations can efficiently
    route queries to the appropriate prepared statements, improving performance and
    maintainability of character data access patterns. This method is typically called
    during the initialization phase of the playerbot system when establishing database
    connections and preparing for character data operations.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface dbInterface;

      dbInterface.InitializeStatementClassification();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    the playerbot system. It performs setup operations that prepare internal statement
    classification structures and should not be invoked repeatedly. The method assumes
    that database connections are already established and valid.
