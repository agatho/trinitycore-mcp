documentation:
  brief: Decays reputation values for all entries in the social list based on elapsed
    time.
  description: The DecayReputations method reduces the reputation levels of all entries
    within a player's social list over time. This process simulates the natural fading
    of relationships in the game world, where reputations that have not been actively
    maintained or updated will gradually decrease. The decay is applied based on the
    time difference (diff) passed to the function, which typically represents milliseconds
    since last update. This mechanism ensures that players must periodically interact
    with factions or NPCs to maintain their standing, adding depth to character progression
    and social dynamics within Azeroth.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void WorldSession::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n\
      \    _player->GetSocial()->DecayReputations(diff);\n    // ... rest of update\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player update cycles and should be
    invoked regularly to maintain accurate reputation states. The actual decay rate
    and behavior may be influenced by server configuration settings such as reputation
    decay multipliers or time intervals.
