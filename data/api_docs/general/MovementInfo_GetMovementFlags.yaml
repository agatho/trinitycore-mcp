  method: GetMovementFlags
  signature: uint32 MovementInfo::GetMovementFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the movement flags indicating the current movement state of an
    object.
  description: The GetMovementFlags method returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing
    the active movement flags for the object. These flags describe various movement
    states such as walking, running, flying, swimming, or being on a transport. In
    TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, movement flags are essential for synchronizing
    client and server movement data, ensuring accurate character positioning, animation
    states, and physics interactions. The returned value is a bitmask where each bit
    corresponds to a specific movement state or condition.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current movement flags. Each bit in this
    value corresponds to a specific movement state (e.g., MOVEMENTFLAG_WALKING, MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING,
    MOVEMENTFLAG_ONTRANSPORT). The value can be combined using bitwise operations
    to check multiple states simultaneously.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if an object is flying
    code: "if (movementInfo.GetMovementFlags() & MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING)\n{\n    // Object\
      \ is currently flying\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple movement states
    code: "uint32 flags = movementInfo.GetMovementFlags();\nif (flags & MOVEMENTFLAG_ONTRANSPORT\
      \ && flags & MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING)\n{\n    // Object is on a transport and\
      \ swimming\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in movement handling systems to determine how
    an object should be rendered or processed. Movement flags are updated by the server
    based on player actions, NPC behavior, or environmental conditions. The implementation
    relies on internal state tracking within the MovementInfo class.
  warnings: Be aware that movement flags may change frequently during gameplay and
    should not be cached without proper invalidation logic. Always use bitwise operations
    to check specific flag states rather than direct equality comparisons.
