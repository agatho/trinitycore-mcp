documentation:
  brief: Starts a new arena season by updating all relevant game event data and resetting
    player arena statistics.
  description: The StartArenaSeason method initiates a new arena season within the
    TrinityCore server environment. This function is responsible for managing the
    transition between arena seasons, including updating internal game event tracking,
    resetting player arena statistics such as match records and ratings, and ensuring
    that all related systems are synchronized with the new season's parameters. It
    typically gets invoked during scheduled maintenance windows or when a seasonal
    reset is required. The method does not accept any parameters and performs its
    operations internally using the GameEventMgr's internal state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Triggering a new arena season
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->StartArenaSeason();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server maintenance or when it's
    safe to reset player statistics. It may cause temporary disruptions in arena matchmaking
    if invoked mid-season without proper coordination.
  warnings: Invoking this method while players are actively participating in arena
    matches can lead to inconsistent state management and potential data loss for
    ongoing matches. Always ensure the server is in a stable state before calling
    this function.
