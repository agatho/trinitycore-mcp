documentation:
  brief: Resets the idle movement generator state, clearing any active movement or
    animation
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the IdleMovementGenerator,
    typically called when a creature or unit needs to transition back to an idle state.
    This method ensures that any previous movement or animation data is cleared and
    prepares the generator for new idle behavior. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, this is commonly invoked during AI state transitions or when resetting
    NPC behavior after an interrupt or movement interruption. The method does not
    take any parameters and performs internal cleanup of the movement generator's
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Idle Movement Generator
    code: "void ResetIdleMovement() {\n    IdleMovementGenerator* idleGen = new IdleMovementGenerator();\n\
      \    idleGen->Reset(nullptr); // Reset the generator state\n    delete idleGen;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when transitioning
    between movement states. It's important to note that this method does not perform
    any explicit parameter validation since it takes no parameters, but it may interact
    with internal state variables managed by the movement generator.
