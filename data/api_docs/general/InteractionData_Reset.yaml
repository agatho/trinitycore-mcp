documentation:
  brief: Resets the interaction data state to its default values.
  description: The Reset method clears all current interaction data and initializes
    it back to its default state. This is typically used when an interaction needs
    to be restarted or cleared, such as when a player closes an NPC dialog or when
    a quest interaction is terminated. The method ensures that any previous interaction
    state is properly discarded and that the object is ready for new interactions.
    It does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Interaction Data
    code: 'InteractionData data;

      data.Reset(); // Resets the interaction data to default state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initializing a new interaction sequence
    to ensure clean state management. It is commonly used in conjunction with other
    interaction-related methods such as Initialize or SetState.
