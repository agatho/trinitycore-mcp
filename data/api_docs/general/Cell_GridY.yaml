  brief: Returns the Y grid coordinate of the cell within the world grid system
  description: The GridY method retrieves the vertical grid coordinate (Y-axis) of
    a Cell object within TrinityCore's world grid system. This coordinate is used
    internally by the game engine to manage spatial partitioning and object visibility.
    The returned value represents the grid index in the Y direction, which corresponds
    to the cell's position relative to the world's origin point. This method is commonly
    used for spatial queries, object management, and grid-based operations within
    the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the Y grid coordinate of this cell. The value typically
    ranges from 0 to the maximum grid size in the Y direction, depending on the world
    map's dimensions and grid configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Cell* cell = new Cell(x, y);

      int gridY = cell->GridY();

      printf("Cell Y coordinate: %d\n", gridY);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Grid Coordinate Validation
    code: "Cell* cell = GetCellAtPosition(x, y);\nint gridY = cell->GridY();\nif (gridY\
      \ >= 0 && gridY < MAX_GRID_SIZE)\n{\n    // Valid grid coordinate\n    ProcessCellGrid(gridY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns cached grid coordinates. It does
    not perform any calculations or modifications to the cell's state. The grid system
    in TrinityCore uses fixed-size cells, typically 533.33333 yards per cell side,
    which affects how these coordinates map to world positions.
  warnings: The returned value is only meaningful within the context of the current
    world grid system. Using this coordinate outside of proper grid management contexts
    may lead to incorrect spatial queries or invalid memory access if not properly
    validated against valid grid boundaries.
