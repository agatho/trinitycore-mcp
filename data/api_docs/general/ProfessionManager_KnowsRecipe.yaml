documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player knows a specific profession recipe
  description: The KnowsRecipe method determines if a given player character has learned
    a particular profession recipe. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    scripting and game logic to verify recipe ownership before allowing crafting operations
    or displaying recipe information. The method takes a pointer to a player object
    and a recipe identifier, returning true if the recipe is known by the player,
    false otherwise. It relies on the internal recipe tracking system within the player's
    profession data.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose recipe
      knowledge is being checked
  - name: recipeId
    description: Unique identifier for the profession recipe to check. This corresponds
      to the ID found in the game's recipe database
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the player knows the specified recipe.
    Returns true if the recipe is known, false if not known or if the player pointer
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Recipe Check
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nuint32 recipeId = 12345;\
      \ // Example recipe ID\nif (ProfessionManager::KnowsRecipe(player, recipeId))\
      \ {\n    // Player knows this recipe\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You know this\
      \ recipe.\");\n} else {\n    // Player does not know this recipe\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You don't know this recipe.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Crafting Permission Check
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nuint32 blacksmithingRecipe\
      \ = 10940; // Example blacksmithing recipe ID\nif (ProfessionManager::KnowsRecipe(player,\
      \ blacksmithingRecipe)) {\n    // Allow crafting operation\n    DoCrafting(player,\
      \ blacksmithingRecipe);\n} else {\n    // Prevent crafting and send error message\n\
      \    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot craft this item because you don't\
      \ know the recipe.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player object is valid and properly initialized.
    The method likely accesses internal player profession data structures to determine
    recipe knowledge. Performance is generally good as it's a simple lookup operation,
    but repeated calls should be optimized if used in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Ensure the player pointer is not null before calling this method, as dereferencing
    a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. The recipeId must correspond to
    an actual existing recipe in the game database, otherwise the result may be unpredictable
    or cause errors.
