  method: HandleAuraModMinimumSpeedRate
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModMinimumSpeedRate(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the minimum speed rate of the target based on aura application.
  description: The HandleAuraModMinimumSpeedRate method is responsible for adjusting
    the minimum movement speed rate of a unit affected by an aura. This method is
    typically invoked during aura application or removal to modify how fast a unit
    can move at its slowest possible pace. It interacts with the AuraApplication object
    to determine the specific effect parameters and applies changes accordingly. The
    modification affects the target's movement mechanics, particularly in scenarios
    where speed limitations are enforced, such as root effects or movement-debuffing
    abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This contains information about the aura's state and target.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation, typically indicating whether the effect is
      being applied (true) or removed (false). Used internally to control behavior
      during aura activation/deactivation.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag that determines if the speed modification should be
      applied (true) or reverted (false). Controls the direction of the effect change.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Minimum Speed Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 0;

      bool apply = true;

      effect->HandleAuraModMinimumSpeedRate(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Minimum Speed Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 1;

      bool apply = false;

      effect->HandleAuraModMinimumSpeedRate(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the movement speed attributes of a unit. It
    should be used carefully in performance-sensitive contexts as it may trigger recalculations
    of movement-related stats. The implementation likely interacts with the unit's
    speed calculation system to enforce minimum thresholds.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the mode or apply parameters can lead to unexpected
    behavior in unit movement. Ensure that this method is only called during appropriate
    aura application events to avoid inconsistent state changes.
