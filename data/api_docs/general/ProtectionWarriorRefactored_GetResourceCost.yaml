  class: ProtectionWarriorRefactored
  method: GetResourceCost
  signature: uint32 ProtectionWarriorRefactored::GetResourceCost(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the resource cost of a specified spell for the Protection
    Warrior class.
  description: The GetResourceCost method retrieves the resource cost associated with
    executing a given spell ID within the context of the Protection Warrior's gameplay
    mechanics. This method is typically used to determine whether a player has sufficient
    resources (such as rage, energy, or mana) to cast a specific ability. The calculation
    may consider various factors including spell properties, class-specific modifiers,
    and current player state. It serves as a core component in spell validation and
    resource management systems for Protection Warriors.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to calculate the resource
      cost. This ID must correspond to a valid spell defined in the game's spell database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the resource cost required to cast
    the specified spell. A return value of zero typically indicates that no resource
    is consumed or that the spell does not require any resource expenditure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 cost = warrior->GetResourceCost(100); // Get cost for spell ID 100\n\
      if (cost > 0)\n{\n    // Check if player has enough resources\n    if (player->GetPower(POWER_RAGE)\
      \ >= cost)\n        warrior->CastSpell(target, 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Cost Validation
    code: "uint32 spellId = 7386; // Shield Slam\nuint32 requiredCost = warrior->GetResourceCost(spellId);\n\
      if (requiredCost > 0 && player->GetPower(POWER_RAGE) >= requiredCost)\n{\n \
      \   // Proceed with casting the spell\n    warrior->CastSpell(target, spellId);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle insufficient resource condition\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Not enough rage to cast this ability.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal spell data structures and may
    cache results for performance optimization. Developers should be aware that the
    returned value might vary based on active buffs, talents, or gear modifications
    that affect resource costs.
  warnings: "Ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to a valid spell in the\
    \ game's database; invalid IDs could result in undefined behavior or incorrect\
    \ cost calculations. Also, note that this method does not perform actual resource\
    \ deduction\u2014it only returns the calculated cost for validation purposes."
