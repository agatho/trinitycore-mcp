    const
documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to a packet for transmission to clients.
  description: The Append method is responsible for adding channel-related notification
    information to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore server's channel management system to prepare and
    format notifications that are sent to players when channel events occur, such
    as joining, leaving, or receiving messages in channels. The method operates on
    a const object, indicating it does not modify the BannedAppend instance itself
    but rather prepares data for transmission. It is part of the internal packet building
    process for channel communications.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet object
      that will be populated with channel notification data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Channel Event Handling
    code: 'BannedAppend bannedAppend;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      bannedAppend.Append(notifyPacket);

      // The notifyPacket is now populated with channel data ready for sending to
      clients.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server's channel subsystem
    during channel event processing. It assumes that the provided packet object is
    properly initialized and ready to receive data. The method does not perform any
    validation on the input packet, so it should be used with care in contexts where
    packet integrity is important.
