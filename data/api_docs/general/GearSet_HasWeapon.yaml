  signature: bool GearSet::HasWeapon() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the gear set contains a weapon.
  description: The HasWeapon method checks if the current GearSet instance includes
    any weapon equipment. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to evaluate whether a player's equipped items contain a weapon, which
    can be important for determining valid combat states, spell requirements, or gear
    validation logic. The method performs a simple check on the internal weapon slot(s)
    within the gear set and returns true if at least one weapon is present, false
    otherwise. This functionality is commonly used in combat-related systems where
    weapon presence affects gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the gear set contains at least one weapon item; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (gearSet.HasWeapon()) {\n    // Player has a weapon equipped\n    SendCombatMessage(\"\
      You are ready for battle!\");\n} else {\n    // No weapon equipped\n    SendCombatMessage(\"\
      Equip a weapon to fight!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat System
    code: "void Player::UpdateCombatState() {\n    if (HasWeapon()) {\n        SetCombatReady(true);\n\
      \        StartCombatTimer();\n    } else {\n        SetCombatReady(false);\n\
      \        CancelCombatTimer();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only checks for the presence of weapons in the gear set and does
    not validate weapon type, damage, or other attributes. It's a simple boolean check
    that can be used as part of larger validation logic in combat systems.
