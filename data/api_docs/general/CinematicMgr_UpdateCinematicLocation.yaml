  method: UpdateCinematicLocation
  signature: void CinematicMgr::UpdateCinematicLocation(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cinematic location state based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateCinematicLocation method is responsible for managing the
    progression of cinematic sequences within the game world. It processes the time
    delta passed as a parameter to determine if any cinematic events should advance
    or conclude. This method is typically called from the main game loop and ensures
    that cinematic sequences are properly synchronized with the game's timing system.
    The method handles internal state management for active cinematics, including
    updating positions, triggering events, and cleaning up finished sequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update all systems including\
      \ cinematics\n    _cinematicMgr->UpdateCinematicLocation(diff);\n    // Other\
      \ update logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from the main game thread. It is designed
    to be invoked once per game tick with the time delta (in milliseconds) since the
    last call. The implementation internally manages a list of active cinematic sequences
    and updates their states accordingly.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from other threads without proper synchronization.
    Improper usage may lead to race conditions or inconsistent cinematic behavior
    in the game world.
