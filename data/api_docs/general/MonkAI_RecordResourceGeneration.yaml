  class: MonkAI
  method: RecordResourceGeneration
  signature: void MonkAI::RecordResourceGeneration(int chi, int energy)
documentation:
  brief: Records the generation of chi and energy resources for a Monk AI.
  description: The RecordResourceGeneration method is used to track and store the
    amount of chi and energy generated by a Monk AI during gameplay. This method likely
    updates internal state variables or logs resource changes for the purpose of AI
    decision-making, performance tracking, or synchronization with game mechanics.
    It is typically called when a Monk character performs actions that produce these
    resources, such as using abilities like Tiger Palm, Blackout Kick, or other chi-generating
    moves. The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of
    the MonkAI instance to reflect the latest resource generation values.
  parameters:
  - name: chi
    description: The amount of chi generated during the action. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing the quantity of chi produced.
  - name: energy
    description: The amount of energy generated during the action. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing the quantity of energy produced.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MonkAI ai;

      ai.RecordResourceGeneration(1, 0); // Records 1 chi generated

      ai.RecordResourceGeneration(0, 5); // Records 5 energy generated'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combined Resource Generation
    code: 'MonkAI ai;

      int chiGenerated = 2;

      int energyGenerated = 3;

      ai.RecordResourceGeneration(chiGenerated, energyGenerated); // Records both
      chi and energy'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI system in TrinityCore and likely interacts
    with internal resource tracking systems. It may be used for balancing AI behavior
    or logging resource generation events for debugging purposes.
