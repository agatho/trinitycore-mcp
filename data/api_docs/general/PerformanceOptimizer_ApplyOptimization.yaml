  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: ApplyOptimization
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::ApplyOptimization(BotAI * ai, const OptimizationStrategy
    & strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a specified optimization strategy to a BotAI instance to enhance
    performance.
  description: The ApplyOptimization method configures and activates a given optimization
    strategy on a BotAI object, adjusting its behavior and resource usage patterns
    to improve overall performance. This method is typically used in TrinityCore's
    AI framework to fine-tune bot behavior for better efficiency under various game
    conditions. The optimization strategy defines how the AI should prioritize actions,
    manage resources, and respond to stimuli. It is expected that this method be called
    during initialization or when switching between different performance modes of
    the bot.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will receive the optimization
      strategy. Must not be null.
  - name: strategy
    description: Reference to an OptimizationStrategy object defining how the AI should
      be optimized. The strategy includes parameters such as action priority, resource
      allocation, and decision-making thresholds.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ApplyOptimization
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      BotAI* bot = new BotAI();

      OptimizationStrategy strategy;

      strategy.SetActionPriority(ActionType::ATTACK, 10);

      strategy.SetResourceThreshold(ResourceType::MANA, 30);

      optimizer.ApplyOptimization(bot, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the BotAI object directly. Ensure
    that the provided BotAI instance is properly initialized before calling this function.
    The optimization strategy should be carefully designed to avoid conflicts with
    existing AI logic.
  warnings: Calling ApplyOptimization on a null BotAI pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Always validate input parameters before invoking this method. Improperly
    configured strategies may lead to suboptimal or erratic bot behavior.
