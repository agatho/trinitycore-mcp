  class: Battleground
  method: GetMinPlayersPerTeam
  signature: int Battleground::GetMinPlayersPerTeam() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum number of players required per team in the battleground.
  description: The GetMinPlayersPerTeam method retrieves the minimum player count
    needed for a battleground to begin. This value is typically defined by the battleground's
    type and configuration, ensuring that matches can start with sufficient participation.
    The returned value represents how many players must be present on each team for
    the battleground to be considered valid for gameplay. This method is commonly
    used during battleground initialization and matchmaking processes to validate
    player counts before allowing a match to commence.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the minimum number of players required per team
    in the battleground. A value of 0 typically indicates that no minimum is enforced,
    while positive values indicate the exact count needed for each team.
  examples:
  - title: Check Minimum Players Required
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    int minPlayers = bg->GetMinPlayersPerTeam();\n    if (minPlayers > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // Ensure at least minPlayers are present per team\n       \
      \ sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_MINPLAYERS, minPlayers);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground initialization and player
    join validation. It's important to note that the actual number of players in a
    battleground may exceed this minimum due to server population or matchmaking settings.
