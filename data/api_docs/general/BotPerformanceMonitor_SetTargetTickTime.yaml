  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::SetTargetTickTime(uint32 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target tick time for bot performance monitoring in microseconds
  description: Configures the target tick time that the BotPerformanceMonitor uses
    to track and evaluate bot behavior efficiency. This value determines the expected
    duration for each monitoring cycle, allowing the system to identify when bots
    are performing above or below acceptable thresholds. The method updates an internal
    timer that is used by performance analysis routines to calculate bot responsiveness
    and resource utilization. This setting directly impacts how the monitoring system
    interprets performance data and generates alerts or reports based on deviations
    from the specified target.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The target tick time in microseconds that bots should aim to complete
      their monitoring cycle within. Valid values are typically in the range of 1000-1000000
      microseconds (1ms to 1s). Values outside this range may cause performance issues
      or invalid monitoring results.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Default Target Tick Time
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.SetTargetTickTime(50000); // Set target to 50ms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring High-Performance Target
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.SetTargetTickTime(10000); // Set aggressive 10ms target for high-performance
      bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or configuration
    phases. The target tick time affects how the monitoring system calculates performance
    metrics and should be set based on expected bot complexity and server load conditions.
  warnings: Setting extremely low target values may cause false positive performance
    alerts, while excessively high values may mask actual performance issues. Ensure
    that the target tick time reflects realistic expectations for bot behavior under
    normal server conditions.
