documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of honorable kills recorded for a battleground player
  description: The GetHonorableKills method retrieves the count of honorable kills
    associated with a specific battleground player. In World of Warcraft's battleground
    system, honorable kills are awarded when a player successfully defeats an opponent
    using standard combat mechanics without exploiting game rules or mechanics. This
    value is typically tracked and updated during battleground sessions, contributing
    to the player's overall battleground statistics and reputation rewards. The method
    provides read-only access to this statistic and does not modify any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of honorable kills achieved by
    the player in the current battleground session. Returns zero if no honorable kills
    have been recorded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();

      int honorableKills = score->GetHonorableKills();

      printf("Player has %d honorable kills\n", honorableKills);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Victory Condition Check
    code: "BattlegroundScore* score = player->GetBattlegroundScore();\nint honorableKills\
      \ = score->GetHonorableKills();\nif (honorableKills >= 5)\n{\n    // Award bonus\
      \ for high honorable kill count\n    player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_BONUS_REWARD, 1);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground scoring system and should only be
    called during active battleground sessions. The returned value reflects kills
    made against opponents who were also in valid battleground participation status.
  warnings: Do not assume that this value will persist across different battleground
    instances or sessions. Always verify that the player is currently in a battleground
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
