  signature: void PerformanceTimer::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the performance timer to its initial state, clearing any previously
    recorded time measurements.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes a PerformanceTimer object,
    effectively clearing any accumulated time data and preparing it for new timing
    measurements. This method is typically used when starting a new timing session
    or when resetting an existing timer to zero. The timer's internal state is reset
    but does not affect other timer instances or global timing systems. It is commonly
    used in performance profiling, benchmarking, and game logic timing operations
    where precise measurement intervals are required.

  - title: Basic Timer Reset Usage
    code: 'PerformanceTimer timer;

      timer.Start();

      // ... some code execution ...

      timer.Reset(); // Resets the timer to zero state

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset in Performance Profiling Loop
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {\n    PerformanceTimer profiler;\n    profiler.Start();\n\
      \    // Execute some function\n    profiler.Stop();\n    // Log timing result\n\
      \    profiler.Reset(); // Prepare for next iteration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Reset method does not stop a running timer; if called while the timer
    is actively measuring time, it will reset the accumulated time to zero but leave
    the timer in its current state (running or stopped). This behavior ensures that
    timing sessions can be properly managed without unintended side effects.
