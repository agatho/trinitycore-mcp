documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat reference state when the target is offline.
  description: The UpdateOffline method is responsible for handling the update of
    threat references when a creature or player target is no longer in an online state.
    This typically occurs during combat scenarios where the target has either logged
    out, become disconnected, or otherwise transitioned from an active to an inactive
    state. The method ensures that the threat table and related tracking mechanisms
    are properly adjusted to reflect the offline status of the target. This is particularly
    important for maintaining accurate threat levels in group encounters and preventing
    stale references from affecting combat mechanics.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Context
    code: "void HandleCombatUpdate(ThreatReference* threatRef)\n{\n    if (threatRef->IsTargetOffline())\n\
      \        threatRef->UpdateOffline();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a target is confirmed to be offline.
    It's typically invoked internally by the threat manager system rather than directly
    by external code. The method may trigger cleanup operations for threat tracking
    data associated with the offline target.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already offline reference may cause undefined
    behavior or duplicate processing. Ensure proper state checking before invocation.
