documentation:
  brief: Generates a smooth navigation path between two points using polygonal waypoints.
  description: The FindSmoothPath method computes a smoothed navigation path from
    a starting position to an ending position, utilizing a provided polygonal path
    as input. It takes in the start and end coordinates along with a sequence of polygonal
    waypoints (polyPath) and returns a refined smooth path that can be used for character
    movement in the game world. This function is typically used by AI systems or pathfinding
    modules to ensure characters follow natural, non-stuttering movement trajectories
    rather than rigid straight lines between waypoints. The method requires proper
    initialization of the PathGenerator instance and valid input parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: startPos
    description: Pointer to an array containing the X and Y coordinates of the starting
      position (float[2]).
  - name: endPos
    description: Pointer to an array containing the X and Y coordinates of the ending
      position (float[2]).
  - name: polyPath
    description: Pointer to an array of polygon indices representing a path through
      navigation polygons.
  - name: polyPathSize
    description: Integer indicating the number of elements in the polyPath array.
  - name: smoothPath
    description: Pointer to a buffer where the resulting smooth path coordinates will
      be stored (float[2 * maxSmoothPathSize]).
  - name: smoothPathSize
    description: Pointer to an integer that will receive the number of points in the
      generated smooth path.
  - name: maxSmoothPathSize
    description: Maximum number of points the smoothPath buffer can hold (must be
      at least 2).
  returns: An integer representing the status of the operation. Returns 0 on success,
    negative values indicate errors such as invalid input parameters or insufficient
    buffer size.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    float startPos[2] = {10.0f, 20.0f};\n\
      \    float endPos[2] = {50.0f, 60.0f};\n    int polyPath[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};\n\
      \    int polyPathSize = 4;\n    float smoothPath[100];\n    int smoothPathSize\
      \ = 0;\n    int maxSmoothPathSize = 50;\n\n    PathGenerator pathGen;\n    int\
      \ result = pathGen.FindSmoothPath(startPos, endPos, polyPath, polyPathSize,\
      \ smoothPath, &smoothPathSize, maxSmoothPathSize);\n\n    if (result == 0) {\n\
      \        std::cout << \"Smooth path generated with \" << smoothPathSize << \"\
      \ points.\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Error generating\
      \ smooth path: \" << result << std::endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the PathGenerator instance has been properly initialized
    with valid navigation data. The polyPath should represent a valid sequence of
    connected polygons in the navigation mesh. The smoothPath buffer must be large
    enough to accommodate the expected number of output points.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for startPos, endPos, or polyPath will likely cause
    crashes. Ensure that maxSmoothPathSize is sufficient to avoid buffer overflows.
    The method may fail if the polygonal path does not lead from start to end positions
    correctly.
