  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildBankDepositMoney(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildBankDepositMoney&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Method implementation handles the deposit logic\n    //\
      \ Validates player permissions and guild bank status\n    // Updates guild gold\
      \ balance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player interacts with the guild bank
    interface and selects to deposit money. It requires the player to be in a guild
    with active bank permissions. The method performs internal validation checks for
    gold amount limits and player's current gold balance.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method could lead to gold duplication exploits
    or unauthorized guild fund access. Ensure proper permission checks are enforced
    before allowing any gold transactions.
