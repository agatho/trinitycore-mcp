  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotPriorityManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot priority management system, setting up internal data
    structures and loading configuration settings.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotPriorityManager for operation
    by constructing necessary internal data structures, loading configuration parameters
    from the database or configuration files, and validating that all required dependencies
    are present. This method is typically called during server startup or when the
    bot system is first enabled. It ensures that priority rules and scheduling mechanisms
    are properly configured before any bot-related operations begin. The initialization
    process may involve reading from the 'bot_priority' table in the database and
    setting up internal caches for fast lookup of priority configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization completed successfully and all required
    components were properly set up; returns false if initialization failed due to
    missing dependencies, configuration errors, or other critical issues that prevent
    the system from operating correctly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "BotPriorityManager* manager = new BotPriorityManager();\nif (manager->Initialize())\
      \ {\n    // Initialization successful\n    printf(\"Bot priority manager initialized\
      \ successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Initialization failed\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to initialize bot priority manager.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the system's lifecycle, typically
    at server startup or when enabling the bot subsystem. Repeated calls may result
    in undefined behavior or resource leaks if not properly handled by the implementation.
    The method is expected to be thread-safe as it's usually invoked during single-threaded
    initialization phases.
  warnings: Do not call this method after the bot system has already been initialized,
    as doing so might cause data corruption or inconsistent state. Ensure that all
    required database tables and configuration entries exist before calling Initialize
    to avoid silent failures or incomplete setups.
