documentation:
  brief: Manages advanced Windwalker monk AI behavior including talent optimizations
    and combat rotation decisions.
  description: The HandleAdvancedWindwalkerManagement method implements sophisticated
    decision-making logic for Windwalker monks within the TrinityCore AI framework.
    This method evaluates the current combat state, player buffs/debuffs, resource
    levels, and talent configurations to determine optimal actions such as applying
    damage-over-time effects, managing chi generation, executing combo point builds,
    and coordinating with other abilities like Tiger Palm and Blackout Kick. It integrates
    with the broader MonkAI system to ensure that Windwalker monks follow advanced
    rotation strategies while maintaining proper resource management and cooldown
    tracking. The method is typically called during AI update cycles when the monk
    needs to make tactical decisions in combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    HandleAdvancedWindwalkerManagement();\n    // ... rest of update logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "void MonkAI::HandleAdvancedWindwalkerManagement()\n{\n    if (!me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Evaluate current combat situation\n    if (me->GetPower(POWER_CHI)\
      \ >= 5)\n    {\n        // Execute advanced rotation logic\n        DoExecuteWindwalkerRotation();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Manage resource generation\n        DoManageChiGeneration();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the AI has access to full player state information including
    buffs, debuffs, power levels, and cooldowns. It requires proper initialization
    of the MonkAI context before being called. The implementation may vary based on
    the specific version of TrinityCore and the monk's talent build.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper AI context initialization can
    lead to incorrect behavior or crashes. This method should only be called when
    the monk is in a valid combat state with proper target selection. Avoid calling
    it during teleportation or other non-combat transitions.
