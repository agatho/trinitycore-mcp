documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BlackMarketMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BlackMarketMgr class is responsible for cleaning
    up all dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the black market manager.
    This includes removing any active black market auctions, clearing internal data
    structures, and ensuring that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur when
    the manager is destroyed. The destructor is automatically invoked when a BlackMarketMgr
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource
    management for the black market system within the TrinityCore server.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BlackMarketMgr instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BlackMarketMgr* mgr = new BlackMarketMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor is called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It's important to ensure that all auction data is properly saved or
    discarded before destruction occurs, as this may affect player data persistence
    in the black market system.
