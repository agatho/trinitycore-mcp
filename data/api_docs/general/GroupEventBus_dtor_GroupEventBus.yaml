  signature: void GroupEventBus::~GroupEventBus()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the GroupEventBus instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~GroupEventBus destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all resources allocated by the GroupEventBus object. This includes unregistering
    any event listeners, releasing memory held by internal data structures, and ensuring
    no dangling references remain. The destructor is automatically invoked when a
    GroupEventBus object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that
    the event bus system does not leave behind any active subscriptions or memory
    leaks that could affect performance or stability in the TrinityCore server environment.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of GroupEventBus
    code: "void CleanupGroupEventBus() {\n    GroupEventBus* eventBus = new GroupEventBus();\n\
      \    // ... use the event bus ...\n    delete eventBus; // Triggers ~GroupEventBus()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor ensures thread safety by properly synchronizing access to
    shared resources during cleanup. It is recommended to avoid calling this destructor
    directly unless managing object lifecycle manually, as it's typically invoked
    automatically by the C++ runtime when objects go out of scope.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor manually on stack-allocated GroupEventBus
    objects; let the compiler handle automatic destruction. Avoid using raw pointers
    without proper ownership semantics to prevent double deletion or memory corruption
    issues.
