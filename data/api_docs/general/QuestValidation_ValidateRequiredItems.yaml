api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateRequiredItems
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateRequiredItems(uint32 questId, Player *
    bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player has all required items for a specified quest.
  description: The ValidateRequiredItems method checks if the given player character
    possesses all the necessary items required to start or progress through a specific
    quest. This validation typically occurs when a player attempts to interact with
    a quest giver or accept a quest. The method verifies item quantities, types, and
    any other requirements defined in the quest's data. It returns true if all required
    items are present and meet the criteria, otherwise false. This functionality is
    crucial for maintaining game integrity by ensuring players cannot bypass quest
    prerequisites through item manipulation or cheating.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate item requirements
      for. Must correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose inventory
      is being checked. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if all required items are present in the player's inventory
    and meet the quest requirements; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Item Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateRequiredItems(12345, player)) {\n    // Player\
      \ has all required items\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Player is missing required items\n    player->SendNotification(\"You do not\
      \ have the required items.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void HandleQuestAccept(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    if (QuestValidation::ValidateRequiredItems(questId,\
      \ player)) {\n        // Proceed with quest acceptance logic\n        player->AddQuest(questId);\n\
      \        player->SendQuestComplete(questId);\n    } else {\n        // Prevent\
      \ quest acceptance and inform player\n        player->SendNotification(\"You\
      \ cannot accept this quest without the required items.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest data tables and player inventory systems.
    It may perform database lookups for quest item requirements, so frequent calls
    could impact performance. The validation considers item counts, quality levels,
    and any special flags or conditions associated with required items.
  warnings: Ensure the player pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    null pointer dereferences. The method does not modify the player's inventory or
    quest state; it only performs read-only validation checks.
