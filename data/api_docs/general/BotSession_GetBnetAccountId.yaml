  class: BotSession
  method: GetBnetAccountId
  signature: uint32 BotSession::GetBnetAccountId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Battle.net account identifier associated with this bot session.
  description: The GetBnetAccountId method returns the unique identifier (ID) of the
    Battle.net account that is linked to the current bot session. This ID is used
    internally by TrinityCore to manage authentication and account-related data for
    bot characters. The method does not perform any network requests or external lookups;
    it simply returns a cached value stored within the BotSession object. It is typically
    called during session initialization or when verifying account ownership for specific
    game operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the Battle.net account ID. If no
    valid account is associated with the bot session, this value may be zero or undefined
    depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 accountId = botSession->GetBnetAccountId();\nif (accountId != 0)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"Bot is linked to Battle.net account ID: %u\\n\", accountId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Account Verification
    code: "uint32 accountId = botSession->GetBnetAccountId();\nPlayer* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayerByLowGUID(accountId);\n\
      if (player)\n{\n    // Proceed with account-specific operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotSession has already been initialized with
    a valid Battle.net account reference. The returned value is typically set during
    the session creation process and should remain constant throughout the lifetime
    of the session.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid BotSession may return
    unexpected values such as zero. Ensure proper initialization before invoking this
    function to avoid incorrect behavior.
