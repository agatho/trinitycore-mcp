  class: GuildBankManager
  method: LoadGuildBankData
  signature: void GuildBankManager::LoadGuildBankData(uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads all guild bank data for the specified guild identifier.
  description: The LoadGuildBankData method retrieves and initializes all stored guild
    bank information for a given guild, including item entries, tab configurations,
    and access permissions. This method is typically invoked during guild initialization
    or when a player joins a guild to ensure that the guild's bank state is accurately
    reflected in memory. It interacts with the database to fetch data related to items
    stored in the guild bank, tab layouts, and permissions for each guild member.
    The method does not return any value but updates internal data structures within
    the GuildBankManager class.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild whose bank data is to be loaded.
      Must correspond to a valid guild in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.LoadGuildBankData(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Guild Initialization Context
    code: "void OnGuildLoaded(uint32 guildId)\n{\n    GuildBankManager bankManager;\n\
      \    bankManager.LoadGuildBankData(guildId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the guild exists. It performs a database query to load all relevant guild
    bank data, which may impact performance if the guild has a large number of items
    in its bank.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the guild exists or that the
    database connection is valid can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure
    that the guild ID passed is valid before invoking this method.
