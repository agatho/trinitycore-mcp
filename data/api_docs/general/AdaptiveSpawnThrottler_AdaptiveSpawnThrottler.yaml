  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  signature: void AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::AdaptiveSpawnThrottler()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler class for managing
    dynamic spawn rate adjustments in World of Warcraft.
  description: The AdaptiveSpawnThrottler constructor initializes a new instance of
    the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler class, which is responsible for dynamically adjusting
    spawn rates of creatures and game objects based on server load, player activity,
    and other environmental factors. This mechanism helps maintain optimal performance
    by preventing excessive resource consumption during high-traffic periods while
    ensuring adequate content availability. The throttler typically monitors system
    resources, active players, and spawn point utilization to make intelligent decisions
    about when and how frequently to spawn entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AdaptiveSpawnThrottler instance
    code: 'AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;

      // The constructor is called automatically during object creation

      // This initializes the throttling logic for managing spawn rates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is typically instantiated and managed by the TrinityCore server's
    spawn management system. Developers should not directly call this constructor
    unless implementing custom spawn behavior. The adaptive throttling algorithm may
    adjust based on configuration settings in the worldserver.conf file.
  warnings: Do not instantiate multiple AdaptiveSpawnThrottler objects for the same
    area, as this could lead to inconsistent spawn rate calculations. The class is
    designed to be a singleton or managed centrally by the server's spawn system.
