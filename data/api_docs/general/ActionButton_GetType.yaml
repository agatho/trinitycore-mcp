  class: ActionButton
  method: GetType
  signature: ActionButtonType ActionButton::GetType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the type identifier of the action button.
  description: The GetType method returns the ActionButtonType enumeration value that
    represents the type of action this button is configured to perform. This enumeration
    typically indicates whether the button is bound to a spell, item, macro, or other
    game action types. The returned value helps determine how the button should be
    interpreted and executed within the game's user interface and action handling
    systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ActionButtonType enumeration value indicating the type of action this
    button represents. Possible values may include ACTION_BUTTON_SPELL, ACTION_BUTTON_ITEM,
    ACTION_BUTTON_MACRO, or other related types depending on the button's configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Check Button Type
    code: "ActionButton* button = player->GetActionButton(1);\nActionButtonType type\
      \ = button->GetType();\nif (type == ACTION_BUTTON_SPELL)\n{\n    // Handle spell\
      \ action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in UI logic to determine how to display or handle
    different types of action buttons. The returned value directly corresponds to
    the button's configuration and should not be modified through this accessor.
