documentation:
  brief: Returns the reputation price discount for a given faction template
  description: This method calculates and returns the reputation price discount that
    applies to a specific faction template. It is used to determine how much of a
    discount the player receives when purchasing items or services related to that
    faction. The discount value is typically based on the player's current reputation
    level with the faction, and may be influenced by various factors including player's
    level, faction standing, and any applicable modifiers. This method is essential
    for determining pricing in reputation-based transactions within the game.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the discount applied to reputation prices
    for the specified faction template. The value typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0,
    where 0.0 indicates no discount and 1.0 indicates maximum discount. Values may
    be negative in certain edge cases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float discount = player->GetReputationPriceDiscount(factionTemplate);\n\
      if (discount > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Apply discount to reputation price\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal player reputation data and faction template
    information to compute the discount value. Performance considerations include
    potential caching of results for frequently accessed factions. Thread safety is
    not an issue as this is a const method that does not modify any state.
  warnings: This method may return unexpected values if the faction template is invalid
    or if the player's reputation level is not properly initialized. Be cautious when
    using this in contexts where reputation levels are changing rapidly.
