  brief: Uses available offensive cooldowns for the Mage AI.
  description: The UseOffensiveCooldowns method is responsible for executing offensive
    abilities that are currently off cooldown for a Mage AI character. This method
    evaluates the Mage's current spell cooldowns and selects appropriate offensive
    spells to cast based on game state, target conditions, and AI logic. It typically
    integrates with the broader MageAI system to ensure optimal usage of powerful
    abilities like Fireball, Frostbolt, or other offensive spells within the constraints
    of the combat scenario.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked after checking for valid targets and combat readiness. It assumes that
    the MageAI instance has access to a valid target and sufficient mana to cast offensive
    spells.
