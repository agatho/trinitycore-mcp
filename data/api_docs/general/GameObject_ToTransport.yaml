documentation:
  brief: Returns the transport object that the game object is attached to.
  description: The ToTransport method retrieves the Transport object that a GameObject
    is currently attached to, if any. This method is commonly used in the context
    of game objects that are part of a transport system, such as boats or elevators,
    where the object's position is tied to the transport's movement. It allows developers
    to access the transport data for further processing or to determine if the object
    is currently on a transport. The method returns nullptr if the GameObject is not
    attached to any transport.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Transport object that the GameObject is attached
    to, or nullptr if the GameObject is not currently attached to any transport.
