  brief: Stops and cleans up the AI decision profiling system
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the AI decision profiling functionality
    within the AIDecisionProfiler class. This method ensures that all active profiling
    sessions are properly closed, resources are released, and any accumulated profiling
    data is flushed or saved as needed. It typically gets called during server shutdown
    or when the profiling system needs to be temporarily disabled. The method performs
    necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper state management
    of the profiling subsystem.

    code: AIDecisionProfiler::Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI decision profiling system is
    no longer needed or during server shutdown. Calling this method while profiling
    sessions are active may result in loss of profiling data. The method is typically
    invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework during server lifecycle management.
