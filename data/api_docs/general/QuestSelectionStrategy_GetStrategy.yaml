  brief: Retrieves the current quest selection strategy used by the AI.
  description: The GetStrategy method returns the active Strategy enum value that
    defines how the AI selects quests for a player or NPC. This strategy determines
    the logic and priority used when choosing which quests to offer or pursue. The
    returned strategy may influence quest availability, progression, and interaction
    behavior within the game world. This method is typically called during AI decision-making
    processes to ensure consistent quest selection behavior based on configured settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Strategy enum value indicating the current quest selection approach being
    used by the AI system. Possible values may include different priority levels or
    selection criteria such as 'Random', 'Priority', or 'QuestLine'.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Strategy currentStrategy = questSelectionStrategy.GetStrategy();\nif (currentStrategy\

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context where AI quest
    selection logic is required. The returned strategy value may change dynamically
    based on configuration settings or game state.
