  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: GetCurrentStockpile
  signature: uint32 ProfessionAuctionBridge::GetCurrentStockpile(int * player, uint32
    itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stockpile quantity of a specified item for a player
    in the profession auction system.
  description: The GetCurrentStockpile method returns the total quantity of a specific
    item that is currently held in stock by a player within the profession auction
    bridge system. This value represents the accumulated inventory of the item across
    all auction house transactions and player crafting activities related to that
    particular item. The method takes a pointer to a player identifier and an item
    ID as inputs, and returns the current stockpile count. It's commonly used to determine
    how much of a resource or crafted item is available for auction or further processing
    within the game's economy system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter must point to a valid player ID, otherwise behavior is
      undefined.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the item for which to retrieve the stockpile
      quantity. Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total current stockpile quantity
    of the specified item for the given player. A return value of zero indicates no
    stockpile exists for that item, or an error occurred during retrieval.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 stockpile = bridge.GetCurrentStockpile(&playerGuid, 12345);\nif\
      \ (stockpile > 0) {\n    printf(\"Player has %u units of item 12345 in stockpile\\\
      n\", stockpile);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No stockpile found for item 12345\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Inventory Check with Error Handling
    code: "int playerGuid = 98765;\nuint32 itemId = 54321;\nuint32 stockpile = bridge.GetCurrentStockpile(&playerGuid,\
      \ itemId);\n\nif (stockpile == 0) {\n    // Item might not exist or have no\
      \ stockpile\n    printf(\"No stockpile found for item %u\\n\", itemId);\n} else\
      \ if (stockpile == UINT32_MAX) {\n    // Error condition - invalid player or\
      \ item\n    printf(\"Error retrieving stockpile for item %u\\n\", itemId);\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Stockpile: %u units\\n\", stockpile);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the profession auction bridge system and likely interacts
    with internal game databases or caches to track player inventory. It may be called
    frequently during auction house operations, so performance considerations should
    be taken into account when using it in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: The 'player' parameter must point to a valid player GUID; passing an invalid
    pointer or null will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, if the item ID
    does not exist in the game's item database, the method may return unexpected values
    or cause errors.
