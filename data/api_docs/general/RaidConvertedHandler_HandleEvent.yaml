  class: RaidConvertedHandler
  method: HandleEvent
  signature: bool RaidConvertedHandler::HandleEvent(const GroupEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles group events related to raid conversions in the World
    of Warcraft TrinityCore server.
  description: The HandleEvent method is responsible for processing incoming group
    events that are related to raid conversion mechanics within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically handles events such as when a player joins or leaves a raid,
    when a group is converted into a raid, or when raid-specific settings are updated.
    The method evaluates the event type and performs appropriate actions based on
    the current state of the group and raid system. It ensures that all raid-related
    game mechanics are properly maintained and synchronized across the server.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The GroupEvent object containing information about the group event
      that occurred, including event type, affected players, and group state changes.
  returns: Returns true if the event was successfully processed and handled, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate an error in processing or an unsupported
    event type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Handling
    code: "RaidConvertedHandler handler;\nGroupEvent event;\nevent.type = GroupEventType::RAID_CONVERTED;\n\
      event.groupId = 12345;\nbool result = handler.HandleEvent(event);\nif (result)\
      \ {\n    // Event processed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event Processing with Error Handling
    code: "RaidConvertedHandler handler;\nGroupEvent event;\nevent.type = GroupEventType::GROUP_DISBANDED;\n\
      event.groupId = 67890;\n\nif (!handler.HandleEvent(event)) {\n    // Log error\
      \ or handle failed event processing\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to process\
      \ group event for group %u\", event.groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core raid management system and should be called
    whenever a group-related event occurs. The method assumes that the GroupEvent
    object has been properly initialized with valid data before being passed to it.
    It's important to note that this handler may modify group state information and
    should be used in contexts where such modifications are acceptable.
  warnings: Improper handling of GroupEvent objects can lead to inconsistent raid
    states or unexpected behavior in the game world. Ensure that all event data is
    validated before passing it to this method. This method should not be called from
    within critical sections where race conditions might occur.
