  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: TeleportToLeader
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::TeleportToLeader(Player * bot, Player * leader)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports a bot player to the location of their leader player.
  description: The TeleportToLeader method attempts to teleport a specified bot player
    to the current location of their leader player. This functionality is typically
    used in AI behavior systems where bots need to follow their leaders within the
    game world. The method performs the teleportation operation and returns a boolean
    value indicating success or failure of the action. It may involve checking if
    both players are in the same map, verifying that the teleportation is allowed
    by game rules, and ensuring the leader player is valid and accessible.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be teleported.
      Must not be null.
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the leader to whom the
      bot will be teleported. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the teleportation was successful, false otherwise. Failure
    can occur due to invalid player pointers, players being on different maps, or
    other game restrictions preventing teleportation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of TeleportToLeader
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Bot player instance\nPlayer* leader = ...; // Leader\
      \ player instance\nbool success = behavior->TeleportToLeader(bot, leader);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Teleportation succeeded\n} else {\n    // Teleportation\
      \ failed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with error handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nPlayer* leader = ...;\nif (bot && leader) {\n    bool\
      \ result = behavior->TeleportToLeader(bot, leader);\n    if (!result) {\n  \
      \      // Handle teleportation failure\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed to teleport\
      \ bot %u to leader %u\", bot->GetGUID().GetCounter(), leader->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    }\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid player pointers provided\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LeaderFollowBehavior AI system and assumes that
    both players are valid instances within the game world. The implementation likely
    checks for map compatibility, player state (e.g., if they're dead or in combat),
    and other game-specific constraints before performing the teleportation.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and leader pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid crashes. Be aware that frequent use of teleportation may impact
    performance or be restricted by server settings. Also, teleporting players during
    combat or in certain zones might not be allowed by game rules.
