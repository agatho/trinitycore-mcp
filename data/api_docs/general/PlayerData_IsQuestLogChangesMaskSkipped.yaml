documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's quest log changes mask is currently skipped.
  description: This method checks if the quest log changes mask for the player is
    being skipped, which typically occurs during specific game events or transitions
    where quest updates should not be processed. The mask skipping mechanism is used
    to prevent unnecessary or conflicting quest state updates during critical gameplay
    moments such as zone changes, teleportations, or loading sequences. This can affect
    how quest progress is tracked and reported to the client.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest log changes mask is currently skipped; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Quest Log Changes are Skipped
    code: "if (player->GetPlayerData()->IsQuestLogChangesMaskSkipped()) {\n    //\
      \ Handle case where quest updates are being suppressed\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_PLAYER,\
      \ \"Quest log changes are currently skipped for player %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the TrinityCore framework to manage
    quest state consistency during asynchronous operations. It may be related to the
    internal state management of the player's quest log and should not typically be
    called directly from game logic unless handling special transitions or debugging.
