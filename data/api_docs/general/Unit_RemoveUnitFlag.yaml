  class: Unit
  method: RemoveUnitFlag
  signature: void Unit::RemoveUnitFlag(UnitFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes specified unit flags from a Unit object, effectively disabling certain
    game mechanics behaviors.
  description: The RemoveUnitFlag method removes one or more unit flags from a Unit
    object, which controls various game mechanics such as movement restrictions, combat
    states, and visibility. This method is commonly used to modify the behavior of
    NPCs or players during gameplay events, particularly when transitioning between
    different states like combat, stealth, or movement. The operation affects the
    internal flag state of the unit and can be used to restore normal functionality
    after applying temporary flags.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The unit flags to remove from the Unit object. This parameter accepts
      a bitmask of UnitFlags values, allowing multiple flags to be removed simultaneously.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();


      // Remove combat flag

      target->RemoveUnitFlag(UnitFlags::UNIT_FLAG_COMBAT);


      // Remove stealth flag

      target->RemoveUnitFlag(UnitFlags::UNIT_FLAG_STEALTH);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "// Remove multiple flags at once\nUnitFlags flags = UnitFlags::UNIT_FLAG_COMBAT\
      \ | UnitFlags::UNIT_FLAG_STEALTH;\n\n// Remove flags from unit\ntarget->RemoveUnitFlag(flags);\n\
      \n// Check if flag was removed\nif (!target->HasUnitFlag(UnitFlags::UNIT_FLAG_COMBAT))\
      \ {\n    // Combat flag is no longer active\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on the internal flag state of the Unit object and may
    affect visibility, movement, and combat behaviors depending on which flags are
    removed. Performance considerations should be noted when removing multiple flags
    in sequence, as each removal requires a separate operation.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in game mechanics,
    especially if flags are removed without proper consideration of their effects
    on the unit's state. Care must be taken when removing flags that are tied to specific
    game states like combat or stealth.
