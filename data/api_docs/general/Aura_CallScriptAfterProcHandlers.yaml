  class: Aura
  method: CallScriptAfterProcHandlers
  signature: void Aura::CallScriptAfterProcHandlers(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    ProcEventInfo & eventInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Invokes all registered script handlers after an aura proc event has occurred.
  description: The CallScriptAfterProcHandlers method is responsible for executing
    all script-based handlers that are registered to respond to proc events triggered
    by auras. This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during the processing of aura procs, ensuring that any custom logic defined in
    script handlers is executed after the base proc mechanics have been handled. It
    takes an AuraApplication object and a ProcEventInfo structure as parameters to
    provide context about the specific aura application and the event that triggered
    the proc. This method plays a crucial role in extending the functionality of auras
    through scripting without modifying core game logic.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura that
      triggered the proc event. This parameter provides context about which specific
      aura instance is involved in the proc.
  - name: eventInfo
    description: Reference to a ProcEventInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the proc event, including triggering conditions, affected targets, and
      other relevant data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura script
    code: "void MyAuraScript::AfterProc(AuraApplication const* aurApp, ProcEventInfo&\
      \ eventInfo)\n{\n    // Custom logic after proc\n    if (eventInfo.GetProcTarget())\n\
      \    {\n        eventInfo.GetProcTarget()->CastSpell(eventInfo.GetProcTarget(),\
      \ 12345, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the aura system and should
    not be called directly unless implementing custom aura behavior. The method assumes
    that all script handlers have been properly registered with the aura before this
    point.
