  class: ThreatCalculator
  method: GetSpecializationThreatModifier
  signature: float ThreatCalculator::GetSpecializationThreatModifier(uint8 classId,
    uint8 spec)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the threat modifier value based on player class and
    specialization.
  description: The GetSpecializationThreatModifier method retrieves a float value
    that represents how much additional or reduced threat a player generates based
    on their class and specialization. This modifier is used in the game's threat
    system to adjust how quickly enemies become aggroed on players, particularly for
    classes with unique abilities that influence threat generation. The method takes
    into account both the player's class (as defined by the Class enum) and their
    active specialization (such as Fury, Protection, or Enhancement for Warriors).
    This value is typically used internally by the ThreatCalculator to compute final
    threat values during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the specialization-based threat modifier. Positive
    values increase threat generation, while negative values reduce it. The exact
    range depends on game balance and class-specific mechanics, but typically falls
    within a reasonable range like -1.0 to 2.0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat logic
    code: "float modifier = threatCalculator.GetSpecializationThreatModifier(1, 3);\
      \ // Warrior with Arms spec\nif (modifier > 1.0f)\n{\n    // Apply increased\
      \ threat scaling for this specialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or computed once per player session to avoid
    repeated calculations during combat. The modifier values are hardcoded in the
    game's configuration and may be adjusted through balance updates or patches.
  warnings: Do not use this method outside of threat calculation contexts, as it assumes
    valid class and spec IDs. Passing invalid class or specialization values may result
    in unexpected behavior or incorrect threat modifiers.
