documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Blood Death Knight AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The BloodDeathKnightRefactored constructor initializes a Blood Death
    Knight AI bot by setting up its core attributes, abilities, and behavior patterns
    based on the provided Player object. This method configures the bot's specialization-specific
    mechanics such as blood rune generation, death strike usage, and defensive abilities.
    The initialization process ensures that the bot can properly execute combat strategies
    tailored for the Blood Death Knight class in TrinityCore's AI system. This constructor
    is typically called when spawning or activating a Blood Death Knight NPC bot within
    the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* botPlayer = ...; // Get reference to player

      BloodDeathKnightRefactored bloodDK(botPlayer);

      // Bot is now initialized and ready for AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    parameter must not be null or invalid, as it serves as the foundation for all
    bot behaviors and state management. The initialization process may involve loading
    class-specific spell data and setting up combat routines.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid Player pointer will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the Player object is fully initialized and valid before
    passing it to this constructor.
