  class: InteractionMetrics
  method: RecordAttempt
  signature: void InteractionMetrics::RecordAttempt(bool success, std::chrono::milliseconds
    duration)
documentation:
  brief: Records an interaction attempt with success status and duration for metrics
    tracking.
  description: The RecordAttempt method logs a single interaction attempt within the
    game system, capturing whether the attempt was successful and how long it took
    to complete. This method is typically used for performance monitoring, player
    behavior analysis, or debugging interaction-related systems such as quest completions,
    NPC dialogues, or item usage. It updates internal metrics counters and timing
    data that may be used later for reporting or optimization purposes. The method
    does not require any specific preconditions but should be called consistently
    to maintain accurate tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the interaction attempt was successful
      (true) or failed (false).
  - name: duration
    description: The time taken for the interaction attempt, measured in milliseconds.
      Used to track performance and responsiveness.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of RecordAttempt
    code: 'InteractionMetrics metrics;

      metrics.RecordAttempt(true, std::chrono::milliseconds(150));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording a failed interaction attempt
    code: 'InteractionMetrics metrics;

      metrics.RecordAttempt(false, std::chrono::milliseconds(300));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and thread-safe for concurrent
    use in high-frequency scenarios like player interactions. It internally manages
    atomic counters and timing data to ensure accuracy without blocking other operations.
