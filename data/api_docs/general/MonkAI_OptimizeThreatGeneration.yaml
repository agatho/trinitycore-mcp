  method: OptimizeThreatGeneration
  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeThreatGeneration()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes threat generation for the Monk AI by adjusting combat behavior
    and ability usage.
  description: The OptimizeThreatGeneration method is responsible for dynamically
    adjusting the Monk AI's combat behavior to maximize threat accumulation while
    maintaining optimal resource management. This method evaluates the current combat
    state, enemy positions, and available abilities to determine the most effective
    sequence of actions that will generate the highest amount of threat. It considers
    factors such as distance to target, health percentages, and cooldown states of
    various monk abilities. The method is typically called during the AI's update
    cycle to ensure that threat generation remains efficient throughout the encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    OptimizeThreatGeneration();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI's update cycle to maintain
    optimal threat generation. The implementation likely involves complex decision-making
    algorithms that consider multiple combat factors simultaneously. Performance is
    critical as this method may be called frequently during active combat.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method outside of the AI update context as it may lead
    to inconsistent behavior or incorrect threat calculations. The method modifies
    internal AI state and should not be used for manual threat manipulation.
