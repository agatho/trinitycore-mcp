  class: PlayerbotPacketSniffer
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: Statistics PlayerbotPacketSniffer::GetStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves packet statistics from the playerbot sniffer for monitoring and
    analysis purposes.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a Statistics object containing detailed
    information about captured packets, including counts, sizes, and timing data.
    This method is primarily used by playerbot AI systems to analyze network traffic
    patterns and optimize bot behavior. The returned statistics help developers understand
    packet usage, identify bottlenecks, and improve the efficiency of automated player
    actions within the TrinityCore environment. The method does not modify any internal
    state and can be called at any time during a session.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Statistics object containing packet capture metrics such as total packets
    processed, average packet size, timing information, and other relevant telemetry
    data that reflects the current state of the packet sniffer.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Statistics stats = playerbotSniffer.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total packets: " << stats.totalPackets << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Average size: " << stats.averagePacketSize << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads without
    synchronization concerns. The returned Statistics object is a snapshot of the
    current state at the time of the call, not a live reference to internal data structures.
