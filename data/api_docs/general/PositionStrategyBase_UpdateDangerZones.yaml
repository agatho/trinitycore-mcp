documentation:
  brief: Updates the danger zones for the position strategy based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateDangerZones method is responsible for refreshing and recalculating
    the state of danger zones within a position strategy. This typically involves
    updating timers, checking for zone expiration, or adjusting threat levels based
    on the time delta provided by the game loop. The method is called periodically
    by the AI system to ensure that the positioning logic remains responsive to dynamic
    changes in the environment, such as incoming attacks or changing combat conditions.
    It plays a crucial role in maintaining accurate pathfinding and positioning decisions
    for NPCs or players using this strategy.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    positionStrategy->UpdateDangerZones(diff);\n\
      \    // ... rest of game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the AI update cycle, where 'diff'
    represents the time elapsed since the last update. It's important to ensure that
    this method does not block or perform heavy computations, as it may be called
    frequently during combat or movement updates.
