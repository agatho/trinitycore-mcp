documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is currently in the process of loading.
  description: The PlayerLoading method determines whether a player character is in
    the middle of the loading process, typically occurring when a player logs in or
    respawns. This flag is used internally by the server to manage game state and
    prevent certain operations during the loading phase. The method returns true if
    the player's session is in a loading state, and false otherwise. This is particularly
    important for preventing actions like movement or spell casting during the critical
    loading period.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently loading (e.g., during login or
    respawn), false if the player has finished loading and is fully active in the
    world.
  examples:
  - title: Check Player Loading State
    code: "if (session->PlayerLoading()) {\n    // Handle loading state\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_PLAYER,\
      \ \"Player is still loading...\");\n} else {\n    // Player is fully loaded\
      \ and active\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_PLAYER, \"Player is ready for gameplay\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other session state checks
    to ensure proper synchronization of player actions during loading phases. The
    loading state may be set and cleared automatically by the server during login,
    logout, and respawn sequences.
