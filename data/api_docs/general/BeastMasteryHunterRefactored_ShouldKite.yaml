  method: ShouldKite
  signature: bool BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::ShouldKite(int * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the beast mastery hunter should kite enemies based on
    current combat state and positioning.
  description: The ShouldKite method evaluates the current combat situation for a
    beast mastery hunter to decide if it is advantageous to maintain distance from
    targets rather than engaging in melee combat. This decision considers factors
    such as enemy proximity, available pet abilities, player health, and threat levels.
    The method is typically used within the AI logic of the hunter to optimize positioning
    and damage output during encounters. It returns true when kiting behavior should
    be initiated or maintained, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the beast mastery hunter should kite enemies; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (hunter->ShouldKite()) {\n    // Initiate kiting behavior\n    hunter->SetMovementType(MOVEMENT_TYPE_KITE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with the hunter's threat management system
    and pet positioning logic. It may be called frequently during combat updates to
    dynamically adjust behavior based on changing conditions.
