  brief: Updates the skill level of a player within the PlayerSkillProfile.
  description: The UpdateSkillLevel method is responsible for recalculating and applying
    any changes to a player's skill levels based on current game state, including
    experience gains, level-ups, or modifications to skill caps. This method typically
    gets invoked when a player performs actions that affect their skills, such as
    crafting, combat, or learning new abilities. It ensures that the player's skill
    data remains synchronized with the game's internal state and can trigger updates
    to UI elements like skill bars or proficiency displays. The method may also handle
    validation of skill limits and prevent invalid skill modifications.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* profile = player->GetSkillProfile();

      profile->UpdateSkillLevel();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any operation that modifies a player's
    skill data to ensure consistency. It may internally perform checks for skill caps
    and level progression, so calling it frequently could have performance implications
    in high-frequency scenarios.
