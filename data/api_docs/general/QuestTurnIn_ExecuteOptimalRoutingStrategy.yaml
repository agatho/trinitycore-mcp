  method: ExecuteOptimalRoutingStrategy
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ExecuteOptimalRoutingStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the optimal routing strategy for quest turn-ins based on player
    bot's current state and available quest data.
  description: The ExecuteOptimalRoutingStrategy method determines the most efficient
    path for a player bot to complete quest turn-ins. It evaluates available quests,
    checks quest requirements, and selects the best sequence of actions to maximize
    quest completion efficiency. The method considers factors such as quest dependencies,
    item availability, NPC locations, and player resource levels. This function is
    typically used in automated questing systems or AI-driven bots within the TrinityCore
    framework to optimize gameplay progression.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the optimal routing strategy for quest turn-ins. Must be a valid player instance
      with active quest data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      questTurnIn.ExecuteOptimalRoutingStrategy(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nif (bot != nullptr) {\n    QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;\n\
      \    questTurnIn.ExecuteOptimalRoutingStrategy(bot);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid bot pointer\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player bot has already been initialized with
    valid quest data and that all necessary quest requirements have been checked.
    The routing algorithm may prioritize quests based on reputation gains, experience
    rewards, or other configurable factors depending on the server settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. This method modifies internal bot state during execution
    and should not be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
