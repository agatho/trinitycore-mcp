  class: BotSession
  method: LoginCharacter
  signature: bool BotSession::LoginCharacter(int characterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Logs in a bot character using the provided character GUID.
  description: The LoginCharacter method attempts to authenticate and log in a bot
    character within the TrinityCore framework using the specified character GUID.
    This method is typically used in botting systems or automated character management
    scenarios where a bot session needs to be initialized for a specific character.
    The method likely performs validation checks on the character GUID, ensures the
    character exists and is valid, and establishes the necessary session state for
    the bot to operate. It may also handle loading of character data, setting up game
    state, and initializing any required subsystems for bot operations.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character to log in. This should
      be a valid 32-bit integer representing the character's database ID.
  returns: Returns true if the character login was successful and the bot session
    was properly initialized, false otherwise. Failure conditions may include invalid
    character GUID, non-existent character, or authentication errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Character Login
    code: "BotSession session;\nbool success = session.LoginCharacter(12345);\nif\
      \ (success) {\n    // Bot character logged in successfully\n    printf(\"Bot\
      \ character logged in successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle login failure\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to log in bot character\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires the bot system to be properly initialized before
    calling. The character GUID must correspond to a valid character in the database,
    and the character should not already be logged in. Implementation may involve
    database queries and session management operations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent character GUID will
    likely result in a failed login attempt. Ensure that the character exists in the
    database before attempting to log in. This method may not be thread-safe if multiple
    threads attempt to login different characters simultaneously.
