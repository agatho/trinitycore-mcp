  class: MovementIntegration
  method: MoveToPosition
  signature: void MovementIntegration::MoveToPosition(const int & pos, bool urgent)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a movement action to a specified position within the game world.
  description: The MoveToPosition method instructs an AI-controlled unit or object
    to navigate toward a given coordinate position in the game world. This method
    is typically used in AI behavior scripting to control movement patterns, pathfinding,
    and positioning of NPCs or creatures. The 'urgent' parameter determines whether
    the movement should be prioritized and executed immediately, bypassing normal
    movement queue handling. Movement operations initiated through this method are
    usually asynchronous and may involve path calculation, obstacle avoidance, and
    dynamic adjustment based on terrain and game state.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The target position index or identifier that specifies where the
      unit should move to. This parameter typically refers to a predefined location
      in the AI's movement database or world coordinates.
  - name: urgent
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the movement should be executed
      with high priority. When true, the movement is prioritized and may interrupt
      ongoing actions; when false, it follows normal queue processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement to Position
    code: 'MovementIntegration movement;

      int targetPosition = 5;

      movement.MoveToPosition(targetPosition, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Urgent Movement to Critical Position
    code: 'MovementIntegration movement;

      int criticalPosition = 12;

      movement.MoveToPosition(criticalPosition, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying AI system's pathfinding capabilities
    and may not immediately execute if path calculation is pending. The 'pos' parameter
    must reference a valid position defined in the AI's movement table or world map
    data. Consider performance implications when calling this method frequently in
    tight loops.
  warnings: Calling MoveToPosition with invalid position indices may result in undefined
    behavior or failed movement attempts. Avoid using urgent=true in scenarios where
    it could cause conflicts with other active AI behaviors or player interactions.
