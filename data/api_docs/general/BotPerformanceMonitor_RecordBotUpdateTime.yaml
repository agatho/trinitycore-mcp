  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordBotUpdateTime
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordBotUpdateTime(uint32 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records the execution time of a bot update cycle in microseconds for performance
    monitoring.
  description: The RecordBotUpdateTime method logs the duration of a single bot update
    cycle by storing the provided microsecond value. This method is typically called
    at the end of a bot's update loop to track how long each update takes, which helps
    in identifying performance bottlenecks or optimizing bot behavior. The recorded
    data can be used for profiling and debugging purposes within the TrinityCore framework.
    It is expected that this method is invoked regularly during bot operation to maintain
    an accurate performance profile.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The time taken to complete a single bot update cycle, measured in
      microseconds. This value should be a positive integer representing the elapsed
      time from start to finish of the update process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot update loop
    code: 'uint32 startTime = getMSTime();

      // Perform bot logic here

      uint32 endTime = getMSTime();

      botPerformanceMonitor->RecordBotUpdateTime(endTime - startTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording update time with detailed timing
    code: "uint64 start = getMSTime();\n{\n    // Bot AI logic\n    bot->UpdateAI();\n\
      }\nuint64 end = getMSTime();\nbotPerformanceMonitor->RecordBotUpdateTime(static_cast<uint32>(end\
      \ - start));"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a performance monitoring system and should be called
    consistently during bot updates. The recorded values are likely aggregated or
    averaged over time to provide meaningful metrics for performance analysis.
