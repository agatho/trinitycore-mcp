documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the restoration druid is currently in a tanking role based
    on current combat state and ability usage.
  description: The IsTank method evaluates if the restoration druid is fulfilling
    a tanking function within the group. This typically involves checking if the druid
    has active threat management abilities, is positioned to take damage, or is actively
    mitigating incoming attacks. The method may consider factors such as current target
    selection, defensive cooldowns, and aggro status. It's commonly used in AI decision-making
    to determine when to switch roles or activate specific defensive mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the restoration druid is currently acting as a tank; otherwise
    returns false. The determination may be based on combat state, ability usage,
    and threat management behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (druid.IsTank()) {\n    // Activate defensive abilities\n    druid.UseBarkskin();\n\
      \    druid.UseIronbark();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Switching Decision
    code: "if (!druid.IsTank() && group.GetTank() == nullptr) {\n    // Druid should\
      \ take tanking role\n    druid.SetAsTank();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state tracking of the druid's combat
    behavior and may not directly query the player's current target or threat level.
    The implementation might be influenced by the druid's current specialization,
    gear, and available cooldowns.
  warnings: The method may return false positives or negatives in edge cases where
    the druid is in a hybrid role or when combat mechanics are not fully synchronized
    with the AI state. Developers should consider caching results to avoid frequent
    calls during high-frequency updates.
