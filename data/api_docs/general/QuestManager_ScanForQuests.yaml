  brief: Scans for available quests in the player's current zone and updates the quest
    log accordingly.
  description: The ScanForQuests method is responsible for identifying and processing
    all quests that are currently available to the player within their active zone.
    This method typically checks for quest givers, quest objectives, and quest completion
    conditions to ensure the player's quest log reflects the most up-to-date information.
    It is commonly invoked during player login, zone changes, or when specific quest-related
    events occur. The method does not directly interact with the database but rather
    processes existing quest data in memory to update the player's visible quest status.

  - title: Basic Quest Scan
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    // Scan for available quests upon login\n\
      \    GetQuestManager().ScanForQuests();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the core during player initialization
    and zone transitions. It should not be invoked manually in most cases unless specifically
    required for quest state synchronization.
