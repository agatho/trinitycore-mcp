  class: CriteriaHandler
  method: SendAllData
  signature: void CriteriaHandler::SendAllData(const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends all criteria data to the specified player.
  description: The SendAllData method is responsible for transmitting complete criteria
    information to a given player client. This method is typically invoked during
    player login or when criteria data needs to be synchronized with the client. It
    ensures that the player's interface displays accurate and up-to-date criterion
    progress, achievements, and related tracking information. The method operates
    on the CriteriaHandler class which manages criterion-related data within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will receive the criteria data.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CriteriaHandler handler;

      Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get player reference

      handler.SendAllData(targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage During Player Login
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    CriteriaHandler criteriaHandler;\n\
      \    criteriaHandler.SendAllData(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely serializes criterion data into packets and sends them
    to the client. It may involve multiple network messages depending on the amount
    of criteria data. The method should only be called when the player is fully initialized
    and connected.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null receiver pointer will cause a crash. Ensure
    that the player object is valid and connected before invoking this method. This
    method might be performance-intensive if a large number of criteria exist for
    the player.
