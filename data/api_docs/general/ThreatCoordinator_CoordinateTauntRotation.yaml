  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: CoordinateTauntRotation
  signature: bool ThreatCoordinator::CoordinateTauntRotation(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates taunt rotation for a target unit within the threat coordinator
    system.
  description: The CoordinateTauntRotation method manages the rotation of taunt effects
    among units in the threat coordinator, ensuring proper handling of taunt mechanics
    when a target unit is involved. This method typically handles logic related to
    maintaining or updating threat tables, managing taunt priorities, and coordinating
    taunt application across multiple units. It may be invoked during combat events
    where taunts are applied or reassigned to maintain balanced threat distribution
    among enemies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the taunt rotation was successfully coordinated for the
    target unit; otherwise returns false if coordination failed or no action was taken.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taunt Rotation Coordination
    code: "if (threatCoordinator.CoordinateTauntRotation(targetUnit)) {\n    // Taunt\
      \ rotation handled successfully\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"Threat\", \"Taunt rotation\
      \ coordinated for target {}\", targetUnit->GetName());\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to coordinate taunt rotation\n    LOG_ERROR(\"Threat\", \"Failed to coordinate\
      \ taunt rotation for target {}\", targetUnit->GetName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger threat management system and may interact
    with internal threat tables, unit states, and combat logic. It's important to
    ensure that the target unit is valid and in a combat state before calling this
    method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the target unit or during
    invalid game states may lead to undefined behavior or inconsistent threat management.
    Ensure that the target unit exists and is engaged in combat.
