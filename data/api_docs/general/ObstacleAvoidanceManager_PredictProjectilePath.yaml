  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: PredictProjectilePath
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::PredictProjectilePath(WorldObject * projectile)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future path of a projectile to avoid obstacles in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore engine.
  description: The PredictProjectilePath method calculates and returns the predicted
    trajectory of a given projectile object, taking into account potential obstacles
    in its path. This functionality is crucial for AI-driven movement systems and
    spell mechanics within the TrinityCore framework. The method evaluates the projectile's
    current position, velocity, and environmental factors to determine an optimal
    avoidance path. It typically involves complex physics calculations and collision
    detection algorithms to ensure accurate predictions. The return value indicates
    success or failure of the prediction process, with positive values usually signifying
    successful computation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the outcome of the path prediction.
    A positive value typically signifies successful path calculation, while negative
    values may indicate errors such as invalid input parameters, unreachable targets,
    or computational failures. Zero may represent a special case like no obstacles
    detected in the path.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Projectile Path Prediction
    code: "ObstacleAvoidanceManager* avoidanceMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayerByGUID(playerGuid)->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager();\n\
      WorldObject* projectile = sObjectAccessor->GetGameObjectByEntry(playerGuid,\
      \ 12345);\nint result = avoidanceMgr->PredictProjectilePath(projectile);\nif\
      \ (result > 0) {\n    // Path prediction successful\n    // Proceed with obstacle\
      \ avoidance logic\n} else {\n    // Handle prediction failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI behavior trees and spell casting systems
    where accurate projectile movement prediction is essential. The implementation
    likely involves raycasting, collision detection, and pathfinding algorithms to
    determine obstacle positions and calculate alternative trajectories. Performance
    can be impacted by the complexity of the environment and number of obstacles detected.
  warnings: The method assumes valid WorldObject inputs; passing null or invalid objects
    may lead to undefined behavior. This function should only be called during appropriate
    game states where projectile movement is expected, as calling it outside these
    contexts may produce incorrect results or crash the application.
