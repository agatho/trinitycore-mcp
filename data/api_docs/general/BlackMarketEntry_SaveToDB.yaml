  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: SaveToDB
  signature: void BlackMarketEntry::SaveToDB(int trans) const
documentation:
  brief: Saves the BlackMarketEntry object to the database using the provided transaction.
  description: The SaveToDB method persists the current state of a BlackMarketEntry
    object into the database. This method is typically used within the context of
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to synchronize in-memory black market
    auction data with the persistent database storage. The method accepts an optional
    transaction parameter that allows for batch operations or rollback capabilities.
    It ensures that all relevant fields of the black market entry are written to their
    respective database tables, maintaining data consistency for black market auctions.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Optional database transaction identifier. If provided, the save operation
      will be executed within the context of this transaction. A value of -1 indicates
      no transaction is used, and the method will manage its own transaction handling.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage with Transaction
    code: 'BlackMarketEntry entry;

      // ... populate entry fields ...

      entry.SaveToDB(12345); // Save using existing transaction ID'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage without Transaction
    code: 'BlackMarketEntry entry;

      // ... populate entry fields ...

      entry.SaveToDB(-1); // Save without explicit transaction'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the BlackMarketEntry object has been
    properly initialized and populated with valid data. The method assumes that all
    necessary preconditions for database access are met, including proper database
    connection state and appropriate permissions.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid BlackMarketEntry object
    may result in undefined behavior or database corruption. Always validate the object's
    state before calling SaveToDB.
