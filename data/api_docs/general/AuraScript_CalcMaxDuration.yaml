  class: AuraScript
  method: CalcMaxDuration
  signature: int AuraScript::CalcMaxDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the maximum duration of an aura in milliseconds.
  description: The CalcMaxDuration method computes the maximum possible duration for
    an aura, which is typically used in AuraScript implementations to determine how
    long an aura effect should last. This calculation may take into account various
    factors such as caster's level, spell modifiers, or specific aura properties.
    The returned value represents the duration in milliseconds and is often used in
    conjunction with other aura management functions to control how long effects persist
    on targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum duration of the aura in milliseconds.
    A negative value typically indicates an infinite duration, while zero or positive
    values represent finite durations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AuraScript
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void Register()\
      \ override\n    {\n        OnCalcMaxDuration += AuraScript::CalcMaxDurationCallback(&MyAuraScript::CalcMaxDuration);\n\
      \    }\n\n    int CalcMaxDuration() const override\n    {\n        // Example:\
      \ Set duration to 30 seconds\n        return 30000;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically overridden in custom AuraScript classes to provide
    specific duration calculations. It's important to note that the base implementation
    may return a default value, and custom implementations should consider all relevant
    factors such as caster level, spell power, or aura-specific modifiers.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned duration is appropriate for the intended gameplay
    effect. Setting excessively long durations can cause performance issues or unbalanced
    gameplay. Also, be aware that some auras may have special handling for infinite
    durations (negative values).
