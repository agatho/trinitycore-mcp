  class: QuestStrategy
  method: CollectQuestItems
  signature: void QuestStrategy::CollectQuestItems(BotAI * ai, const int & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Collects quest items for the bot AI based on the specified objective.
  description: The CollectQuestItems method is responsible for gathering required
    quest items for a bot AI character. It takes an AI instance and a specific objective
    number to determine which items need to be collected. This method typically interacts
    with the bot's inventory management system to locate, pick up, and potentially
    use or trade items needed to complete a quest objective. The method operates within
    the context of TrinityCore's AI framework where bots follow scripted behaviors
    to progress through quests automatically.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will perform the quest item collection.
      This represents the bot's AI controller which manages its actions and decision-making.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to an integer representing the specific quest objective
      number. This value determines which items are required for the given quest objective,
      typically correlating with quest data in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Item Collection
    code: "void example() {\n    BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();\n    int questObjective\
      \ = 1;\n    QuestStrategy strategy;\n    strategy.CollectQuestItems(botAI, questObjective);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on the bot's quest database entries and item requirements
    to determine what items need to be collected. It may trigger inventory checks,
    item pickup routines, and potentially interact with the game's quest tracking
    system to update progress.
