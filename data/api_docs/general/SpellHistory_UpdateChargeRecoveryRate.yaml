  class: SpellHistory
  method: UpdateChargeRecoveryRate
  signature: void SpellHistory::UpdateChargeRecoveryRate(int chargeCategoryId, float
    modChange, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the charge recovery rate for a specified spell charge category.
  description: The UpdateChargeRecoveryRate method modifies the rate at which spell
    charges recover for a given charge category. This is typically used to apply temporary
    or permanent modifiers to how quickly charges replenish, such as during buff effects
    or debuffs. The method adjusts internal timers and recovery rates based on the
    provided modification factor. It can either apply or remove a modifier depending
    on the 'apply' parameter. This functionality is crucial for implementing abilities
    with limited uses that gradually refill over time.
  parameters:
  - name: chargeCategoryId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell charge category to modify. This
      corresponds to a specific group of spells sharing the same charge recovery mechanics.
  - name: modChange
    description: The modifier value applied to the charge recovery rate. Positive
      values increase recovery speed, negative values decrease it. A value of 1.0
      represents no change.
  - name: apply
    description: If true, applies the modifier; if false, removes it. This allows
      for temporary or permanent adjustments to charge recovery rates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply a 50% faster charge recovery rate
    code: spellHistory->UpdateChargeRecoveryRate(123, 1.5f, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove a previously applied modifier
    code: spellHistory->UpdateChargeRecoveryRate(123, 1.0f, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on internal charge recovery timers and should be called
    whenever spell charge modifiers change. It's commonly used in conjunction with
    aura application/removal logic to dynamically adjust how quickly charges refill.
  warnings: Incorrectly applying or removing modifiers can lead to inconsistent charge
    behavior, potentially causing spells to appear as if they have infinite charges
    or never recover. Ensure that every 'apply' call has a corresponding 'remove'
    call to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
