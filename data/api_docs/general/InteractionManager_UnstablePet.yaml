  signature: bool InteractionManager::UnstablePet(Player * bot, Creature * stableMaster,
    uint32 petSlot)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to unstable a pet from the stable master's inventory.
  description: The UnstablePet method handles the process of removing a pet from a
    stable master's inventory and returning it to the player. This function is typically
    used in the context of pet management within World of Warcraft's stable system,
    where players can store and retrieve their pets. The method checks if the specified
    pet slot contains a valid pet and performs the necessary operations to transfer
    ownership back to the player. It ensures proper interaction with the stable master's
    creature interface and handles any required validation or error conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player attempting
      to unstable the pet.
  - name: stableMaster
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the stable master NPC
      from whom the pet will be unstabled.
  - name: petSlot
    description: The slot number of the pet within the stable master's inventory that
      should be unstabled. Valid values typically range from 0 to the maximum number
      of stable slots available.
  returns: Returns true if the pet was successfully unstabled and transferred to the
    player, or false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters, unavailable
    pet in slot, or other error conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UnstablePet
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* stableMaster = ...;\nuint32 petSlot = 0;\n\
      bool success = sInteractionManager->UnstablePet(bot, stableMaster, petSlot);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Pet successfully unstabled\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed\
      \ to unstable pet\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's pet database and stable system
    to ensure proper state management. It may involve checking for valid pet ownership,
    verifying that the stable master is accessible, and ensuring the pet slot contains
    a valid entry before proceeding with the unstable operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid Player object and that
    the stableMaster parameter refers to an actual stable master NPC. Passing invalid
    or null pointers may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, verify that
    the petSlot is within the valid range for the stable master's inventory.
