  signature: void NullCreatureAI::OnCharmed(bool param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a creature is charmed by a player or unit
  description: The OnCharmed method is called when a creature AI instance is notified
    that the creature has been charmed, typically through spell effects like 'Mind
    Control' or 'Charm'. This method serves as a hook for custom AI behavior when
    a creature's control state changes. The method receives a boolean parameter indicating
    whether the creature is being charmed (true) or uncharmed (false). This allows
    the AI to perform specific actions such as resetting behavior, changing faction,
    or triggering events based on the charm status.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the creature is being charmed (true) or
      uncharmed (false)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic charm handling in custom AI
    code: "class MyCustomAI : public NullCreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCharmed(bool\
      \ isCharmed) override {\n        if (isCharmed) {\n            // Creature is\
      \ charmed, change behavior\n            me->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Creature is no longer charmed, restore normal\
      \ behavior\n            me->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n        }\n  \
      \  }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI event system in TrinityCore and is typically
    invoked by the core engine when charm effects are applied or removed. The NullCreatureAI
    implementation provides a default no-op behavior, but derived classes can override
    this to implement custom logic.
