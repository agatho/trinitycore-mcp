  class: BotLifecycle
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void BotLifecycle::UpdateMetrics(uint32 aiUpdateTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics and tracking data for bot AI behavior based on the
    provided update time interval.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    various performance and behavioral metrics within the BotLifecycle system. It
    processes timing information from the AI update cycle to track how efficiently
    bots are operating, including processing time, decision-making frequency, and
    resource utilization. This method ensures that bot behavior remains optimized
    by collecting data on AI execution times and adjusting internal tracking mechanisms
    accordingly. The method is typically called during the game loop's AI update phase,
    where it receives a time delta (aiUpdateTime) to calculate and store relevant
    performance statistics.
  parameters:
  - name: aiUpdateTime
    description: The time interval in milliseconds since the last AI update cycle.
      This value represents how much time has passed since the previous metrics update,
      used to calculate average processing times and update internal counters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateBots()\n{\n    uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\n\
      \    uint32 deltaTime = currentTime - m_lastBotUpdateTime;\n    m_botLifecycle->UpdateMetrics(deltaTime);\n\
      \    m_lastBotUpdateTime = currentTime;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Manager
    code: "void AIBotManager::UpdateAllBots()\n{\n    for (auto& bot : m_bots)\n \
      \   {\n        if (bot->IsAlive())\n        {\n            uint32 aiUpdateTime\
      \ = bot->GetAI()->GetLastUpdateTime();\n            bot->GetBotLifecycle()->UpdateMetrics(aiUpdateTime);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during the game loop, typically
    every AI update cycle. It's important that aiUpdateTime accurately reflects the
    actual time elapsed since the last call to avoid skewed performance metrics. The
    method may internally perform calculations that could impact performance if called
    too frequently without proper batching.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect or zero time values can lead to inaccurate
    metrics and potentially cause issues with bot behavior optimization. Ensure that
    aiUpdateTime is always a positive value representing actual elapsed time in milliseconds.
