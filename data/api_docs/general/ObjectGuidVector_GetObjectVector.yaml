documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the ObjectVector associated with the provided WorldObject
    reference.
  description: The GetObjectVector method retrieves a const pointer to an ObjectVector
    that corresponds to the given WorldObject reference. This method is typically
    used in the context of TrinityCore's object management system, where objects are
    organized and accessed through vectors for efficient traversal and processing.
    The returned pointer allows access to a collection of objects related to or associated
    with the specified reference object. It is important to note that this method
    does not perform any modification of the underlying data structures; it only provides
    read-only access to the associated vector. The method assumes that the WorldObject
    reference has been properly initialized and registered within the system's object
    tracking mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an ObjectVector that contains objects related to the
    provided WorldObject reference. Returns nullptr if no corresponding vector exists
    for the given reference or if the reference is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const ObjectVector* objectVector = guidVector.GetObjectVector(*player);\n\
      if (objectVector != nullptr) {\n    // Process the objects in the vector\n \
      \   for (const auto& obj : *objectVector) {\n        // Do something with each\
      \ object\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "WorldObject* refObject = ...; // Some WorldObject reference\nconst ObjectVector*\
      \ vector = guidVector.GetObjectVector(*refObject);\nif (vector && !vector->empty())\
      \ {\n    for (const auto& obj : *vector) {\n        if (obj && obj->IsPlayer())\
      \ {\n            // Handle player objects\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be efficient and should not cause performance
    bottlenecks in normal usage. The returned ObjectVector pointer must not be modified
    directly, as it's a const pointer. Ensure that the WorldObject reference passed
    to this method remains valid for the duration of use, as dangling references can
    lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not modify the contents of the returned ObjectVector through the pointer,
    as it is marked as const. Also, be cautious about using the returned pointer after
    the lifetime of the referenced WorldObject has ended, which may result in accessing
    freed memory or invalid data.
