documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the shaman defensive cooldowns for a player in PvP combat.
  description: The GetShamanDefensiveCooldowns method retrieves the current state
    of defensive cooldowns available to a shaman player during PvP encounters. This
    method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and is used to determine which defensive
    abilities are currently on cooldown for the shaman class. The returned value represents
    the number of active defensive cooldowns, with specific values indicating different
    cooldown states. This functionality is crucial for AI decision-making in PvP scenarios
    where shaman players must manage their defensive resources effectively.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count or state of active defensive
    cooldowns for the shaman player. A value of 0 typically indicates no active cooldowns,
    while positive values indicate the number or type of defensive cooldowns in effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int cooldowns = pvpCombatAI->GetShamanDefensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\nif\
      \ (cooldowns > 0) {\n    // Handle defensive cooldown state\n    printf(\"Shaman\
      \ has %d defensive cooldowns active\\n\", cooldowns);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed specifically for PvP combat scenarios and may not
    reflect PvE cooldown states. The implementation likely checks internal cooldown
    tracking mechanisms for shaman defensive abilities such as Earth Shield, Water
    Shield, or other class-specific defensive spells.
  warnings: The method signature includes a parameter that appears to be unused (int
    * player), which may indicate incomplete implementation or legacy code. Ensure
    proper null checking when calling this method in production environments.
