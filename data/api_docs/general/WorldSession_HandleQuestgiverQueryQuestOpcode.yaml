  brief: Processes a client request to query quest details from a questgiver NPC
  description: The HandleQuestgiverQueryQuestOpcode method handles incoming packets
    from the client when a player interacts with a questgiver NPC to request information
    about a specific quest. This method retrieves and sends back detailed quest information
    including quest title, description, objectives, rewards, and other relevant data
    to the player's client. The method is part of the core quest system in TrinityCore
    and ensures proper communication between the game server and client regarding
    quest state and details.

  - title: Basic Quest Query Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQuestgiverQueryQuestOpcode(WorldPackets::Quest::QuestGiverQueryQuest&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process the quest query from client\n    // Retrieve quest\
      \ data and send response\n    // This method is automatically invoked when player\
      \ clicks on questgiver\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the packet handling system
    when a client sends a QuestGiverQueryQuest opcode. It should not be called directly
    from other methods unless specifically required for custom quest handling logic.
