  signature: const int * ObjectMgr::GetQuestTemplate(uint32 quest_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a quest template by its unique identifier from the object manager's
    internal quest database.
  description: The GetQuestTemplate method fetches a quest template object corresponding
    to the specified quest ID. This function is used internally by the TrinityCore
    server to access quest definitions stored in memory, which are loaded at startup
    from database files. The returned pointer points to a constant quest template
    structure that contains all relevant quest data such as objectives, rewards, and
    quest flags. It is important to note that this method does not perform any validation
    on the input quest ID; it simply retrieves the corresponding quest template if
    it exists in the internal cache.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const int representing the quest template data structure
    for the specified quest ID, or nullptr if no such quest exists in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const int* questTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nif (questTemplate\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    // Process quest template data\n    printf(\"Quest found\
      \ with ID: %d\\n\", 12345);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Quest not found with ID:\
      \ %d\\n\", 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a cached version of quest data loaded at server startup.
    It is thread-safe for read operations but should not be used to modify quest templates
    directly. The returned pointer remains valid only as long as the server is running
    and the quest data has not been reloaded.
  warnings: The return value may be null if the specified quest ID does not exist
    in the database, so always check for null before dereferencing the pointer. Additionally,
    since this returns a const int*, modifying the underlying quest template through
    this pointer is undefined behavior and should never be attempted.
