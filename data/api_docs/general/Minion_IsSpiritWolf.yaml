documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the minion is a spirit wolf
  description: The IsSpiritWolf method checks if the current minion instance represents
    a spirit wolf. This functionality is primarily used in the context of shaman class
    abilities, particularly those related to summoning and managing spirit companions.
    The method returns true if the minion is specifically a spirit wolf, and false
    otherwise. This check is essential for proper handling of spirit wolf-specific
    mechanics such as spell effects, damage calculations, and behavior modifications
    within the game's AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the minion is a spirit wolf; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Shaman Ability
    code: "if (minion->IsSpiritWolf()) {\n    // Apply spirit wolf specific effects\n\
      \    unit->CastSpell(unit, SPELL_SPIRIT_WOLF_DAMAGE_BUFF, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic for Spirit Wolf Handling
    code: "Unit* target = unit->GetVictim();\nif (target && minion->IsSpiritWolf())\
      \ {\n    // Spirit wolves have special attack behavior\n    minion->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_SPIRIT_WOLF_CRITICAL_STRIKE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal minion type identification and should only
    be called on valid minion instances. The implementation likely checks against
    predefined spirit wolf creature types or GUID patterns to determine the minion's
    identity.
  warnings: Ensure that the minion pointer is not null before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. This method may not be suitable for checking summoned
    pets in general, as it specifically targets spirit wolves only.
