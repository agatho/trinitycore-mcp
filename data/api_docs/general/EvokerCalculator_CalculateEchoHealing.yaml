  signature: int EvokerCalculator::CalculateEchoHealing(int * caster, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the healing amount for an Echo spell based on caster and target
    parameters
  description: The CalculateEchoHealing method computes the healing value generated
    by the Echo ability in the Evoker class. This method takes two integer pointers
    representing the caster and target, and returns the calculated healing amount.
    The calculation likely considers factors such as the caster's spell power, the
    target's health status, and any applicable modifiers from the Echo ability. The
    method is part of the Evoker's healing mechanics and is used during the execution
    of the Echo spell to determine how much health is restored to the target.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's stats or identifier.
      This parameter likely contains information about the caster's spell power, level,
      or other relevant attributes that affect healing calculations.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's stats or identifier.
      This parameter likely contains information about the target's current health,
      maximum health, or other attributes that influence healing effectiveness.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated healing amount for
    the Echo spell. The value indicates how much health should be restored to the
    target. A return value of 0 typically means no healing was applied, while positive
    values indicate successful healing application.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Echo Healing Calculation
    code: 'int casterStats = 1500;

      int targetStats = 800;

      int* casterPtr = &casterStats;

      int* targetPtr = &targetStats;

      int healingAmount = calculator.CalculateEchoHealing(casterPtr, targetPtr);

      // healingAmount now contains the calculated Echo healing value'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Actual Player Objects
    code: "Player* evoker = ...; // Get evoker player object\nPlayer* target = ...;\
      \   // Get target player object\nint* casterPtr = &evoker->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_MAX_LEVEL);\n\
      int* targetPtr = &target->GetUInt32Value(PLAYER_FIELD_MAX_HEALTH);\nint healing\
      \ = calculator.CalculateEchoHealing(casterPtr, targetPtr);\nif (healing > 0)\n\
      {\n    target->ModifyHealth(healing);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger healing calculation system for the
    Evoker class. The actual implementation details may vary based on the specific
    mechanics of the Echo ability in TrinityCore. The parameters are passed as pointers,
    suggesting that the method may modify or read from these values during calculation.
  warnings: Ensure that both caster and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method to prevent undefined behavior. The method assumes that the pointed-to integers
    contain meaningful data related to spell power and health statistics for proper
    healing calculations.
