  method: Update

documentation:
  brief: Updates the quest pickup state based on the elapsed time since last update.
  description: The QuestPickup::Update method is responsible for managing the internal
    state of a quest pickup object, typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation. It processes time-based events and updates the pickup's
    status according to the game logic. This method is commonly called from the main
    game loop or update systems to ensure that quest pickup conditions are evaluated
    and updated regularly. The method takes a time delta parameter (diff) which represents
    the milliseconds elapsed since the last update, allowing for precise timing of
    quest-related events such as cooldowns, timers, or state transitions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The number of milliseconds that have passed since the last update
      call. This value is used to calculate time-based changes in the quest pickup's
      state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    questPickup->Update(diff);\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest System
    code: "class QuestManager\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateQuestPickups(uint32 diff)\n\
      \    {\n        for (auto& pickup : questPickups)\n        {\n            if\
      \ (pickup->IsActive())\n                pickup->Update(diff);\n        }\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the game's main update loop and should
    be called regularly to maintain proper quest state. The implementation may involve
    checking timers, updating cooldowns, or triggering events based on time progression.
    It is recommended to pass the exact delta time from the game loop for accurate
    timing.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without ensuring that the QuestPickup
    object is properly initialized and valid. Improper use of the diff parameter can
    lead to incorrect timing behavior in quest-related systems.
