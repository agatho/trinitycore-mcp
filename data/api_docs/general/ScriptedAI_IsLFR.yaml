  signature: bool ScriptedAI::IsLFR() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current instance is a LFR (Looking for Raid) dungeon.
  description: The IsLFR method checks if the current dungeon or raid encounter is
    configured as a Looking for Raid instance. This is commonly used in AI scripts
    to adjust behavior based on the difficulty and grouping mechanics of the instance.
    The method returns true when the instance is specifically marked as LFR, which
    typically implies a more accessible difficulty level with certain mechanics tailored
    for groups seeking raids without strict requirements. This is particularly relevant
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation where different instance types
    have distinct handling for player progression and loot distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current instance is an LFR dungeon, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the encounter is configured with LFR-specific mechanics
    and restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "class MyBossAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustEngagedWith(Unit*\
      \ who) override\n    {\n        if (IsLFR())\n        {\n            // Apply\
      \ LFR-specific behavior\n            DoCast(SPELL_LFR_ENERGY_BURN);\n      \
      \  }\n        else\n        {\n            // Standard raid behavior\n     \
      \       DoCast(SPELL_NORMAL_ENERGY_BURN);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the instance's difficulty settings and should only
    be called during active combat or when instance data is properly initialized.
    The LFR flag is typically set at instance creation time based on the dungeon's
    configuration in the database.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method outside of combat context or before the instance
    has been fully initialized, as it may return undefined behavior. Also note that
    LFR instances might have different loot tables and progression rules compared
    to normal or heroic raids.
