documentation:
  brief: Checks if player satisfies quest race requirements
  description: This method determines whether a player meets the race requirements
    specified in a quest. It evaluates the player's current race against the quest's
    required race, returning true if the requirements are satisfied and false otherwise.
    The method is commonly used during quest completion checks to ensure players meet
    the necessary criteria before accepting or completing quests. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining proper quest progression and game balance.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing race requirements to check
      against
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to display message if requirements
      are not met
  returns: Returns true if player satisfies quest race requirements, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->SatisfyQuestRace(quest, true)) {\n    // Player meets quest\
      \ race requirements\n    // Proceed with quest completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "bool result = player->SatisfyQuestRace(quest, false);\nif (result) {\n\
      \    // Player meets race requirements\n    // Continue with quest processing\n\
      } else {\n    // Player does not meet requirements\n    // Handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest completion checks and may be
    used in conjunction with other quest validation methods. Implementation relies
    on player's race data and quest's race requirement data.
  warnings: This method should not be used for direct quest acceptance without proper
    validation, as it only checks race requirements and not other quest conditions
    such as level or item requirements.
