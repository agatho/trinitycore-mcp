api:
  class: WorldSession
  method: GetSecurity
  signature: AccountTypes WorldSession::GetSecurity() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the security level of the account associated with this session.
  description: The GetSecurity method returns the AccountTypes enumeration value representing
    the security level assigned to the player's account. This security level determines
    what administrative privileges and access rights the player has within the game
    world. The returned value is typically used to control access to game commands,
    GM features, and other restricted functionality based on the account's permission
    level. The method performs no operations that would alter the session state and
    is safe to call at any time during a player's connection.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AccountTypes enumeration value indicating the security level of the
    account. Common values include SEC_PLAYER (0), SEC_MODERATOR (1), SEC_GAMEMASTER
    (2), SEC_ADMINISTRATOR (3), and SEC_CONSOLE (4).
  examples:
  - title: Check Player Security Level
    code: "if (session->GetSecurity() >= SEC_GAMEMASTER)\n{\n    // Allow access to\
      \ GM commands\n    SendGMMessage(\"Access granted for GM commands.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Command Access
    code: "void HandleSpecialCommand(WorldPacket& data)\n{\n    AccountTypes security\
      \ = session->GetSecurity();\n    if (security >= SEC_ADMINISTRATOR)\n    {\n\
      \        // Execute admin-only command\n        ExecuteAdminCommand(data);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Deny access\n        SendNotification(\"\
      Access denied.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The security level is determined during account login and is cached within
    the WorldSession object. This method does not perform any database queries or
    network operations, making it efficient to call frequently. The returned value
    reflects the account's current permissions and may change if the account's privileges
    are modified through in-game GM commands or database updates.
  warnings: Be cautious when using security checks in performance-critical code paths
    as they may be called very frequently. Ensure that all security checks properly
    validate against expected privilege levels to prevent unauthorized access to restricted
    features.
