  class: QuestLog
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void QuestLog::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner, const
    Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes quest creation data to a ByteBuffer for transmission to a player client.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes quest-related data into a ByteBuffer
    format suitable for sending to a player's client. This method is typically invoked
    when initializing or updating a player's quest log, ensuring that the client receives
    all necessary information about active quests. It handles serialization of quest
    state, objectives, progress, and other relevant metadata required by the World
    of Warcraft client to display quest information accurately. The method requires
    both owner and receiver player references to properly construct the data packet
    with appropriate context.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized quest creation data
      will be written. This buffer is populated with quest-related binary data that
      the client uses to render quest information.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the quest owner (typically
      the player who has accepted or is tracking the quest). Used to determine quest
      state and progress information.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this quest data. This
      parameter ensures proper client-side handling of quest information based on
      the receiving player's context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Creation Data Writing
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Player who owns the quest

      Player* receiver = ...; // Player receiving the quest update

      questLog.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send data to client via packet system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest synchronization mechanism in TrinityCore.
    It should only be called during quest initialization or updates when sending data
    to a player's client. The ByteBuffer must be properly initialized before calling
    this method, and the player pointers must not be null.
  warnings: Ensure that both owner and receiver player pointers are valid before calling
    this method, as dereferencing invalid pointers will cause crashes. This method
    modifies the provided ByteBuffer in-place, so make sure the buffer is cleared
    or appropriately managed before use.
