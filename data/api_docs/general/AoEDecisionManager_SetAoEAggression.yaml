documentation:
  brief: Sets the aggression state for area-of-effect decisions in the AI manager.
  description: The SetAoEAggression method configures whether the AI manager should
    apply aggressive behavior when making area-of-effect decisions. This setting affects
    how NPCs respond to threats and targets within their defined AoE ranges. When
    set to true, the AI will prioritize aggressive actions such as casting damaging
    spells or initiating combat in response to nearby enemies. When set to false,
    the AI may adopt a more defensive or passive approach to AoE interactions. This
    method is typically used during NPC behavior scripting or AI state management
    to dynamically adjust combat responsiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: aggressive
    description: Boolean value determining if AoE decisions should be aggressive (true)
      or non-aggressive (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Aggressive AoE Behavior
    code: 'AoEDecisionManager* aoeManager = ...;

      aoeManager->SetAoEAggression(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Aggressive AoE Behavior
    code: 'AoEDecisionManager* aoeManager = ...;

      aoeManager->SetAoEAggression(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the AI decision-making process for area-of-effect
    abilities and should be called carefully during appropriate AI state transitions.
    The change takes effect immediately for subsequent AoE decisions.
