documentation:
  brief: Handles and processes guild interaction errors for a specified player
  description: The HandleGuildInteractionError method is responsible for managing
    error conditions that occur during player interactions with guild systems in TrinityCore.
    This method takes a player's unique identifier and an error message string, then
    processes the error appropriately within the guild integration framework. The
    method likely dispatches the error to appropriate subsystems or logs it for debugging
    purposes, ensuring that guild-related operations can gracefully handle failure
    states without crashing the game server. It serves as part of the broader guild
    management system and is typically invoked when a guild operation fails due to
    permission issues, invalid data, or other runtime errors.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who encountered the guild
      interaction error. This value must be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore
      database system.
  - name: error
    description: A string containing the error message describing what went wrong
      during the guild interaction. This should be a human-readable description of
      the failure condition.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Handling Example
    code: 'GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.HandleGuildInteractionError(12345, "Player not in guild");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Logging with Player Context
    code: "void OnGuildJoinFailed(uint32 playerId) {\n    std::string errorMsg = \"\
      Failed to join guild: Insufficient permissions\";\n    guildIntegration.HandleGuildInteractionError(playerId,\
      \ errorMsg);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal guild integration system and should not
    be called directly from external modules unless properly integrated with the TrinityCore
    framework. It assumes that playerGuid refers to a valid online or offline player
    in the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the error message passed to this method is sanitized to prevent
    potential injection attacks or information disclosure if used in logging systems.
    The method does not validate whether the player GUID actually exists in the database
    before processing.
