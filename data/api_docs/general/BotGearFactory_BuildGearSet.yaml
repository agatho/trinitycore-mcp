  class: BotGearFactory
  method: BuildGearSet
  signature: GearSet BotGearFactory::BuildGearSet(uint8 cls, uint32 specId, uint32
    level, int faction)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a complete gear set tailored for a specified class, specialization,
    level, and faction.
  description: The BuildGearSet method generates a GearSet object containing appropriate
    equipment for a player based on their class, specialization, level, and faction.
    This method is typically used in bot or AI systems to automatically generate gear
    configurations that match the character's role and progression. The generated
    gear set includes weapons, armor pieces, and other relevant items that are appropriate
    for the specified class and level, while respecting factional restrictions. The
    method ensures that all items in the set are compatible with each other and follow
    game mechanics such as item level requirements, class-specific item types, and
    faction-based item availability.
  parameters:
  - name: cls
    description: The player's class identifier (e.g., WARRIOR = 1, PALADIN = 2, etc.).
      Valid values are defined by the TrinityCore class enumeration.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID for the character. This determines the specific
      build and gear priorities for the class. Specialization IDs vary per class and
      define different playstyles (e.g., Protection, Fury, Retribution for Warriors).
  - name: level
    description: The character's current level. Gear items are selected based on appropriate
      item levels for this level range. Must be within valid game level bounds (typically
      1-80).
  - name: faction
    description: The faction identifier (ALLIANCE = 0, HORDE = 1). Determines faction-specific
      items and ensures gear compatibility with the character's faction.
  returns: A GearSet object containing a complete set of equipment appropriate for
    the specified class, specialization, level, and faction. The returned GearSet
    includes all necessary slots filled with valid items that match the criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Generate a Warrior Protection Gear Set
    code: GearSet warriorGear = botGearFactory->BuildGearSet(WARRIOR, PROTECTION_SPEC,
      80, ALLIANCE);
    language: cpp
  - title: Create a Mage Fire Specialization Gear Set for Horde
    code: GearSet mageGear = botGearFactory->BuildGearSet(MAGE, FIRE_SPEC, 70, HORDE);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally uses item level progression tables and class-specific
    gear templates. It may perform database lookups or caching operations depending
    on the implementation. The GearSet returned should be immediately usable by bots
    for inventory management or gear optimization purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided class, specId, and faction values are valid to
    avoid undefined behavior. Invalid parameters might result in incomplete or incorrect
    gear sets. This method may not account for temporary buffs or gear modifications
    that occur during gameplay.
