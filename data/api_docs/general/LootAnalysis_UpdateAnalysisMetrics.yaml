  class: LootAnalysis
  method: UpdateAnalysisMetrics
  signature: void LootAnalysis::UpdateAnalysisMetrics(bool wasCacheHit, uint32 analysisTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics for loot analysis including cache hit status and
    analysis time.
  description: The UpdateAnalysisMetrics method is responsible for maintaining performance
    tracking data within the LootAnalysis class. It records whether a loot analysis
    operation resulted in a cache hit, which helps determine the efficiency of the
    loot system's caching mechanism. Additionally, it logs the time taken to complete
    the analysis, enabling developers to monitor and optimize performance. This method
    is typically called after completing a loot analysis operation to ensure accurate
    metrics are maintained for reporting and optimization purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: wasCacheHit
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the loot analysis resulted in a cache
      hit (true) or required a full analysis (false).
  - name: analysisTime
    description: The time in milliseconds taken to complete the loot analysis operation.
      Used for performance monitoring and optimization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LootAnalysis* analysis = new LootAnalysis();

      // Simulate a loot analysis that resulted in a cache hit

      analysis->UpdateAnalysisMetrics(true, 15);

      // Simulate a loot analysis that required full processing

      analysis->UpdateAnalysisMetrics(false, 42);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "void ProcessLoot(Loot* loot) {\n    LootAnalysis* analysis = GetLootAnalysis();\n\
      \    uint32 startTime = getMSTime();\n    \n    // Perform loot analysis\n \
      \   bool cacheHit = PerformLootAnalysis(loot);\n    \n    uint32 endTime = getMSTime();\n\
      \    analysis->UpdateAnalysisMetrics(cacheHit, endTime - startTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during loot processing operations.
    The metrics collected can be used for performance tuning and identifying bottlenecks
    in the loot system. It's important to note that this method does not directly
    affect gameplay mechanics but rather provides data for system optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that analysisTime values are accurate and represent actual processing
    time. Incorrect timing data may lead to misleading performance metrics. Avoid
    calling this method with negative values for analysisTime as it could cause unexpected
    behavior in performance tracking systems.
