  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastEbonMight
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastEbonMight(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Ebon Might spell on the specified target.
  description: The CastEbonMight method is responsible for executing the Ebon Might
    ability within the EvokerAI class. This ability typically provides a damage reduction
    or defensive buff to the target. The method takes an integer pointer as a parameter,
    which likely represents the target's identifier or index in the game world. It
    performs the necessary checks and triggers the spell cast animation and effects
    associated with Ebon Might. The implementation may include validation of the target's
    state and ensures the ability is not on cooldown before execution.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity for the Ebon
      Might spell. This value typically corresponds to a unit's GUID or index in the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastEbonMight
    code: 'EvokerAI* evoker = ...;

      int targetGuid = 12345;

      evoker->CastEbonMight(&targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely interacts with the TrinityCore spell system to properly
    handle cooldowns, mana costs, and visual effects. Developers should ensure that
    the target parameter points to a valid entity before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without validating the target may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target is alive and within the spell's range
    before invoking CastEbonMight.
