  class: Unit
  method: SetRace
  signature: void Unit::SetRace(uint8 race)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the race of the unit to the specified value.
  description: The SetRace method allows developers to change the racial identity
    of a Unit object, which is commonly used in World of Warcraft client-side scripting
    and server-side code. This method affects the unit's appearance and behavior within
    the game world, particularly when dealing with player characters or NPCs that
    have specific race-related attributes. The method typically requires a valid race
    identifier from the game's race database, and it may trigger updates to various
    game mechanics such as character creation, faction relationships, and visual representation.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The race identifier to set for the unit. This value must correspond
      to a valid race in the game's database, typically ranging from 1 to 10 for human,
      dwarf, gnome, etc., with some races having higher values depending on expansion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetRace(1); // Set to human race

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetRace(7); // Set to draenei race

      unit->SetRace(9); // Set to worgen race

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods like SetGender
    or SetDisplayId to fully customize a unit's appearance. It may also trigger updates
    to the unit's faction and related properties depending on how it's implemented
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect visual representation
    or behavior for units, especially if the race value is not valid or supported
    by the game. Care should be taken when setting race values for NPCs or players
    to avoid conflicts with existing game mechanics.
