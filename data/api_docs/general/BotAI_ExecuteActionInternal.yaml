api:
  class: BotAI
  method: ExecuteActionInternal
  signature: ActionResult BotAI::ExecuteActionInternal(Action * action, const ActionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a bot action internally within the AI system, processing the action
    and returning its result.
  description: The ExecuteActionInternal method is responsible for executing a given
    Action object within the BotAI framework. It takes an action and its context,
    processes it according to the bot's current state and logic, and returns an ActionResult
    indicating success, failure, or other outcomes. This method serves as a core component
    in the bot's decision-making loop, where actions are evaluated and executed based
    on the AI's current situation and priorities. The method typically integrates
    with the broader AI system to ensure that bot behavior remains coherent and aligned
    with intended gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: Pointer to the Action object that needs to be executed. This action
      defines what operation the bot should perform.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to an ActionContext object containing contextual information
      required for executing the action, such as target data or environmental factors.
  returns: Returns an ActionResult enum value indicating the outcome of the action
    execution. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, PENDING, or other status
    codes depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ActionResult result = botAI->ExecuteActionInternal(myAction, context);\n\
      if (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Handle successful action execution\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Action* action = new AttackAction(target);\nActionContext context;\ncontext.SetTarget(target);\n\
      ActionResult result = botAI->ExecuteActionInternal(action, context);\nswitch\
      \ (result) {\n    case ActionResult::SUCCESS:\n        // Action completed successfully\n\
      \        break;\n    case ActionResult::FAILED:\n        // Action failed, possibly\
      \ retry or log error\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle other\
      \ cases\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the bot's main AI loop and should
    not be invoked directly unless necessary. It assumes that the action and context
    are valid and properly initialized. The method may perform internal state updates
    or logging as part of its execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the Action object passed to this method is not null, as it
    could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be cautious about calling this method
    recursively or in a way that might cause stack overflow or deadlock.
