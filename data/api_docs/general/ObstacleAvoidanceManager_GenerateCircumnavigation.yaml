  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: GenerateCircumnavigation
  signature: AvoidanceManeuver ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GenerateCircumnavigation(const
    CollisionPrediction & collision)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a circumnavigation maneuver to avoid detected collisions.
  description: The GenerateCircumnavigation method computes and returns an avoidance
    maneuver that allows a unit to navigate around obstacles or predicted collision
    points. This method is typically invoked by the AI system when pathfinding detects
    potential collisions with static or dynamic objects in the environment. It evaluates
    the collision data provided through the CollisionPrediction parameter and calculates
    a safe, alternative path that avoids the obstacle while maintaining reasonable
    movement behavior. The resulting AvoidanceManeuver contains directional and positional
    information to guide the unit's movement during avoidance.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AvoidanceManeuver object representing the computed circumnavigation
    path. This maneuver includes details such as target position, movement direction,
    and duration required for safe passage around the obstacle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "AvoidanceManeuver maneuver = obstacleManager.GenerateCircumnavigation(collisionData);\n\
      if (maneuver.IsValid()) {\n    unit->MoveTo(maneuver.GetTargetPosition(), MANEUVER_DURATION);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the obstacle avoidance system and relies on accurate
    collision prediction data. Performance may be impacted if collision detection
    is not optimized, especially in densely populated areas with many dynamic obstacles.
  warnings: Ensure that the CollisionPrediction parameter contains valid and up-to-date
    collision data; otherwise, the generated maneuver may be invalid or unsafe. This
    method should only be called when collision is actually detected to avoid unnecessary
    processing.
