documentation:
  brief: Sets the caster unit for the aura creation info object
  description: The SetCaster method assigns a Unit pointer as the caster for an AuraCreateInfo
    object. This is used when creating auras to specify which unit is responsible
    for applying or casting the aura. The caster is essential for determining aura
    properties such as spell effects, duration, and ownership. This method returns
    a reference to the same AuraCreateInfo object, enabling method chaining for fluent
    interface patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the modified AuraCreateInfo object, allowing for method
    chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuraCreateInfo createInfo;

      Unit* caster = player;

      createInfo.SetCaster(caster);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: "AuraCreateInfo createInfo;\ncreateInfo.SetCaster(player)\n        .SetSpell(12345)\n\
      \        .SetDuration(30000);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the provided Unit pointer is valid
    or alive. It's recommended to ensure the caster unit exists before calling this
    method to prevent undefined behavior. The AuraCreateInfo object is typically used
    in conjunction with aura application functions within TrinityCore's spell and
    aura system.
  warnings: Passing a null Unit pointer may lead to crashes or undefined behavior
    when the aura is actually applied. Always validate that the caster unit is valid
    before setting it.
