  class: JoinedAppend
  method: JoinedAppend
  signature: void JoinedAppend::JoinedAppend(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a GUID to the joined append list for tracking player participation
    in group activities.
  description: The JoinedAppend method is used to add a player's unique identifier
    (GUID) to an internal tracking list that records which players have joined or
    participated in specific group events, such as raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds.
    This functionality is typically utilized by the TrinityCore server's group management
    and instance tracking systems to maintain accurate records of player involvement.
    The method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the JoinedAppend
    object to include the provided GUID. It is commonly called when a player successfully
    joins a group activity, ensuring that their participation is logged for future
    reference, loot distribution, or achievement tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who has joined a group
      activity. This value must be a valid player GUID from the TrinityCore database,
      typically retrieved using methods like GetGUID() on Player objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Join Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerJoinGroup(Player* player)\n{\n    uint64 guid = player->GetGUID();\n\
      \    JoinedAppend append;\n    append.JoinedAppend(guid);\n    // Player is\
      \ now tracked as having joined the group\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Instance Group Tracking
    code: "class GroupInstanceTracker\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerJoinInstance(Player*\
      \ player, uint32 instanceId)\n    {\n        // Log the player's join to this\
      \ instance\n        JoinedAppend append;\n        append.JoinedAppend(player->GetGUID());\n\
      \        \n        // Additional logic for tracking instance participation\n\
      \        m_instancePlayers[instanceId].push_back(player->GetGUID());\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger system for tracking group participation and
    should be used in conjunction with other methods that manage group state or instance
    data. The GUID parameter must represent an active player; otherwise, the behavior
    may be undefined. This functionality is critical for maintaining accurate group
    tracking in raid instances where loot distribution or achievement requirements
    depend on player presence.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or non-player GUIDs as it may lead
    to inconsistent state within the group tracking system. Ensure that the JoinedAppend
    object is properly initialized before calling this method, especially if it's
    part of a larger class or system.
