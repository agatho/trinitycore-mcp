  class: DynamicObject
  method: GetCreatorGUID
  signature: int DynamicObject::GetCreatorGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUID of the object that created this dynamic object.
  description: The GetCreatorGUID method returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    entity that spawned or created the current dynamic object. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, dynamic objects are typically created by spells or abilities
    and are associated with their caster or creator for tracking purposes. This GUID
    can be used to identify the originating player, creature, or game object. The
    method is const and does not modify any internal state of the dynamic object.
    It is commonly used in spell effects, combat systems, and object tracking logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the creator. This value corresponds
    to the unique identifier of the entity that created this dynamic object, typically
    a player or creature GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to identify spell caster
    code: "void HandleDynamicObjectUpdate(DynamicObject* dynObj)\n{\n    uint64 creatorGUID\
      \ = dynObj->GetCreatorGUID();\n    if (creatorGUID)\n    {\n        Player*\
      \ player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(creatorGUID);\n        if (player)\n \
      \       {\n            // Process the spell caster\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      Dynamic object created by player: %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n      \
      \  }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID may be zero if the dynamic object was not created by a
    valid entity. This method is safe to call from any thread context as it only reads
    immutable data members.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this GUID without validating that it points to
    an existing object, as invalid or expired GUIDs may cause crashes or undefined
    behavior if not properly checked.
