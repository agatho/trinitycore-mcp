  signature: void Battlefield::SetGraveyardNumber(int number)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the graveyard number for the battlefield.
  description: The SetGraveyardNumber method assigns a specific graveyard identifier
    to the battlefield instance. This number typically corresponds to a graveyard
    defined in the game's database and determines which graveyard players will be
    teleported to upon death during battlefield combat. The method is usually invoked
    during battlefield initialization or configuration phases. It directly affects
    the battlefield's behavior and player experience during active battles.
  parameters:
  - name: number
    description: An integer value representing the graveyard identifier to assign
      to this battlefield. This number must correspond to a valid graveyard entry
      in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Graveyard Number for Battlefield
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    bf->SetGraveyardNumber(5);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during battlefield setup or initialization.
    Changing the graveyard number during an active battlefield may cause inconsistent
    behavior for players already engaged in combat.
  warnings: Modifying the graveyard number while players are participating in the
    battlefield can lead to unexpected teleportation issues or player disconnection.
    Always ensure the specified graveyard number exists in the database before calling
    this method.
