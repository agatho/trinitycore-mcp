  method: SetThreatManager
  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::SetThreatManager(BotThreatManager *
    mgr)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the threat manager for role-based combat positioning.
  description: The SetThreatManager method assigns a BotThreatManager instance to
    the RoleBasedCombatPositioning class, enabling it to manage and utilize threat
    data for AI-driven combat positioning decisions. This method is typically used
    during initialization or when switching threat management strategies within the
    bot's AI framework. The assigned threat manager provides essential data about
    target aggro levels, enemy positions, and combat dynamics that influence how the
    bot positions itself in relation to threats.
  parameters:
  - name: mgr
    description: Pointer to a BotThreatManager instance that will be used for managing
      threat-related data and calculations within the role-based combat positioning
      system. Must not be null.
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioning;

      BotThreatManager* threatMgr = new BotThreatManager();

      positioning.SetThreatManager(threatMgr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot AI System
    code: "class MyBotAI {\npublic:\n    void InitializeCombatPositioning() {\n  \
      \      RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioning;\n        BotThreatManager* threatMgr\
      \ = GetThreatManager();\n        positioning.SetThreatManager(threatMgr);\n\
      \        // Further initialization...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct assignment without deep copying or reference
    counting. The caller is responsible for managing the lifetime of the BotThreatManager
    instance to prevent dangling pointers. It's recommended to call this method before
    any positioning calculations are performed.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always ensure that the BotThreatManager instance is properly
    initialized and valid before assignment.
