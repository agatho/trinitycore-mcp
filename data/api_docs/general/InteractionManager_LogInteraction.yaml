  signature: void InteractionManager::LogInteraction(Player * bot, const std::string
    & message) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs an interaction message associated with a player bot to the system's
    interaction log.
  description: The LogInteraction method records a specified message related to a
    player bot's activity within the TrinityCore framework. This function is typically
    used for tracking bot behavior, debugging interactions, or maintaining audit trails
    of automated player actions. The method takes a pointer to a Player object representing
    the bot and a string message describing the interaction. It does not return any
    value but performs an internal logging operation that may be persisted depending
    on system configuration. The method is marked as const, indicating it does not
    modify the state of the InteractionManager instance itself.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose interaction
      is being logged. Must not be null for valid operation.
  - name: message
    description: String containing the interaction message to be logged. Should describe
      the action or event related to the bot's activity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interaction Logging
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      std::string interactionMsg = "Bot purchased item from vendor";

      interactionManager.LogInteraction(myBot, interactionMsg);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Complex Interaction with Dynamic Message
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      uint32 itemId = 12345;

      std::string msg = "Bot interacted with item ID: " + std::to_string(itemId);

      interactionManager.LogInteraction(bot, msg);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's logging subsystem and may
    be configurable via core settings to determine verbosity or output destination.
    As a const method, it should not have side effects beyond the logging mechanism
    itself.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The message string should be
    sanitized if it contains user-generated content to prevent injection attacks.
