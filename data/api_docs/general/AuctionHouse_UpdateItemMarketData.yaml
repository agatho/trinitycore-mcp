  brief: Updates market data for a specific item in the auction house system.
  description: The UpdateItemMarketData method refreshes or recalculates the market
    statistics and pricing information for a given item within the auction house.
    This function is typically invoked when item prices fluctuate, inventory changes,
    or when new bids are placed. It ensures that the auction house maintains accurate
    real-time data for all items listed for sale, which affects both buyer decisions
    and seller strategies. The method may also trigger updates to related systems
    such as item caching, price tracking, or notification mechanisms.

  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item whose market data needs to be updated.
      This ID corresponds to entries in the game's item database and must reference
      a valid item that is currently listed on the auction house.
