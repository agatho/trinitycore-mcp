documentation:
  brief: Initializes the cooldown tracking system for Mage class abilities.
  description: The InitializeMageCooldowns method sets up internal data structures
    and state management for tracking cooldowns specific to Mage spells and abilities.
    This method is typically called during character initialization or when switching
    to the Mage specialization, ensuring that all Mage-specific cooldowns are properly
    registered and managed within the CooldownStackingOptimizer framework. It establishes
    baseline cooldown timers, prepares tracking mechanisms for spell interactions,
    and configures any necessary cooldown dependencies required for optimal Mage gameplay
    strategies.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeMageCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per character session or when Mage
    specialization is confirmed. It assumes that the underlying cooldown management
    system has already been initialized and that the character object is properly
    configured for Mage abilities.
