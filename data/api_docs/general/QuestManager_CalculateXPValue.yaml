  class: QuestManager
  method: CalculateXPValue
  signature: float QuestManager::CalculateXPValue(const Quest * quest) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the experience points value for completing a specified
    quest.
  description: The CalculateXPValue method computes the base experience reward that
    a player will receive upon completing a given quest. This calculation takes into
    account various factors such as the quest's level, difficulty, and any applicable
    modifiers within the TrinityCore framework. The returned float value represents
    the raw XP amount before any character-specific multipliers or bonuses are applied.
    This method is typically invoked during quest completion processing to determine
    the appropriate experience reward for the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point number representing the base experience points value that
    a player would receive for completing the quest. The value may be zero if the
    quest has no XP reward or if the calculation results in a null reward.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest XP Calculation
    code: 'Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      float xpReward = player->GetQuestManager()->CalculateXPValue(quest);

      // xpReward now contains the base XP value for quest 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not account for player-level differences, quest scaling,
    or any server-side XP multipliers that may be applied. The calculation is based
    purely on the quest template data and does not consider the player's current level
    or any active modifiers.
  warnings: The returned value should not be used directly as the final XP reward
    to a player, as additional calculations for player level differences and server
    bonuses are typically required. This method may return zero if the quest is invalid
    or has no XP associated with it.
