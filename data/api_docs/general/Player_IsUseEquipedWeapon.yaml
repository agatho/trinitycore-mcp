documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is using an equipped weapon.
  description: This method checks if the player is currently wielding a weapon in
    their main hand or off-hand slot. It returns true if the player has a weapon equipped
    in either hand, and false otherwise. The method is commonly used in combat scenarios
    to determine if a player's attack will be performed with a weapon or if they are
    using a melee weapon such as fists or a weaponless attack. This functionality
    is essential for determining the player's current attack state during combat operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has a weapon equipped in either main hand or
    off-hand, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsUseEquipedWeapon()) {\n    // Player is using a weapon\n\
      \    // Proceed with attack logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Player is not using a weapon\n\
      \    // Use default attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the player's current equipped items in their main hand
    and off-hand slots. It does not consider whether the weapon is actually being
    used for attacks, but rather checks if a weapon is equipped.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully during combat situations as it may
    affect attack logic and could lead to incorrect behavior if not properly handled
    in conjunction with other weapon-related methods.
