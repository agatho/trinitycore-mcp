  method: GetDeadlockThreshold
  signature: uint32 BotHealthCheck::GetDeadlockThreshold() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the deadlock threshold value used by the bot health check system.
  description: The GetDeadlockThreshold method returns the configured threshold value
    that determines when a bot is considered to be in a deadlock state. This value
    is typically used in conjunction with other health check mechanisms to identify
    and resolve situations where a bot becomes unresponsive or stuck in an infinite
    loop. The returned value represents the number of ticks or cycles after which
    a bot's activity is evaluated for potential deadlocks. This method is part of
    the BotHealthCheck class, which manages various aspects of bot behavior monitoring
    and system stability within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the deadlock threshold in ticks or cycles.
    This value indicates how many consecutive checks must fail before a bot is flagged
    as potentially deadlocked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 threshold = botHealthCheck.GetDeadlockThreshold();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Current deadlock threshold: {}", threshold);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Health Check Logic
    code: "if (bot->GetHealthCheck().GetDeadlockThreshold() > 0)\n{\n    uint32 currentTicks\
      \ = bot->GetHealthCheck().GetTickCount();\n    if (currentTicks >= bot->GetHealthCheck().GetDeadlockThreshold())\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle potential deadlock\n        bot->HandleDeadlock();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or configuration
    phases. The threshold value may be configurable through server settings or runtime
    parameters. Developers should ensure that the returned value is properly validated
    before use in critical system logic.
  warnings: The returned value should not be used directly for comparison without
    proper validation, as it might be zero or an unexpected value if the bot health
    check system hasn't been properly initialized.
