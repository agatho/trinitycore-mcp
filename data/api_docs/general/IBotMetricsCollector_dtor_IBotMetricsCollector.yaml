documentation:
  brief: Destroys the bot metrics collector instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the IBotMetricsCollector interface is responsible
    for cleaning up any resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This method
    ensures proper memory deallocation and prevents resource leaks when a bot metrics
    collector instance is no longer needed. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system,
    this typically involves releasing internal data structures used for tracking bot
    performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, or gameplay statistics.
    The destructor should be called automatically by the C++ runtime when the object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of bot metrics collector
    code: 'IBotMetricsCollector* collector = new BotMetricsCollector();

      // ... use the collector ...

      delete collector; // Triggers ~IBotMetricsCollector()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in an interface, ensuring that derived
    class destructors are properly called when deleting through a base pointer. Developers
    should ensure that no other objects hold references to the collector after deletion
    to prevent dangling pointers.
