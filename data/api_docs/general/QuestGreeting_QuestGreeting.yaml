documentation:
  brief: Displays a quest greeting with specified emote type, delay, and text to the
    player
  description: The QuestGreeting method is used to show a quest-related greeting message
    to a player in World of Warcraft through the TrinityCore server. This method allows
    for displaying custom text along with an emote animation and delay, which can
    be useful for quest introduction sequences or interactive NPC dialogue. The emote
    type determines what kind of animation is shown (such as talking, waving, etc.),
    while the emote delay controls how long the animation plays before the text appears.
    This method is typically called when a player interacts with an NPC that has quest-related
    content.
  parameters:
  - name: emoteType
    description: The type of emote animation to display (e.g., 1 for talk, 2 for wave).
      Valid values are typically defined in the game's emote database or constants.
  - name: emoteDelay
    description: The delay time in milliseconds before the text is displayed after
      the emote animation starts. This allows for timing between emote and dialogue.
  - name: text
    description: The actual quest greeting text to be displayed to the player. This
      can include quest descriptions or dialogue lines.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Greeting Usage
    code: "void OnGreet(Player* player)\n{\n    QuestGreeting(1, 1000, \"Hello there,\
      \ adventurer! I have a quest for you.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Quest Greeting with Dynamic Text
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    std::string\
      \ greetingText = \"Welcome to the quest: \" + quest->GetTitle();\n    QuestGreeting(2,\
      \ 1500, greetingText);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within NPC AI or quest handler code. The emote
    types and delays should match those defined in the TrinityCore database for proper
    functionality. The method does not return any value but directly affects the client's
    UI display.
  warnings: Ensure that the emoteType parameter corresponds to valid emotes in the
    game database, otherwise the animation may not display correctly or could cause
    errors. Be careful with large text strings as they might affect performance or
    client display limits.
