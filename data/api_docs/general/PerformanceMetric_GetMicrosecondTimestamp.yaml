  class: PerformanceMetric
  method: GetMicrosecondTimestamp
  signature: uint64_t PerformanceMetric::GetMicrosecondTimestamp()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current timestamp in microseconds since epoch.
  description: The GetMicrosecondTimestamp method retrieves the current time as a
    64-bit unsigned integer representing the number of microseconds elapsed since
    the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). This method is commonly used for
    performance measurement, logging, and timing operations within the TrinityCore
    server. The returned value provides high-resolution timing information suitable
    for benchmarking and profiling code execution. It's important to note that this
    timestamp is not adjusted for system clock drift or leap seconds, and it reflects
    the raw system time as reported by the operating system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64_t value representing the number of microseconds since Unix epoch
    (January 1, 1970). This value increases monotonically with each passing microsecond
    and can be used to calculate time differences between events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Timing
    code: 'uint64_t start = performanceMetric.GetMicrosecondTimestamp();

      // ... perform some operation ...

      uint64_t end = performanceMetric.GetMicrosecondTimestamp();

      uint64_t duration = end - start;

      TC_LOG_INFO("performance", "Operation took {} microseconds", duration);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Measuring Function Execution Time
    code: "void SomePerformanceCriticalFunction() {\n    uint64_t startTime = PerformanceMetric::GetMicrosecondTimestamp();\n\
      \    // ... critical code section ...\n    uint64_t endTime = PerformanceMetric::GetMicrosecondTimestamp();\n\
      \    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"performance\", \"Function executed in {} microseconds\"\
      , endTime - startTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented using high-resolution system timers
    and should provide consistent performance across different platforms. The returned
    value is suitable for measuring short durations with microsecond precision, but
    for very precise timing measurements, developers should consider the potential
    impact of system load and timer resolution on accuracy.
  warnings: Be aware that this timestamp may not be synchronized with other systems
    or network time sources. For applications requiring strict time synchronization,
    additional measures such as NTP synchronization should be considered. Also, in
    high-frequency performance measurement scenarios, repeated calls to this method
    may introduce minimal overhead due to system timer access.
