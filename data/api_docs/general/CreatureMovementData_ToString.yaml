documentation:
  brief: Converts CreatureMovementData object into a human-readable string representation
  description: The ToString method provides a formatted string output of all relevant
    movement data fields within the CreatureMovementData class. This method is primarily
    used for debugging, logging, and serialization purposes to give developers and
    administrators an easy way to inspect the current state of creature movement parameters.
    The implementation typically concatenates key properties such as movement type,
    speed values, waypoint information, and other relevant movement-related attributes
    into a single descriptive string. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe for repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the CreatureMovementData
    object's current state, including all relevant movement parameters and configuration
    values
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: 'CreatureMovementData movementData;

      // ... populate movementData with values ...

      std::string debugString = movementData.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Creature movement data: %s", debugString.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Unit Test Assertion
    code: 'CreatureMovementData expected;

      expected.SetMovementType(MOVEMENT_TYPE_WAYPOINT);

      expected.SetSpeed(3.5f);

      std::string result = creature->GetMovementData().ToString();

      ASSERT_TRUE(result.find("MOVEMENT_TYPE_WAYPOINT") != std::string::npos);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to be efficient and avoid expensive operations. It
    typically uses string streams or similar mechanisms to format the output. The
    exact format of the returned string may vary between different TrinityCore versions
    but generally follows a consistent pattern for readability.
