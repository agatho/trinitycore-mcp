documentation:
  brief: Deletes a guild from the game world if the player has sufficient permissions.
  description: The HandleGuildDelete method processes a client request to delete a
    guild. It verifies that the player issuing the command is the guild leader or
    has appropriate administrative privileges. The method performs validation checks
    to ensure the guild exists and that the player's session is valid before proceeding
    with the deletion. If all conditions are met, the guild is removed from the game
    world, including all associated data such as members, ranks, and guild achievements.
    This action is irreversible and affects all players within the guild.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Guild Deletion Request
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildDelete(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildDelete&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (!CanDeleteGuild())\n        return;\n    \n    // Proceed\
      \ with guild deletion logic\n    sGuildMgr->DeleteGuild(guildId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player has been verified as the
    guild leader or has administrative rights. The actual deletion process involves
    removing entries from multiple database tables including guild members, guild
    ranks, and guild events. It's important to ensure that no other operations are
    in progress for the guild during this time.
  warnings: This method permanently deletes all guild data. There is no undo functionality,
    so proper confirmation checks must be performed before calling this method. Additionally,
    attempting to delete a guild while it has active members or ongoing events may
    result in inconsistent state if not handled properly.
