  brief: Attempts to perform self-healing for the Holy Priest
  description: The HandleSelfHealing method represents a core functionality of the
    Holy Priest AI logic, designed to evaluate and execute self-healing spells when
    the priest's health falls below a certain threshold. This method typically checks
    the current health percentage of the priest and determines whether it is appropriate
    to cast a healing spell on themselves. It integrates with the overall AI decision-making
    process to ensure optimal resource usage and survivability during combat situations.
    The method may consider factors such as mana availability, spell cooldowns, and
    the urgency of healing required.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a self-healing action was successfully initiated or executed;
    returns false if no healing was performed due to insufficient resources, cooldowns,
    or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void HolyPriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      \    if (me->GetHealthPct() < 30.0f)\n    {\n        if (m_priest->HandleSelfHealing())\n\
      \        {\n            // Healing initiated\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the context of an AI update loop and
    should be used in conjunction with health checks to avoid unnecessary spell casting.
    The implementation may vary depending on specific spell priorities and cooldown
    management strategies.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called too frequently to prevent spamming
    healing spells, which can lead to resource waste or performance issues. Also verify
    that the priest's health state is properly evaluated before invoking this method.
