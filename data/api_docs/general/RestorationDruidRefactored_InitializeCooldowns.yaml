documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for restoration druid abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and resets the cooldown tracking
    for all relevant restoration druid spells and abilities. This method is typically
    called during player initialization or when switching to the restoration druid
    spec to ensure proper cooldown state management. It configures internal cooldown
    timers and prepares the druid's ability system for spell casting without interfering
    with existing gameplay mechanics or other class abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'RestorationDruidRefactored druid;

      druid.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during class initialization or spec
    switching to avoid resetting active cooldowns unnecessarily. The implementation
    assumes that the druid object has been properly constructed and initialized with
    valid spell data.
