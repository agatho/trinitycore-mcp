  signature: void InstanceMap::~InstanceMap()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InstanceMap object and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The InstanceMap destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all resources allocated to the instance map when it is destroyed. This includes
    releasing memory for objects within the map, removing references to the map from
    various subsystems, and ensuring that any pending operations or callbacks are
    handled appropriately. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this destructor ensures that instance-specific data and game objects are properly
    disposed of when an instance map is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks
    and maintaining system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of InstanceMap
    code: "void CleanupInstance()\n{\n    InstanceMap* map = new InstanceMap();\n\
      \    // ... perform operations on the map ...\n    delete map; // Triggers ~InstanceMap()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an InstanceMap object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this method should
    not be called directly unless you are certain about the object's lifecycle management.
