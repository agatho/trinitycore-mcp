  signature: uint16 FarmingCoordinator::GetTargetSkillLevel(int * player, ProfessionType
    profession) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the skill level of a specified player for a given profession.
  description: The GetTargetSkillLevel method fetches the current skill level of a
    player for a specific profession. It takes a pointer to a player object and a
    profession type as inputs, and returns the corresponding skill level as a uint16
    value. This method is typically used in farming-related systems where player skill
    levels affect crop yields, growth rates, or other agricultural mechanics within
    the game. The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose skill level is being retrieved.
      Must be a valid pointer to a Player instance; passing null may result in undefined
      behavior.
  - name: profession
    description: Enumeration value representing the profession type for which the
      skill level is requested. Should be a valid ProfessionType enum value such as
      PROFESSION_FARMING, PROFESSION_HERBALISM, etc.
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the player's current skill level in
    the specified profession. A value of 0 typically indicates no skill or unknown
    proficiency, while higher values indicate increasing levels of expertise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      uint16 skillLevel = farmingCoordinator.GetTargetSkillLevel(player, PROFESSION_FARMING);

      // skillLevel now contains the farming skill of the player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Skill-Based Crop Calculation
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint16 farmingSkill = farmingCoordinator.GetTargetSkillLevel(player, PROFESSION_FARMING);

      float yieldMultiplier = 1.0f + (farmingSkill / 100.0f); // Example calculation

      // Use multiplier to adjust crop yield based on skill level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object passed is valid and properly initialized.
    The profession type must be a supported value within the game's profession system.
    Performance-wise, this method should be relatively fast as it only accesses stored
    skill data without complex computations.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null player pointer may lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the profession type provided is valid and corresponds to
    a known profession in the game's database.
