documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for Death Knight abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking of a Death Knight's special abilities. This method
    is typically called during each AI update cycle to ensure that abilities are properly
    cooled down and ready for use when their cooldown periods expire. It handles the
    decrementing of cooldown timers based on the time elapsed since the last update,
    and may trigger ability availability checks or state transitions within the AI
    behavior system. The method operates on the internal cooldown data structures
    maintained by the DeathKnightAI class.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to accurately decrement cooldown timers and determine when abilities
      become available again.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateCooldowns Call
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n    \
      \    return;\n\n    // Other AI logic...\n    \n    m_deathKnightAI->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n    \
      \    return;\n\n    // Handle cooldown updates\n    m_deathKnightAI->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \    \n    // Check if abilities are ready to use\n    if (m_deathKnightAI->IsAbilityReady(SPELL_DEATH_GRIP))\n\
      \    {\n        // Use ability\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the AI update loop to maintain
    accurate cooldown tracking. The diff parameter must accurately reflect the time
    elapsed since the last call to ensure proper cooldown calculations. Cooldowns
    are typically managed internally and may involve multiple abilities with different
    cooldown durations.
  warnings: Failure to call UpdateCooldowns regularly will result in incorrect ability
    availability states. Ensure that the diff parameter is correctly calculated from
    the game loop timing to maintain accurate cooldown behavior.
