  method: TeleportTo
  signature: void Ticket::TeleportTo(Player * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Teleports the specified player to the ticket's location.
  description: The TeleportTo method is used to instantly transport a Player object
    to the location associated with this Ticket instance. This functionality is typically
    employed in game master (GM) tools or support systems where administrators need
    to quickly move players to specific locations for assistance, debugging, or administrative
    purposes. The method does not validate whether the player is online or if the
    destination is valid; it simply executes the teleportation using internal TrinityCore
    mechanisms. It's commonly used within GM command implementations or ticketing
    systems to facilitate quick player relocation.

  - title: Basic Usage in GM Command
    code: "void HandleTeleportTicketCommand(ChatHandler* handler, Ticket* ticket)\n\
      {\n    Player* player = handler->GetSession()->GetPlayer();\n    if (player\
      \ && ticket)\n    {\n        ticket->TeleportTo(player);\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Player teleported to ticket location.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal teleportation system of TrinityCore and
    may not work properly if the player is in a combat state or if server-side restrictions
    are active. The destination coordinates should be valid to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Using this method without proper validation can lead to players being
    teleported into invalid locations, such as solid objects or inaccessible areas.
    Ensure that ticket locations are properly validated before calling this method.
