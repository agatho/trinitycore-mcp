documentation:
  brief: Removes danger zones from the pathfinding manager that have expired based
    on the provided current time.
  description: The ClearExpiredDangerZones method is responsible for cleaning up outdated
    danger zones within the PathfindingManager. It iterates through all registered
    danger zones and removes those whose expiration time has passed relative to the
    provided current time parameter. This ensures that the pathfinding system does
    not consider obsolete danger zones when calculating paths for NPCs or players,
    maintaining accurate and up-to-date navigation data. The method is typically called
    periodically by the game loop or during cleanup operations to prevent memory bloat
    from stale danger zone entries.

  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\n    sPathfindingManager->ClearExpiredDangerZones(currentTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-critical as it's called frequently during game
    updates. It uses efficient container operations to remove expired entries without
    causing significant frame drops. The implementation likely uses a time-based comparison
    against stored expiration timestamps.
