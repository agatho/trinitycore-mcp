documentation:
  brief: Updates the preservation evoker's buff states and applies any necessary adjustments
    to the player's active buffs.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing the
    state of all active buffs associated with a preservation evoker class character.
    This includes checking for expired buffs, applying new buff effects, and ensuring
    that the player's current set of active buffs remains consistent with game mechanics
    and class-specific rules. The method typically runs during each update cycle of
    the evoker's AI behavior, ensuring that buffs are properly maintained throughout
    gameplay. It may also handle interactions between different buffs or trigger additional
    effects when specific buff conditions are met.

    code: "void EvokerAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    m_preservationEvoker->UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the evoker's AI update cycle,
    and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom behavior.
    The implementation may involve checking for buff expiration timers, recalculating
    stat modifiers, or triggering visual effects associated with active buffs.
