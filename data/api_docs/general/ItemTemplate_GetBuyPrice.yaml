documentation:
  brief: Returns the buy price of an item template.
  description: The GetBuyPrice method retrieves the base buying cost for an item as
    defined in its template. This value represents how much gold a player must pay
    to purchase the item from a vendor. The returned value is typically used in vendor
    transaction logic and may be modified by factors such as player reputation, faction
    discounts, or vendor-specific pricing adjustments. It does not account for any
    dynamic modifications that might occur during actual purchasing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the base buy price of the item in copper coins.
    This is the raw price from the item template and may differ from the final price
    paid by a player due to various modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Buy Price for an Item
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      uint32 buyPrice = itemTemplate->GetBuyPrice();

      TC_LOG_INFO("custom", "The buy price for item %u is %u copper.", 12345, buyPrice);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the static base buy price from the item template and
    does not factor in any dynamic adjustments like faction reputation bonuses or
    vendor-specific discounts. The value is stored in the database field 'buy_price'
    within the item_template table.
