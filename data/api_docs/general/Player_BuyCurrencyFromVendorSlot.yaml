documentation:
  brief: Buy currency from a vendor slot using the player's currency balance.
  description: This method allows players to purchase currency items from vendor slots
    by specifying the vendor GUID, vendor slot number, currency type, and quantity.
    It checks if the player has sufficient currency and handles the transaction accordingly.
    The method returns true upon successful purchase or false if the transaction fails
    due to insufficient currency or other constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The GUID of the vendor from which to buy currency items. This is
      typically a NPC's GUID.
  - name: vendorSlot
    description: The slot number in the vendor's inventory from which to purchase
      the currency item. Slot numbers are usually sequential starting from 0.
  - name: currency
    description: The currency type ID (e.g., 2147483648) representing the specific
      currency to purchase. This corresponds to a currency entry in the game database.
  - name: count
    description: The quantity of currency items to buy. This must be a positive integer
      value greater than zero.
  returns: Returns true if the transaction succeeds, indicating that the player successfully
    purchased the specified currency item from the vendor; otherwise returns false
    if the purchase fails due to insufficient currency or other invalid conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player;\nuint32 vendorGuid = 12345;\nuint32 vendorSlot = 0;\nuint32\
      \ currency = 2147483648;\nuint32 count = 1;\nbool result = player->BuyCurrencyFromVendorSlot(vendorGuid,\
      \ vendorSlot, currency, count);\nif (result) {\n    // Currency purchase successful\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core player interaction system and requires proper
    validation of currency balances before performing any transaction. It may involve
    multiple checks including inventory space availability, vendor slot validity,
    and currency balance.
  warnings: This method should not be used in situations where the player does not
    have sufficient currency to cover the purchase. Also, it is important to ensure
    that the vendor slot actually contains the desired currency item before calling
    this method.
