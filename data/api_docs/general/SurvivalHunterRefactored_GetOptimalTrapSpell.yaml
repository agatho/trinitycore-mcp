  signature: uint32 SurvivalHunterRefactored::GetOptimalTrapSpell() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal trap spell ID for a survival hunter based
    on current game state and available resources.
  description: The GetOptimalTrapSpell method evaluates the current state of a survival
    hunter character, including their available trap spells, resource levels (such
    as focus or energy), and combat situation. It selects and returns the most appropriate
    trap spell from the hunter's known abilities that would be most effective in the
    given context. This method is typically used by AI logic to make tactical decisions
    about when and which trap to deploy during combat encounters. The returned value
    represents a Spell ID that corresponds to a valid trap spell in the game's database,
    such as Freezing Trap, Snake Trap, or Ice Trap.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the Spell ID of the optimal trap spell available
    to the hunter. If no suitable trap spell is available, it may return 0 or a default
    invalid spell ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "uint32 trapSpellId = hunter.GetOptimalTrapSpell();\nif (trapSpellId !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Cast the optimal trap spell\n    caster->CastSpell(target, trapSpellId,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely considers factors such as spell cooldowns, mana/focus
    requirements, and target type to determine the optimal choice. It may also integrate
    with the hunter's current combat state or threat level.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned spell ID is validated before casting to avoid
    errors from invalid or unavailable spells. The method might not account for temporary
    buffs or debuffs that could affect trap effectiveness.
