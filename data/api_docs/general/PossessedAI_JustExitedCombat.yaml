documentation:
  brief: Handles cleanup and state management when a possessed creature exits combat.
  description: The JustExitedCombat method is called when a possessed AI creature
    (such as a player-controlled pet or summoned creature) leaves combat. This method
    performs necessary cleanup operations, resets internal AI states, and ensures
    the possessed unit returns to its normal behavior after combat has ended. It is
    typically invoked by the core combat system when the unit's combat state transitions
    from active to inactive. The method may also trigger any post-combat logic such
    as restoring movement, resetting target selection, or cleaning up temporary combat-related
    flags.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in custom AI implementation
    code: "class MyPossessedAI : public PossessedAI {\npublic:\n    MyPossessedAI(Creature*\
      \ creature) : PossessedAI(creature) {}\n\n    void JustExitedCombat() override\
      \ {\n        // Custom logic after exiting combat\n        PossessedAI::JustExitedCombat();\n\
      \        // Additional cleanup or state reset\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework and should be overridden in custom
    AI implementations to add specific behavior. It is automatically called by the
    TrinityCore engine during combat state transitions, so manual invocation is not
    required.
