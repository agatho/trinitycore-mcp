  method: AdaptCoordinationBasedOnHistory
  signature: void LootCoordination::AdaptCoordinationBasedOnHistory(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts loot coordination decisions based on historical player behavior and
    group dynamics.
  description: The AdaptCoordinationBasedOnHistory method modifies loot distribution
    strategies within a group by analyzing past loot coordination outcomes, player
    participation, and historical decision patterns. This method is typically invoked
    during group loot events to optimize fairness and efficiency. It evaluates each
    group member's contribution and previous loot decisions to influence current loot
    allocation logic. The method does not directly modify the loot items themselves
    but adjusts how loot is distributed among group members based on learned behavioral
    patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing members whose loot coordination
      history should be analyzed and adapted. Must be a valid group with at least
      one member, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: "void ProcessLootForGroup(Group* group)\n{\n    LootCoordination coordination;\n\
      \    coordination.AdaptCoordinationBasedOnHistory(group);\n    // Proceed with\
      \ loot distribution based on adapted strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with loot event handling
    code: "void HandleLootEvent(Group* group)\n{\n    if (group && group->GetMembersCount()\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        LootCoordination coordination;\n        coordination.AdaptCoordinationBasedOnHistory(group);\n\
      \        // Apply adapted coordination to current loot event\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of player loot history and group
    coordination data. It should only be called when the group state is stable and
    all members are properly initialized. The adaptation logic may include factors
    such as recent loot winners, participation frequency, and historical fairness
    metrics.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid group pointer will result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the group contains valid members before invoking
    this method to avoid potential crashes or incorrect loot distribution decisions.
