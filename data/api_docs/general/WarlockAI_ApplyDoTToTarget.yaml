  signature: bool WarlockAI::ApplyDoTToTarget(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a DoT effect to the specified target unit.
  description: The ApplyDoTToTarget method is used by the WarlockAI class to apply
    a Damage over Time (DoT) spell effect to a given target unit. This method typically
    handles the logic for selecting an appropriate DoT spell, checking if the target
    is valid, and ensuring the DoT can be applied without conflicts. It integrates
    with the warlock's AI behavior to manage spell casting priorities and cooldowns.
    The method returns true if the DoT was successfully applied, or false if the operation
    failed due to invalid targets, spell restrictions, or other game state constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the DoT effect was successfully applied to the target unit;
    otherwise returns false if the application failed due to invalid target, spell
    restrictions, or other conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ApplyDoTToTarget
    code: "if (warlockAI->ApplyDoTToTarget(targetUnit)) {\n    // DoT applied successfully\n\
      \    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"DoT applied to target {}\");\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to apply DoT\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Failed to apply DoT to target {}\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Warlock's AI system and assumes that the AI has
    already determined a valid target. It does not handle target selection or validation
    beyond basic checks. The actual spell application logic may involve internal cooldown
    tracking, spell range checks, and existing DoT conflict resolution.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is valid and alive before calling this method
    to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. This method should only be called
    from within a valid AI context where spell casting is allowed.
