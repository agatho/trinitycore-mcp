  signature: BankMetrics GuildBankManager::GetGuildBankMetrics(uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves bank metrics for a specified guild's bank
  description: The GetGuildBankMetrics method retrieves comprehensive banking statistics
    and usage metrics for a given guild's guild bank. This includes information about
    item counts, gold amounts, tab usage, and other relevant banking data. The method
    is typically used by the game server to track guild bank activity, enforce limits,
    and provide banking-related UI elements with accurate data. It accesses internal
    guild bank storage structures and aggregates the information into a structured
    BankMetrics object for consumption by various subsystems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BankMetrics object containing aggregated statistics about the guild's
    bank, including item counts, gold amounts, tab usage, and other banking-related
    metrics. Returns an empty BankMetrics structure if no guild bank exists for the
    specified guild ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Guild Bank Metrics
    code: "BankMetrics metrics = guildBankManager.GetGuildBankMetrics(12345);\nif\
      \ (metrics.totalItems > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Guild has \" << metrics.totalItems\
      \ << \" items in bank\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to gather all relevant guild
    bank data. It may cache results for performance reasons. The BankMetrics structure
    probably contains fields for item counts, gold amounts, tab usage statistics,
    and possibly timestamps or version information.
  warnings: The method assumes the guild ID parameter is valid and corresponds to
    an existing guild with a bank. No explicit error handling is documented, so calling
    this method with invalid guild IDs may result in undefined behavior or empty return
    values.
