  signature: float Guardian::GetBonusStatFromOwner(int stat) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns bonus stat value from the guardian's owner.
  description: The GetBonusStatFromOwner method computes a bonus stat value that is
    derived from the guardian's owner. This method is typically used in the context
    of pet or guardian AI to determine how much additional stat benefit (such as attack
    power, spell power, etc.) should be applied to the guardian based on its owner's
    attributes. The calculation may involve scaling factors, owner's stat values,
    and potentially other game mechanics such as pet bonuses or class-specific modifiers.
    This method does not modify any internal state but returns a calculated float
    value representing the bonus contribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the computed bonus stat contribution from the
    guardian's owner. The exact meaning of this value depends on the 'stat' parameter
    passed to the method, which is not part of the signature but is implied in the
    method name and usage context.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve bonus attack power from owner
    code: float bonusAP = guardian->GetBonusStatFromOwner(STAT_ATTACK_POWER);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that handles pet/guardian stat
    scaling. It may be called frequently during combat or stat recalculations, so
    performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios. The actual implementation
    details are not visible, but it's expected to use owner's stats and possibly class-specific
    multipliers.
  warnings: The method signature indicates it takes an 'int stat' parameter, but this
    is not present in the provided signature. This implies that either the method
    is overloaded or the documentation is incomplete. Ensure correct usage of the
    stat type enum when calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
