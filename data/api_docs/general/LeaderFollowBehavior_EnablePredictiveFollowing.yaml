  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: EnablePredictiveFollowing
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::EnablePredictiveFollowing(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables predictive following behavior for a leader-follower AI
    system.
  description: The EnablePredictiveFollowing method controls whether the LeaderFollowBehavior
    class uses predictive algorithms to anticipate the movement of the leader and
    adjust the follower's path accordingly. This feature enhances the realism and
    efficiency of group movement in World of Warcraft by allowing followers to proactively
    plan their paths rather than simply reacting to the leader's current position.
    When enabled, the behavior calculates predicted positions based on the leader's
    velocity and direction, enabling smoother and more natural-looking group dynamics.
    The method does not require any parameters beyond a boolean flag indicating the
    desired state.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value that determines whether predictive following is enabled
      (true) or disabled (false). When true, the AI will use predictive algorithms
      to anticipate leader movement; when false, it will follow the leader based on
      current position only.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Predictive Following
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = new LeaderFollowBehavior();

      behavior->EnablePredictiveFollowing(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Predictive Following
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = GetLeaderFollowBehavior();

      behavior->EnablePredictiveFollowing(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the internal pathfinding logic of the AI system. The
    predictive following algorithm considers factors such as the leader's movement
    speed, direction changes, and potential obstacles in the environment. Performance
    impact is minimal when enabled but may increase slightly during complex movement
    scenarios with multiple followers.
  warnings: Changing this setting while an AI unit is actively following a leader
    may cause temporary path recalculations that could appear jarring to players.
    It's recommended to set this before initiating group movement or during idle states.
