documentation:
  brief: Deposits the specified amount of gold into the player's account
  description: The DepositGold method transfers a given amount of gold from the player's
    inventory or currency pool into their account balance. This method is typically
    used in economy-related systems where players can deposit items or currency for
    various in-game transactions, such as auction house listings, bank deposits, or
    vendor interactions. The method performs validation to ensure the specified amount
    is positive and that the player has sufficient gold to cover the transaction.
    It returns true upon successful completion and false if the operation fails due
    to insufficient funds or invalid parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of gold to deposit, represented as a uint64 value. Must
      be greater than zero to perform a valid deposit.
  returns: Returns true if the gold was successfully deposited into the player's account;
    otherwise returns false if the operation fails due to invalid input or insufficient
    funds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gold Deposit
    code: "EconomyManager* economyMgr = player->GetEconomyManager();\nbool success\
      \ = economyMgr->DepositGold(1000); // Deposits 1000 gold\nif (success)\n{\n\
      \    // Gold successfully deposited\n    sLog->outString(\"Gold deposited successfully.\"\
      );\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to deposit gold\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed\
      \ to deposit gold.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Gold Deposit
    code: "EconomyManager* economyMgr = player->GetEconomyManager();\nuint64 amountToDeposit\
      \ = player->GetMoney() / 2; // Deposit half of player's money\nif (amountToDeposit\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    bool success = economyMgr->DepositGold(amountToDeposit);\n  \
      \  if (success)\n    {\n        player->ModifyMoney(-static_cast<int32>(amountToDeposit));\
      \ // Deduct from player's inventory\n        sLog->outString(\"Successfully\
      \ deposited %u gold.\", amountToDeposit);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the EconomyManager instance is properly initialized
    and associated with a valid player object. The method does not directly modify
    the player's money field but rather handles the internal accounting of gold deposits.
    It may be subject to server-side economy rules such as maximum deposit limits
    or currency conversion rates.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is validated before calling this method
    to prevent negative values or overflow issues. Improper handling of return values
    can lead to inconsistent player currency states and potential exploits in economy
    systems.
