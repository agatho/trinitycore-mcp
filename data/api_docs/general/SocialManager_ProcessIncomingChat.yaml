  class: SocialManager
  method: ProcessIncomingChat
  signature: void SocialManager::ProcessIncomingChat(Player * sender, const std::string
    & message, ChatType type)
documentation:
  brief: Processes an incoming chat message from a player, handling message validation
    and distribution to recipients.
  description: The ProcessIncomingChat method is responsible for validating and processing
    chat messages received from players in the game. It ensures that the message adheres
    to server rules and restrictions before forwarding it to appropriate recipients
    based on chat type. This method handles various chat types including general,
    whisper, guild, party, and raid channels. The method performs necessary checks
    such as message length limits, prohibited words, and player permissions before
    broadcasting the message. It also manages chat spam prevention mechanisms and
    ensures proper formatting of messages for display.
  parameters:
  - name: sender
    description: Pointer to the Player object who sent the chat message. This parameter
      identifies the source of the message and is used to verify permissions and apply
      appropriate restrictions.
  - name: message
    description: The actual text content of the chat message as a std::string. This
      contains the player's input that will be validated and processed according to
      server rules.
  - name: type
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of chat channel the message
      belongs to. Common values include CHAT_TYPE_SAY, CHAT_TYPE_WHISPER, CHAT_TYPE_GUILD,
      CHAT_TYPE_PARTY, etc., which determine where and how the message is distributed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic chat processing example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      std::string msg = "Hello everyone!";

      ChatType type = CHAT_TYPE_SAY;

      SocialManager::ProcessIncomingChat(player, msg, type);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Whisper message processing
    code: 'Player* sender = ...; // Get sender player

      Player* target = ...; // Get target player

      std::string whisperMsg = "Private message here";

      ChatType whisperType = CHAT_TYPE_WHISPER;

      SocialManager::ProcessIncomingChat(sender, whisperMsg, whisperType);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server's chat handling
    system. It performs validation checks that may include filtering for profanity,
    enforcing message length limits, and checking player permissions. The method may
    trigger additional events or callbacks related to chat processing. Performance
    considerations include message validation overhead and potential database lookups
    for recipient information.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to security vulnerabilities if input
    validation is bypassed. Developers should ensure that all parameters are properly
    validated before calling this method. The method may throw exceptions if critical
    validation fails, so proper error handling should be implemented in calling code.
