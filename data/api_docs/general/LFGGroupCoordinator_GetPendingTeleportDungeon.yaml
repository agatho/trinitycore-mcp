  signature: uint32 LFGGroupCoordinator::GetPendingTeleportDungeon(int playerGuid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the dungeon ID of the pending teleport for a specified player.
  description: The GetPendingTeleportDungeon method retrieves the unique identifier
    (Dungeon ID) of the dungeon that a player is currently pending teleportation to.
    This method is used in the LFG (Looking For Group) system to track which dungeon
    a player is about to be teleported into, typically after a group has been matched
    and is ready to enter a dungeon. The method takes a player's GUID as input and
    returns the corresponding dungeon ID if the player is in a pending teleport state.
    If no pending teleport exists for the specified player, it may return 0 or an
    invalid dungeon ID.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose pending teleport
      dungeon ID is to be retrieved. This should be a valid player GUID within the
      game world.
  returns: Returns the unique identifier (Dungeon ID) of the dungeon that the specified
    player is pending teleportation to. If no pending teleport exists for the player,
    or if the player is not found, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Check Pending Teleport Dungeon
    code: "uint32 dungeonId = lfgGroupCoordinator->GetPendingTeleportDungeon(playerGuid);\n\
      if (dungeonId != 0)\n{\n    // Player is pending teleport to this dungeon\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player %u is pending teleport to dungeon %u\", playerGuid,\
      \ dungeonId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No pending teleport for the player\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player %u has no pending teleport\", playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and is typically used in conjunction
    with other LFG methods to manage group matching and dungeon entry. It assumes
    that the player GUID provided is valid and corresponds to an active player in
    the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method is valid and refers
    to a currently logged-in player, as invalid or stale GUIDs may lead to unexpected
    behavior or errors. This method should not be called outside of the LFG context
    without proper validation.
