  method: GetAttackType
  signature: WeaponAttackType SpellInfo::GetAttackType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the attack type of the spell, determining whether it is a melee,
    ranged, or spell-based attack.
  description: 'The GetAttackType method retrieves the WeaponAttackType associated
    with a SpellInfo object, which defines the type of attack that a spell uses. This
    is crucial for understanding how spells interact with combat mechanics in World
    of Warcraft, particularly in relation to weapon types and attack patterns. The
    method returns one of three possible values: WeaponAttackType::MELEE, WeaponAttackType::RANGED,
    or WeaponAttackType::SPELL, depending on the spell''s configuration. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other methods like GetSpellDamageType() or GetAttackPower()
    to determine how a spell behaves during combat. This method does not require any
    parameters and is purely informational, returning the attack type as defined by
    the spell''s properties.'
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns one of three possible WeaponAttackType values: MELEE, RANGED,
    or SPELL. MELEE indicates that the spell uses a melee weapon (such as a sword
    or axe), RANGED indicates that the spell uses a ranged weapon (like a bow or gun),
    and SPELL indicates that the spell is a spell-based attack with no weapon involved.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellInfo* spellInfo = GetSpellInfo();\nWeaponAttackType attackType = spellInfo->GetAttackType();\n\
      if (attackType == WeaponAttackType::MELEE)\n{\n    // This spell uses a melee\
      \ weapon\n}\nelse if (attackType == WeaponAttackType::RANGED)\n{\n    // This\
      \ spell uses a ranged weapon\n}\nelse if (attackType == WeaponAttackType::SPELL)\n\
      {\n    // This spell is spell-based\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat calculations and spell mechanics.
    It should be noted that the attack type returned by this method does not necessarily
    reflect whether a spell will actually use a weapon during execution, but rather
    defines how the spell interacts with the game's combat system. Performance-wise,
    this method is lightweight and does not involve any complex computations.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with GetSpellDamageType(), which returns
    the damage type of a spell. Also, be aware that some spells may have multiple
    attack types depending on their configuration or context, though this is rare
    in practice.
