  method: SaveWeights
  signature: void NeuralNetwork::SaveWeights(const std::string & filename) const
documentation:
  brief: Saves the neural network's current weight values to a specified file.
  description: The SaveWeights method serializes the current state of the neural network's
    weights and stores them in a file identified by the provided filename. This functionality
    is typically used for persisting trained model data so that it can be loaded at
    a later time without retraining. The saved weights represent the learned parameters
    of the neural network which are crucial for making predictions or classifications.
    This method does not modify the internal state of the neural network object itself,
    but rather creates an external representation of its current configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: filename
    description: The path and name of the file where the weights will be saved. Must
      be a valid file path with write permissions. The file format is typically binary
      or text-based depending on implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'NeuralNetwork nn;

      // ... train the network ...

      nn.SaveWeights("trained_weights.dat");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Saving Weights with Error Handling
    code: "NeuralNetwork nn;\ntry {\n    nn.SaveWeights(\"./data/network_weights.bin\"\
      );\n    printf(\"Weights saved successfully\\n\");\n} catch (const std::exception&\
      \ e) {\n    fprintf(stderr, \"Failed to save weights: %s\\n\", e.what());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the file system is accessible and that appropriate
    write permissions exist for the specified path. It may throw exceptions if the
    file cannot be written or if the network has not been initialized with valid weights.
    The saved data format should be compatible with the corresponding LoadWeights
    method.
  warnings: Ensure that the filename parameter points to a valid location where the
    application has write access. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten
    without warning. This operation may block execution until the file I/O is complete.
