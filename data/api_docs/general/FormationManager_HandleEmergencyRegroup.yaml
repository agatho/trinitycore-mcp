  class: FormationManager
  method: HandleEmergencyRegroup
  signature: void FormationManager::HandleEmergencyRegroup(const int & rallyPoint)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an emergency regrouping of units toward a specified rally point
    in the FormationManager.
  description: The HandleEmergencyRegroup method is responsible for executing an immediate
    tactical repositioning of all units managed by the FormationManager. This function
    typically triggers when a critical situation arises, such as when a unit is under
    attack or needs to quickly consolidate its position. It moves all participating
    units toward the designated rally point, overriding any existing formation behavior
    temporarily. The method ensures that units return to a safe and coordinated location
    while maintaining their tactical integrity. Precondition for this method is that
    the FormationManager must be initialized with valid units and a valid rally point
    coordinate should be provided.
  parameters:
  - name: rallyPoint
    description: An integer value representing the rally point identifier or coordinate
      where all units will regroup. This parameter determines the destination for
      the emergency movement of all managed units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Regroup Usage
    code: 'FormationManager* fm = sObjectAccessor->GetFormationManager();

      fm->HandleEmergencyRegroup(1001); // Move all units to rally point 1001'
    language: cpp
  - title: Emergency Regroup with Dynamic Rally Point
    code: 'int dynamicRallyPoint = GetDynamicRallyPoint();

      FormationManager* fm = sObjectAccessor->GetFormationManager();

      fm->HandleEmergencyRegroup(dynamicRallyPoint); // Move units to dynamically
      calculated rally point'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for high-priority tactical actions and may interrupt
    ongoing movement or combat behaviors. It is recommended to validate the rallyPoint
    parameter before calling this method to ensure that it corresponds to a valid
    location within the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the FormationManager
    or an invalid rallyPoint value can lead to undefined behavior or unit movement
    errors. Ensure all units are in a state where they can be moved before invoking
    this function.
