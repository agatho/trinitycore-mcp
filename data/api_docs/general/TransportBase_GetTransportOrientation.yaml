  method: GetTransportOrientation
  signature: float TransportBase::GetTransportOrientation() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current orientation angle of the transport entity in radians.
  description: The GetTransportOrientation method retrieves the angular orientation
    of a transport object within the game world. This value represents the direction
    the transport is facing, measured in radians from the positive X-axis (typically
    east). The orientation is used for calculating positions relative to the transport
    and determining how passengers are positioned and oriented while aboard. This
    method is commonly used in conjunction with other transport-related functions
    to manage movement and positioning of players and objects on moving transports
    such as boats, zeppelins, or other vehicle-based transports.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the orientation angle of the transport in radians.
    The value typically ranges from 0.0 to 2*PI (approximately 6.283), where 0.0 represents
    east, PI/2 represents north, PI represents west, and 3*PI/2 represents south.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float orientation = transport->GetTransportOrientation();

      // Use the orientation to calculate relative positions or determine facing direction'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Orientation for Position Calculation
    code: 'float currentOrientation = transport->GetTransportOrientation();

      float x = transport->GetPositionX() + cos(currentOrientation) * distanceFromCenter;

      float y = transport->GetPositionY() + sin(currentOrientation) * distanceFromCenter;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the orientation as a normalized radian value. The implementation
    internally handles angle wrapping to ensure consistent values between 0 and 2*PI.
    This method is typically called frequently during transport movement updates,
    so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned orientation value may change dynamically as
    the transport moves or turns. If you need a stable reference point for calculations,
    consider caching the value at specific moments rather than calling this method
    repeatedly in tight loops.
