documentation:
  brief: Returns the class ID of the player in the who list entry
  description: The GetClass method retrieves the class identifier of a player as stored
    in the WhoListPlayerInfo structure. This value corresponds to the standard World
    of Warcraft class enumeration where each class is assigned a unique numeric ID.
    The returned value can be used to determine the player's character class for display
    purposes or game logic processing within the who list functionality. This method
    is typically called on player entries retrieved from the server's who list system,
    which aggregates information about online players for the /who command.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A uint8 value representing the player''s class ID according to the World
    of Warcraft class enumeration system. Valid values range from 1-12 corresponding
    to: Warrior (1), Paladin (2), Hunter (3), Rogue (4), Priest (5), Death Knight
    (6), Shaman (7), Mage (8), Warlock (9), Monk (10), Druid (11), and Evoker (12).'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Who List Processing
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// ... populate playerInfo from who list\
      \ ...\nuint8 playerClass = playerInfo.GetClass();\nswitch (playerClass)\n{\n\
      \    case CLASS_WARRIOR:\n        std::cout << \"Warrior\" << std::endl;\n \
      \       break;\n    case CLASS_MAGE:\n        std::cout << \"Mage\" << std::endl;\n\
      \        break;\n    // ... other cases ...\n}"

  - title: Filtering Players by Class in Who List
    code: "std::vector<WhoListPlayerInfo> whoList;\n// ... populate whoList ...\n\
      std::vector<WhoListPlayerInfo> mages;\nfor (const auto& player : whoList)\n\
      {\n    if (player.GetClass() == CLASS_MAGE)\n    {\n        mages.push_back(player);\n\
      \    }\n}\nstd::cout << \"Found \" << mages.size() << \" mages in who list\"\
      \ << std::endl;"

  notes: This method provides direct access to the raw class ID stored in the WhoListPlayerInfo
    structure. Developers should be aware that the returned value is not validated
    against known class constants and may contain unexpected values if the data source
    is corrupted or modified. The method is thread-safe as it only reads from a const
    member variable.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the raw uint8 return value without proper validation,
    as invalid class IDs could indicate corrupted data or unexpected behavior in the
    who list system. Ensure that any logic depending on this value handles all possible
    class ID values appropriately.
