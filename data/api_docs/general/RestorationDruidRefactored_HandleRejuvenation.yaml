  class: RestorationDruidRefactored
  method: HandleRejuvenation
  signature: bool RestorationDruidRefactored::HandleRejuvenation(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Applies or updates the Rejuvenation spell effect on a target within the specified
    group.
  description: The HandleRejuvenation method is responsible for managing the Rejuvenation
    spell logic for a Restoration Druid class. It determines whether to apply a new
    Rejuvenation buff or refresh an existing one on a target within the given group.
    This method typically checks if the target is valid, verifies that the caster
    has sufficient mana, and ensures the spell can be cast according to game rules.
    The method also handles the application of healing over time effects and updates
    the spell's duration and tick intervals based on the druid's level and any relevant
    buffs or debuffs.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group of targets to apply Rejuvenation
      to. This parameter determines the scope of the spell effect, typically representing
      a specific raid or party member index.
  returns: Returns true if the Rejuvenation spell was successfully applied or refreshed
    on the target; otherwise returns false if the spell failed to apply due to invalid
    targets, insufficient resources, or other game constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (druid->HandleRejuvenation(0)) {\n    // Rejuvenation successfully applied\n\
      \    SendChatMessage(\"Rejuvenation applied to target.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Group Validation
    code: "int groupIndex = GetGroupMemberIndex(player);\nif (groupIndex >= 0 && druid->HandleRejuvenation(groupIndex))\
      \ {\n    // Apply Rejuvenation to the correct group member\n    player->AddAura(SPELL_REJUVENATION,\
      \ target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the spell system and aura management components
    of TrinityCore. It may also integrate with cooldown tracking and mana cost calculations
    for Druid abilities. The group parameter is assumed to be a zero-based index that
    maps to specific targets in the player's party or raid.
  warnings: Ensure that the target specified by 'group' is valid and alive before
    calling this method, as applying Rejuvenation to invalid targets may cause unexpected
    behavior or crashes. Also verify that sufficient mana is available before attempting
    to cast.
