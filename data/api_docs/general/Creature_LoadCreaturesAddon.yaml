  class: Creature
  method: LoadCreaturesAddon
  signature: bool Creature::LoadCreaturesAddon()
documentation:
  brief: Loads addon data for the creature from the database.
  description: The LoadCreaturesAddon method retrieves and initializes addon-specific
    data for a Creature instance from the database. This includes information such
    as the creature's movement patterns, AI behavior settings, and other extended
    properties that are not part of the base creature template. The method ensures
    that all addon-related data is properly loaded and applied to the creature object
    before it becomes active in the game world. It typically gets called during the
    creature's initialization phase when the object is being spawned or reloaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the addon data was successfully loaded and applied, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate database errors, missing records,
    or failed data processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in creature spawning
    code: "Creature* creature = new Creature();\nif (creature->LoadCreaturesAddon())\
      \ {\n    // Addon data loaded successfully\n    creature->SetUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS,\
      \ creature->GetUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS) | UNIT_FLAG_NON_ATTACKABLE);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle failed addon load\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to load\
      \ addon data for creature %u\", creature->GetEntry());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the Creature's initialization process,
    often after the base creature data has been loaded but before the creature is
    fully integrated into the world. The method may perform database queries to fetch
    addon-specific information and apply it to internal member variables of the Creature
    class.
  warnings: Calling this method on a creature that has already had its addon data
    loaded may result in overwriting existing data or undefined behavior. It's important
    to ensure this method is only called once per creature instance during initialization.
