  method: Update
  signature: void GuildBankManager::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the guild bank manager's internal state based on the elapsed time
    delta.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of the guild bank system. It handles time-based operations such as cooldowns,
    maintenance tasks, or synchronization of bank data with the game world. This method
    is typically called by the game loop at regular intervals to ensure that the guild
    bank remains consistent with in-game events and player actions. The method uses
    the provided time delta (diff) parameter to determine how much time has passed
    since the last update, which is essential for accurate timing of any time-sensitive
    operations within the guild bank system.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = GetTimeDiff();\n    guildBankManager.Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly by the game's main update loop to
    ensure proper synchronization of guild bank data. The implementation likely handles
    tasks such as updating item cooldowns, processing pending transactions, or maintaining
    database consistency.
