documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes NPC spell click spells from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadNPCSpellClickSpells method retrieves all NPC spell click spell
    entries from the database table 'npc_spellclick_spells' and populates internal
    data structures for use during runtime. This method is typically called during
    server startup or reload operations to ensure that all spell click interactions
    between NPCs and players are properly configured. It processes the spell click
    data, validates the associated spells and NPCs, and prepares them for activation
    when players interact with clickable NPCs. The method does not return any value
    but modifies internal state within the ObjectMgr class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    sObjectMgr->LoadNPCSpellClickSpells();\n    // Continue with other initialization...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup or database reloads.
    It assumes that the database connection is already established and that the 'npc_spellclick_spells'
    table exists with proper structure. The method performs validation on spell and
    NPC IDs to ensure they exist in their respective tables before storing them.
  warnings: Improperly configured entries in the npc_spellclick_spells table may lead
    to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when players interact with NPCs. Ensure
    that all referenced spell and creature IDs are valid and exist in their corresponding
    database tables.
