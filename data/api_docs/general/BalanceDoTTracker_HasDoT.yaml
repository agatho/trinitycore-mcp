  class: BalanceDoTTracker
  method: HasDoT
  signature: bool BalanceDoTTracker::HasDoT(int guid, uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified target has a DoT spell active on them.
  description: The HasDoT method determines if a given unit (identified by GUID) currently
    has a Damage over Time (DoT) spell applied to it. This is commonly used in balance
    druid AI logic to track the status of harmful spells like Moonfire or Insect Swarm.
    The method performs a lookup in an internal tracking structure that maintains
    active DoT effects per target. It returns true if the specified spell is currently
    active on the target, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for spell
    rotation and resource management in combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to check for active
      DoT spells.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the specific spell to verify is currently active on the
      target as a DoT effect.
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell is currently active as a DoT on the
    target with the given GUID; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (balanceDoTTracker.HasDoT(targetGuid, SPELL_MOONFIRE))\n{\n    // Moonfire\
      \ is currently active on the target\n    // Perform alternative action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Decision Making
    code: "Unit* target = GetVictim();\nif (target && !balanceDoTTracker.HasDoT(target->GetGUID(),\
      \ SPELL_INSECT_SWARM))\n{\n    // Insect Swarm is not active, cast it\n    DoCast(SPELL_INSECT_SWARM);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of DoT effects. It assumes
    that the BalanceDoTTracker instance has been properly initialized with active
    DoT data. The implementation likely uses a map or similar data structure to store
    spell IDs per target GUID for efficient lookup.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID and spellId parameters are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    This method should only be called during active combat situations where DoT tracking
    is relevant.
