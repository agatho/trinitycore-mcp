  method: IsRangedAttacker
  signature: bool PlayerAI::IsRangedAttacker(const int * who) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is a ranged attacker.
  description: The IsRangedAttacker method checks if the current player character
    is classified as a ranged attacker. This determination is typically based on the
    player's equipped weapon type and class-specific abilities. The method returns
    true if the player can perform ranged attacks, such as those using bows, guns,
    or wands, and false otherwise. It is commonly used in AI logic to decide attack
    behavior and spell casting patterns for player-controlled creatures or NPCs that
    mimic player actions.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Optional pointer to an integer representing the target entity ID.
      If provided, the method checks if the specified target is a ranged attacker
      rather than the current player.
  returns: Returns true if the player (or specified target) is classified as a ranged
    attacker, indicating they use ranged weapons or abilities; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if player is a ranged attacker
    code: "if (playerAI->IsRangedAttacker()) {\n    // Player can perform ranged attacks\n\
      \    playerAI->CastSpell(target, RANGED_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if a specific target is a ranged attacker
    code: "uint32 targetId = 12345;\nif (playerAI->IsRangedAttacker(&targetId)) {\n\
      \    // Target is a ranged attacker\n    playerAI->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal player state tracking related to weapon type
    and class specialization. It may not reflect real-time changes in equipment unless
    the AI system is updated accordingly. The method does not account for temporary
    buffs or debuffs that might alter a character's attack type.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'who' parameter points to valid memory; passing an invalid
    pointer can lead to undefined behavior. The method should only be called when
    the player AI context is properly initialized and active.
