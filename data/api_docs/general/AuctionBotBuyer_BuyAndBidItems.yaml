  class: AuctionBotBuyer
  method: BuyAndBidItems
  signature: void AuctionBotBuyer::BuyAndBidItems(BuyerConfiguration & config)
documentation:
  brief: Processes auction item purchases and bids based on configured buyer settings.
  description: The BuyAndBidItems method executes the core logic for purchasing and
    placing bids on auction house items within the AuctionBot system. It evaluates
    the current auction listings against the provided buyer configuration, determines
    which items meet the criteria for purchase or bidding, and performs the necessary
    transactions. This method is typically invoked as part of the automated auction
    bot's periodic scanning cycle to maintain active participation in the auction
    market. The behavior is influenced by various configuration parameters such as
    price thresholds, item quality requirements, and bid strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: Reference to a BuyerConfiguration object that defines the rules and
      constraints for purchasing and bidding actions. This includes parameters like
      maximum bid amounts, item type filters, quality thresholds, and other buyer-specific
      settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AuctionBotBuyer buyer;

      BuyerConfiguration config;

      // Configure the buyer settings

      config.maxBidAmount = 1000000; // 10g

      config.itemQualityFilter = ITEM_QUALITY_RARE;

      buyer.BuyAndBidItems(config);'

  notes: This method operates within the context of TrinityCore's auction house system
    and requires proper initialization of the AuctionBot framework. It may perform
    multiple database operations and network calls during execution, which can impact
    performance if called too frequently.
  warnings: Improper configuration of buyer settings may result in unintended purchases
    or excessive bidding. The method assumes that the auction house data is consistent
    and up-to-date. Care should be taken when configuring bid strategies to avoid
    overpaying for items.
