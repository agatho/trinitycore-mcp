  brief: Calculates and applies percentage-based healing effect for spell
  description: This method performs the calculation and application of a percentage-based
    healing effect within the Spell class. It typically handles scenarios where healing
    is based on a percentage of the target's maximum health, such as in certain abilities
    or spells that utilize this mechanic. The method ensures proper handling of the
    healing calculation, including applying the calculated heal to the target while
    considering various factors like spell modifiers and target health status.
