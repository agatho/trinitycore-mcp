documentation:
  brief: Updates the frost state of the mage, including spell effects, cooldowns,
    and aura management.
  description: The UpdateFrostState method is responsible for managing and synchronizing
    all frost-related game states for a Frost Mage class instance. This includes updating
    active frost spells, handling cooldown timers, refreshing or removing frost auras,
    and ensuring proper state transitions between different frost mechanics such as
    Ice Block, Frost Nova, and Winter's Chill. The method typically runs during the
    AI update cycle to maintain consistent spell behavior and player status. It ensures
    that the mage's frost abilities are properly tracked and that any state changes
    are accurately reflected in the game world.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI framework during each
    update cycle. Developers should ensure that all frost-related spell effects are
    properly initialized before calling this method. The method may trigger additional
    state changes or event notifications depending on the current frost state.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the proper AI update context may result
    in inconsistent spell states or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all prerequisite
    conditions for frost abilities are met before invoking this method.
