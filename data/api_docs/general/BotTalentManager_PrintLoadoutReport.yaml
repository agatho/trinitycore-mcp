documentation:
  brief: Prints a detailed talent loadout report for all bot characters managed by
    this manager.
  description: The PrintLoadoutReport method generates and outputs a comprehensive
    talent specialization report for every bot character under the management of the
    BotTalentManager. This function iterates through all registered bots, retrieves
    their current talent point allocations and specialization choices, and formats
    this information into a human-readable report that can be used for debugging,
    analysis, or performance evaluation purposes. The output typically includes bot
    identifiers, class information, talent tree selections, and any relevant configuration
    settings related to their talent builds. This method is primarily intended for
    administrative or development use within the TrinityCore framework.

  notes: This method performs operations on all managed bots synchronously and may
    have performance implications when dealing with a large number of bots. It is
    recommended to use this function primarily in development or administrative contexts
    rather than in high-frequency game loops.
