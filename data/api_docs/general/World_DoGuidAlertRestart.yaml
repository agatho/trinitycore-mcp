    invoked when a server restart or configuration change requires the re-establishment
    of GUID tracking alerts. It ensures that all players receive updated GUID-related
    notifications and that the internal alert state is properly reset for accurate
    tracking of object identifiers within the game world.

  notes: This method should only be called during server maintenance or configuration
    updates to avoid disrupting active gameplay. It may cause temporary delays in
    GUID alert delivery until all connections are properly reinitialized.
  warnings: Calling this method during high-traffic periods may result in temporary
    disconnections or delayed alerts for players. Ensure that the server is not under
    heavy load when invoking this function.
