  method: CanUseFreeSpender
  signature: bool HolyPowerResource::CanUseFreeSpender() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a free spender ability can be used based on current holy
    power resource state.
  description: The CanUseFreeSpender method evaluates if the player is currently able
    to use a free spender ability, which typically refers to abilities that consume
    holy power without requiring additional resource expenditure. This check considers
    the current amount of holy power available and any restrictions or conditions
    that might prevent usage. The method is commonly used in spell processing and
    ability validation logic within the TrinityCore framework to ensure proper game
    mechanics adherence for paladin holy power-based abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a free spender ability can be used with current holy power
    resources; otherwise returns false when usage is restricted or not possible due
    to insufficient resources or other game state conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetHolyPowerResource()->CanUseFreeSpender()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with free spender ability execution\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_HOLY_SPARK,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Validation
    code: "class PaladinSpellHandler {\npublic:\n    bool ValidateAndExecuteFreeSpender(Player*\
      \ player, uint32 spellId) {\n        HolyPowerResource* holyPower = player->GetHolyPowerResource();\n\
      \        if (holyPower && holyPower->CanUseFreeSpender()) {\n            //\
      \ Execute the free spender spell\n            return player->CastSpell(player->GetSelectedUnit(),\
      \ spellId, true);\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal holy power tracking systems and
    may be called during spell preparation or execution phases. It's important to
    note that this check does not modify the holy power resource state; it only evaluates
    whether usage is permitted.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is called in appropriate contexts where holy power
    state should be validated before ability activation. Improper use may lead to
    incorrect gameplay behavior or violation of spell restrictions.
