  notes: The method typically requires a valid player target and proper spell data.
    Implementation may involve checking if the player already knows the skill, or
    if the skill is learnable through the spell effect.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the spell's effect type is set
    to LearnSkill. Improper usage can lead to incorrect skill progression or missing
    skill points.
