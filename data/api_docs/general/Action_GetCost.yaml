documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the cost of executing this action within the bot's
    AI context.
  description: The GetCost method computes the resource cost associated with performing
    a specific action in the context of a bot's AI system. This cost typically represents
    the effort or resources required to execute the action, such as mana, energy,
    or time. The method takes into account various factors like the bot's current
    state, available resources, and the nature of the action itself. It is commonly
    used by the AI decision-making process to evaluate which actions are most viable
    given the bot's constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the cost of executing this action. Lower values
    indicate less costly actions, while higher values suggest more expensive or resource-intensive
    actions. The exact scale and interpretation of the cost value depends on the specific
    implementation within the AI framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "float cost = action->GetCost(ai);\nif (cost < 10.0f) {\n    // Execute\
      \ the action since it's cheap enough\n    ai->ExecuteAction(action);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Action Costs for Decision Making
    code: "Action* bestAction = nullptr;\nfloat lowestCost = FLT_MAX;\nfor (auto&\
      \ action : availableActions) {\n    float cost = action->GetCost(ai);\n    if\
      \ (cost < lowestCost) {\n        lowestCost = cost;\n        bestAction = action;\n\
      \    }\n}\nai->ExecuteAction(bestAction);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's planning phase to evaluate
    possible actions. The returned cost value may be influenced by factors such as
    bot level, equipped items, current mana/energy levels, and other contextual variables.
    It's important to note that this method does not perform the action itself, but
    only calculates its cost.
  warnings: The cost calculation might vary depending on the AI context and bot state.
    Relying solely on cost comparisons without considering other factors like success
    probability or strategic value could lead to suboptimal AI behavior. Also, ensure
    that the BotAI pointer passed is valid and not null when calling this method.
