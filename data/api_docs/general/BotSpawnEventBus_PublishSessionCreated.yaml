  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: PublishSessionCreated
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::PublishSessionCreated(std::shared_ptr<BotSession>
    session, const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes a bot session creation event to notify subscribers of a new bot
    session.
  description: The PublishSessionCreated method is responsible for broadcasting a
    notification that a new bot session has been successfully created. This method
    is typically invoked within the TrinityCore framework when a bot is initialized
    or spawned, allowing other systems or modules to react to the event. It ensures
    that interested components can perform necessary setup, logging, or state updates
    upon session creation. The method takes a shared pointer to a BotSession object
    and an integer request identifier as parameters, which may be used for tracking
    or correlating the session with specific requests or operations.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A shared pointer to the newly created BotSession object. This parameter
      represents the bot session that has been initialized and is ready for use.
  - name: request
    description: An integer reference representing a request identifier associated
      with the session creation. This value may be used to correlate the session with
      an originating request or operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PublishSessionCreated
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = std::make_shared<BotSession>(botId);

      int requestId = 12345;

      bus.PublishSessionCreated(session, requestId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an event bus system and likely uses a publish-subscribe
    pattern. It's important to ensure that subscribers are properly registered before
    calling this method to avoid missed notifications. The shared pointer to the session
    ensures proper memory management, but care should be taken to avoid circular references
    if the session holds references back to the event bus.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotSession object passed in is fully initialized and valid
    before publishing the event. Passing a null or uninitialized session may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes in subscribers.
