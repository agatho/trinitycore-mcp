  class: DefensiveManager
  method: DefensiveManager
  signature: void DefensiveManager::DefensiveManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DefensiveManager instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The DefensiveManager constructor initializes the defensive behavior
    system for a player bot. This method sets up internal state and configurations
    necessary for the bot to perform defensive actions such as targeting enemies,
    managing threat, and executing defensive spells or abilities. It is typically
    called during the creation or initialization phase of a bot's AI system to ensure
    proper setup before the bot begins engaging in combat or defensive activities.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this DefensiveManager
      will manage. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of DefensiveManager
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid player bot

      DefensiveManager defManager(myBot);

      // The defensive manager is now initialized for the bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely initializes internal data structures such as threat
    tables, target selection logic, and defensive spell cooldown tracking. It may
    also register event handlers or callbacks needed for real-time defensive behavior
    updates.
