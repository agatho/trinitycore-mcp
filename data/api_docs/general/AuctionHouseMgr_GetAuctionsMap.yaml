  class: AuctionHouseMgr
  method: GetAuctionsMap
  signature: AuctionHouseObject * AuctionHouseMgr::GetAuctionsMap(uint32 factionTemplateId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction house object map for the specified faction template
    ID.
  description: The GetAuctionsMap method retrieves a pointer to the AuctionHouseObject
    associated with the given faction template ID. This method is used internally
    by the auction house system to manage and access auction data specific to different
    factions in World of Warcraft. The returned pointer allows access to all auctions
    listed under that faction's auction house, including item listings, bid information,
    and auction durations. This method typically serves as a lookup mechanism within
    the auction house manager's internal data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: factionTemplateId
    description: The faction template identifier used to determine which auction house
      map to retrieve. Valid values correspond to faction template IDs defined in
      the game's database, typically ranging from 1 to several thousand depending
      on the expansion and content.
  returns: A pointer to an AuctionHouseObject that contains all auctions for the specified
    faction template ID. Returns nullptr if no auction house data exists for the given
    faction template ID or if the faction is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AuctionHouseObject* auctionMap = sAuctionHouseMgr->GetAuctionsMap(1234);\n\
      if (auctionMap != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process auctions in the map\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Faction Auctions
    code: "uint32 playerFactionId = player->getFaction();\nAuctionHouseObject* factionAuctions\
      \ = sAuctionHouseMgr->GetAuctionsMap(playerFactionId);\nif (factionAuctions)\n\
      {\n    // Iterate through auctions for this faction\n    for (auto& auction\
      \ : factionAuctions->GetAuctions())\n    {\n        // Process each auction\
      \ entry\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures of the AuctionHouseMgr and
    should only be called from within the auction house system or related subsystems.
    The returned pointer is valid only during the lifetime of the AuctionHouseObject
    associated with that faction template ID. Be cautious when modifying auction data
    through this map as it may affect other systems relying on auction house consistency.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned pointer will remain valid across different
    game states or thread contexts. Calling this method with an invalid faction template
    ID may result in a nullptr return, which should be handled gracefully to prevent
    crashes. Avoid modifying auction data directly through this map without proper
    locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
