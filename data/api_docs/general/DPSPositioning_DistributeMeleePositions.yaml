  class: DPSPositioning
  method: DistributeMeleePositions
  signature: void DPSPositioning::DistributeMeleePositions(const int & meleeDPS, Unit
    * target, Player * tank)
documentation:
  brief: Positions melee DPS units around a target based on tank proximity and combat
    requirements.
  description: The DistributeMeleePositions method is responsible for calculating
    and assigning optimal positioning for melee DPS players in a group or raid setting.
    It takes into account the target unit's location, the tank's position, and the
    melee DPS count to determine where each DPS member should stand to maximize damage
    output while maintaining proper threat distribution and avoiding unnecessary movement
    during combat. This method is typically used in encounter AI logic to dynamically
    adjust player positioning during boss fights or other scripted encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: meleeDPS
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of melee DPS players
      that need to be positioned around the target.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that represents the combat target for
      which positioning is being calculated. This is typically a boss or enemy NPC.
  - name: tank
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the current tank in the
      group. Positioning logic uses this unit's location as a reference point for
      optimal DPS placement.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter AI
    code: "void MyBossAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n  \
      \  Player* tank = GetTank();\n    int meleeCount = GetMeleeDPSCount();\n   \
      \ DistributeMeleePositions(meleeCount, target, tank);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Positioning with Dynamic Target
    code: "void RaidEncounter::HandlePhaseTransition()\n{\n    Unit* currentTarget\
      \ = GetTarget();\n    Player* mainTank = GetMainTank();\n    int dpsCount =\
      \ GetActiveMeleeDPS();\n    \n    if (currentTarget && mainTank)\n    {\n  \
      \      DistributeMeleePositions(dpsCount, currentTarget, mainTank);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex spatial calculations to determine optimal
    positioning angles and distances. It may utilize pathfinding or collision detection
    to ensure units don't end up in invalid positions. The implementation might also
    consider the target's threat radius and the tank's aggro mechanics when determining
    final placements.
  warnings: Care must be taken when calling this method during active combat as it
    could potentially disrupt existing player positioning or movement patterns. Ensure
    that the target unit and tank are valid pointers before invoking this function
    to avoid undefined behavior.
