documentation:
  brief: Clears all stored positions from the position strategy base.
  description: The ClearAllPositions method removes all currently stored position
    data from the PositionStrategyBase instance. This method is typically used to
    reset or initialize the position tracking state, ensuring that no previous position
    data interferes with subsequent calculations or strategies. The operation is destructive
    and will invalidate any existing position references held by the strategy. This
    method is commonly invoked during initialization phases or when switching between
    different positioning behaviors in AI or movement systems.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase strategy;

      strategy.ClearAllPositions();

      // All positions are now cleared from the strategy'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an immediate cleanup of all internal position data structures.
    It is recommended to call this before populating new positions to avoid any potential
    conflicts or unexpected behavior in positioning calculations.
