api:
  class: CraftingOrderItem
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void CraftingOrderItem::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player *
    owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes crafting order item data into a byte buffer for network transmission
    to specified players.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state of a CraftingOrderItem
    object into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for network transmission. This method is
    typically used when sending crafting order item information from the server to
    clients, ensuring that relevant data such as item properties, quantities, and
    status are correctly formatted. The serialization includes data specific to both
    the owner and receiver players, making it suitable for crafting order notifications
    or updates in World of Warcraft's trading system. It is designed to be called
    during network packet construction for crafting-related communications.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized crafting order item
      data will be written.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the crafting
      order item. Can be null if not applicable.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the receiver of the crafting
      order item. Can be null if not applicable.
  returns: No return value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in crafting order packet creation
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = session->GetPlayer();

      Player* receiver = GetReceiverPlayer();

      CraftingOrderItem item;

      item.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send data through network

      SendPacket(data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the crafting system's networking protocol and should
    only be called when preparing data for transmission to players. It assumes that
    the ByteBuffer is properly initialized and that player pointers are valid during
    execution.
  warnings: Ensure that both owner and receiver player objects remain valid throughout
    the duration of this call, as dangling pointers may cause undefined behavior.
    This method does not perform any validation on input parameters beyond basic null
    checks.
