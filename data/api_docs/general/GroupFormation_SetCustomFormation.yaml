  method: SetCustomFormation
  signature: void GroupFormation::SetCustomFormation(const int & positions)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the custom formation for a group, defining how members should position
    themselves.
  description: The SetCustomFormation method configures a group's formation behavior
    to use a custom positioning scheme. This allows groups to define specific spatial
    arrangements for their members during movement or combat scenarios. The method
    takes an integer parameter that represents the formation type or configuration
    index. This functionality is typically used in advanced group management systems
    where precise control over group positioning is required, such as in raid encounters
    or scripted events.
  parameters:
  - name: positions
    description: An integer value representing the custom formation configuration
      to apply. Valid values depend on the internal formation system implementation
      and may correspond to predefined formation types or custom layout indices.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Custom Formation
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->SetCustomFormation(5); // Apply custom formation with index 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the group's internal formation manager
    and may require the group to be in a valid state for changes to take effect. The
    actual behavior of different formation indices is determined by the game's formation
    system implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided positions parameter corresponds to a valid formation
    type within the game's formation system. Invalid indices may result in undefined
    behavior or default formation usage.
