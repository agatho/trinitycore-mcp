  class: WorldObjectSpellNearbyTargetCheck
  method: WorldObjectSpellNearbyTargetCheck
  signature: void WorldObjectSpellNearbyTargetCheck::WorldObjectSpellNearbyTargetCheck(float
    range, WorldObject * caster, const SpellInfo * spellInfo, SpellTargetCheckTypes
    selectionType, const int * condList, SpellTargetObjectTypes objectType)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spell target check for nearby objects within a specified range.
  description: The WorldObjectSpellNearbyTargetCheck constructor sets up a target
    selection mechanism for spells that need to identify nearby valid targets. It
    configures parameters such as the maximum range, caster object, spell information,
    target selection type, conditional list, and expected object types. This check
    is typically used during spell execution to determine which nearby objects qualify
    as valid targets based on game rules and conditions. The method prepares internal
    state for subsequent target validation calls.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: Maximum distance in yards within which targets will be considered.
      Must be a positive value.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is casting the spell. Cannot be null.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing spell data and properties.
      Cannot be null.
  - name: selectionType
    description: Enumeration value specifying how targets should be selected (e.g.,
      nearest, furthest, random).
  - name: condList
    description: Pointer to an array of conditional IDs that define additional criteria
      for target selection. Can be null if no conditions apply.
  - name: objectType
    description: Enumeration value indicating the expected type of target objects
      (e.g., unit, game object, item).
  returns: None. This is a constructor method that initializes internal state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for targeting nearby enemies
    code: 'WorldObjectSpellNearbyTargetCheck check(30.0f, caster, spellInfo, TARGET_CHECK_ENEMY,
      nullptr, TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_UNIT);

      // Used in spell target selection logic to find valid targets within 30 yards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional targeting
    code: 'int conditions[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      WorldObjectSpellNearbyTargetCheck check(50.0f, caster, spellInfo, TARGET_CHECK_FRIENDLY,
      conditions, TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_UNIT);

      // Selects friendly units within 50 yards that meet specific conditional requirements'
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is part of the TrinityCore's spell target selection system and
    works in conjunction with other target check classes. The range parameter is interpreted
    as a straight-line distance, not pathfinding distance. The condList parameter
    can be used to implement complex targeting rules such as only selecting targets
    that meet certain criteria (e.g., health percentage, faction, etc.).
  warnings: Ensure the caster and spellInfo parameters are valid pointers before calling
    this constructor. Passing null for either of these will likely cause crashes or
    undefined behavior. The condList array must remain valid throughout the lifetime
    of the check object.
