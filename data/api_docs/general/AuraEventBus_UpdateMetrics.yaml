  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void AuraEventBus::UpdateMetrics(std::chrono::microseconds processingTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics with the provided processing time for aura events.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recording and updating
    performance-related statistics within the AuraEventBus class. It accepts a std::chrono::microseconds
    parameter representing the time taken to process a specific aura event, allowing
    the system to track and analyze the efficiency of aura handling operations. This
    method is typically called internally by the core game loop or event processing
    mechanisms when an aura event has been completed. The recorded metrics can be
    used for performance monitoring, debugging, and optimization purposes within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: processingTime
    description: The time duration in microseconds that was spent processing a single
      aura event. This value represents the actual CPU time consumed during the execution
      of the aura event handling logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AuraEventBus bus;

      std::chrono::microseconds time(150);

      bus.UpdateMetrics(time);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Performance Monitoring
    code: "void HandleAuraEvent(Aura* aura) {\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // Process aura logic here\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end\
      \ - start);\n    AuraEventBus::Instance()->UpdateMetrics(duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from within the core game loop or event handlers.
    It's important to note that the processing time should be measured accurately
    using high-resolution timing functions to ensure meaningful metric data. The implementation
    may use atomic operations or locking mechanisms to safely update shared metrics
    across multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the processingTime parameter is always a positive value, as
    negative values could skew performance statistics. When calling this method in
    performance-critical sections, be mindful of potential overhead from metric recording
    operations.
