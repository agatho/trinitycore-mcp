  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: DecideLootRoll
  signature: LootDecision GroupCoordinator::DecideLootRoll(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the loot roll decision for a specified item within the group coordinator's
    context.
  description: The DecideLootRoll method evaluates the current group's loot distribution
    rules and player eligibility to determine whether to accept or pass on a specific
    item. This method is typically invoked during a loot roll event when a group member
    has rolled for an item, and it considers factors such as loot rules (need/greed/pass),
    player roles, and group composition. The decision-making process ensures fair
    and consistent loot distribution according to the group's configured loot settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LootDecision enum value indicating whether the group coordinator decides
    to accept ('ACCEPT') or pass ('PASS') the loot roll for the specified item. The
    method may also return 'NEED' if the item is determined to be needed by a group
    member based on current inventory and role requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot Roll Decision
    code: "LootDecision decision = groupCoordinator.DecideLootRoll(12345);\nif (decision\
      \ == LOOT_DECISION_ACCEPT)\n{\n    // Process item acceptance\n    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal group state and loot rules configuration.
    It should only be called during active loot roll events to ensure accurate decision-making
    based on current group context.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a proper loot roll context may result in
    incorrect decisions or undefined behavior due to missing player eligibility data
    or group state information.
