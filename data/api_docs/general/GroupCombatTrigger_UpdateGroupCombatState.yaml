  method: UpdateGroupCombatState
  signature: void GroupCombatTrigger::UpdateGroupCombatState(Group * group, bool inCombat)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat state of all group members when a group member enters
    or exits combat.
  description: The UpdateGroupCombatState method is responsible for synchronizing
    the combat status across all members of a group when one member's combat state
    changes. This ensures that all group members are aware of each other's combat
    status, which is essential for proper group mechanics such as loot sharing, combat
    visibility, and certain spell interactions. The method takes a pointer to a Group
    object and a boolean indicating whether the group should be marked as being in
    combat. It updates internal tracking structures and potentially notifies clients
    about the change in combat state.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose members' combat states will be
      updated. Must not be null.
  - name: inCombat
    description: Boolean flag indicating the new combat state for the group. True
      means the group is now in combat, false means they are no longer in combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Group Combat State to In Combat
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    GroupCombatTrigger::UpdateGroupCombatState(myGroup,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update Group Combat State to Out of Combat
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    GroupCombatTrigger::UpdateGroupCombatState(myGroup,\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core when a group member's
    combat state changes. It may trigger updates to player client states and internal
    group tracking data structures. The method assumes that the provided Group pointer
    is valid and that the group has members.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid before calling,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This method modifies
    internal state of the group and its members, so it should only be called when
    appropriate combat state transitions occur.
