  method: ModCharges
  signature: bool AuraScript::ModCharges(int num, int removeMode)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the charge count of an aura, with optional removal behavior.
  description: The ModCharges method adjusts the current charge count of an aura by
    adding or subtracting a specified number of charges. It allows for fine-grained
    control over how many times an aura can be consumed before it expires. The removeMode
    parameter determines whether charges are removed immediately or at the next aura
    tick. This method is commonly used in custom aura scripts to implement mechanics
    such as limited-use abilities, consumable effects, or cooldown-based resource
    management.
  parameters:
  - name: num
    description: The number of charges to add or remove. Positive values increase
      charges, negative values decrease them.
  - name: removeMode
    description: Controls when charges are removed. 0 = immediate removal, 1 = delayed
      removal at next tick. Default is typically 0.
  returns: Returns true if the charge modification was successful and the aura still
    exists; false if the aura was removed due to depletion of charges or other conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Add Charges to an Aura
    code: "void AddChargeExample()\n{\n    // Add 2 charges to current aura\n    if\
      \ (ModCharges(2, 0))\n    {\n        // Successfully added charges\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Charges with Delayed Removal
    code: "void RemoveChargeDelayed()\n{\n    // Remove 1 charge with delayed removal\n\
      \    if (ModCharges(-1, 1))\n    {\n        // Charge removed, effect will be\
      \ applied at next tick\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the aura's internal charge counter and may trigger
    aura removal if charges reach zero. It is typically called from within AuraScript::OnApply
    or AuraScript::OnUpdate callbacks. The removeMode parameter affects when the actual
    charge reduction occurs, which can be important for timing-sensitive effects.
  warnings: Be cautious when using negative values with removeMode = 1 as it may cause
    unexpected behavior if not properly synchronized with aura update cycles. Avoid
    calling this method from within aura application logic that might conflict with
    charge-based removal conditions.
