  method: InitializeHerbalismZones
  signature: void FarmingCoordinator::InitializeHerbalismZones()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes herbalism zone data for the farming coordinator.
  description: The InitializeHerbalismZones method sets up and loads all necessary
    herbalism-related zone information for the FarmingCoordinator. This includes registering
    zones where herbalism nodes can be found, configuring node spawn rates, and establishing
    zone-specific herbalism mechanics. The method typically runs during server startup
    or when the farming coordinator is initialized to ensure that all herbalism data
    is properly loaded and available for player interactions. It prepares internal
    data structures required for tracking herbalism resources across different zones
    in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.InitializeHerbalismZones();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the coordinator's initialization
    phase. It is not thread-safe and should be executed on the main server thread
    to avoid race conditions with zone data loading.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate zone registrations
    or memory leaks. Ensure that all zone data is properly cleaned up before reinitialization.
