  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: AddDangerZone
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::AddDangerZone(const int & center, float radius,
    float duration, float dangerLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a danger zone to the position strategy with specified center, radius,
    duration, and danger level.
  description: The AddDangerZone method registers a circular area of danger within
    the position strategy system. This method is typically used by AI scripts or game
    mechanics to define areas where units should avoid or react to. The danger zone
    is defined by a center point (represented as an integer), radius, duration (how
    long the danger persists), and a danger level that influences AI behavior. The
    method does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the PositionStrategyBase
    object to include the new danger zone.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the danger zone, represented as an integer identifier
      (likely a coordinate or node index).
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the danger zone in world units. Defines how far the
      danger extends from the center.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration for which the danger zone remains active, measured in
      seconds.
  - name: dangerLevel
    description: A floating-point value representing the intensity or threat level
      of the danger zone, influencing AI avoidance behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase strategy;

      strategy.AddDangerZone(100, 5.0f, 30.0f, 2.5f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Values
    code: 'int zoneCenter = GetPlayerPosition().x;

      float zoneRadius = 10.0f;

      float zoneDuration = GetTimeRemaining();

      float dangerLevel = CalculateThreatLevel();

      strategy.AddDangerZone(zoneCenter, zoneRadius, zoneDuration, dangerLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the PositionStrategyBase object.
    It is recommended to call this method before any pathfinding or positioning calculations
    to ensure accurate AI behavior. The center parameter may represent a coordinate
    system or node index depending on how the strategy is implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that the duration and dangerLevel values are within expected ranges
    to prevent unexpected AI behavior. If the center value does not correspond to
    a valid location, the danger zone may be ignored or cause undefined behavior.
