  class: CommandScript
  method: CommandScript
  signature: void CommandScript::CommandScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CommandScript instance with the specified command name.
  description: The CommandScript constructor initializes a new command script instance
    with the provided command name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore
    framework to register and manage in-game commands. The command name is stored
    internally for later use in command handling and execution. This constructor is
    part of the command system that allows administrators and developers to extend
    the game's functionality through custom commands. It does not perform any command
    execution itself but sets up the necessary infrastructure for command registration.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The name of the command to be registered. This string is used to
      identify the command in the command system and must be unique within the context
      of available commands.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CommandScript Initialization
    code: "class MyCustomCommand : public CommandScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyCustomCommand()\
      \ : CommandScript(\"mycommand\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called by derived command classes to register
    their command names. The command name should be unique and follow the naming conventions
    used by TrinityCore's command system. The constructor does not validate the command
    name format, so it's up to the developer to ensure proper naming.
