  class: LOSCache
  method: GetPairHash
  signature: uint64_t LOSCache::GetPairHash(const int & pos1, const int & pos2) const
documentation:
  brief: Computes and returns a unique hash value for a pair of integer positions
    used in line-of-sight caching.
  description: The GetPairHash method generates a deterministic 64-bit hash value
    based on two integer parameters, pos1 and pos2. This hash is typically used as
    a key in caching systems to uniquely identify pairs of positions, such as in line-of-sight
    (LOS) calculations within the TrinityCore framework. The method ensures consistent
    hashing for identical input pairs while providing good distribution for different
    inputs. It's commonly employed in spatial indexing or caching mechanisms where
    position-based lookups are required. The implementation likely uses a combination
    of bitwise operations and multiplication to produce the hash, ensuring minimal
    collisions for typical game world coordinates.
  parameters:
  - name: pos1
    description: First integer position value, typically representing an X or Y coordinate
      in world space
  - name: pos2
    description: Second integer position value, typically representing a Z coordinate
      or secondary dimension in world space
  returns: A unique 64-bit unsigned integer hash value that represents the combined
    input pair of positions. This hash can be used as a key in hash tables or caches
    to efficiently store and retrieve LOS-related data for specific position pairs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LOSCache cache;

      int x = 100, y = 200;

      uint64_t hash = cache.GetPairHash(x, y);

      // hash now contains the unique hash for position pair (100, 200)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Hash for Caching
    code: "LOSCache cache;\nuint64_t key = cache.GetPairHash(playerPos.x, playerPos.y);\n\
      if (cache.Contains(key)) {\n    // Retrieve cached LOS result\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Perform LOS calculation and store in cache\n    cache.Insert(key, losResult);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be fast and deterministic. The hash function should
    produce consistent results across different calls with the same inputs. It's optimized
    for use in high-frequency operations like LOS checks in game environments where
    performance is critical. The method assumes that pos1 and pos2 are valid integer
    coordinates, typically within the expected range of world positions.
  warnings: Ensure that the input parameters represent valid coordinate values to
    avoid unexpected behavior. While this method itself doesn't validate inputs, invalid
    or extreme coordinate values may lead to poor hash distribution or collisions
    in cache implementations. Be aware that hash collisions, though unlikely, can
    occur and should be handled appropriately in consuming code.
