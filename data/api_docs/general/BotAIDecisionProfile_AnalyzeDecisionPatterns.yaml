  signature: void BotAIDecisionProfile::AnalyzeDecisionPatterns()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and processes decision-making patterns for bot AI behavior in World
    of Warcraft TrinityCore environment.
  description: The AnalyzeDecisionPatterns method evaluates historical decision data
    collected by the BotAIDecisionProfile class to identify recurring behavioral trends
    and optimize future AI choices. This method is typically invoked during bot initialization
    or periodic updates to refine decision-making algorithms based on past performance
    metrics. It processes internal data structures containing player interaction logs,
    combat decisions, and environmental responses to enhance the bot's strategic capabilities
    within the game world.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Initialization
    code: 'BotAIDecisionProfile profile;

      profile.AnalyzeDecisionPatterns();

      // Method processes internal decision data to improve AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after sufficient decision history has been collected
    to ensure meaningful pattern analysis. The implementation may involve computationally
    intensive operations that could impact performance during high-frequency bot updates.
  warnings: Calling this method before collecting adequate decision data may result
    in suboptimal AI behavior patterns. The method modifies internal state and should
    not be invoked concurrently with other AI processing methods.
