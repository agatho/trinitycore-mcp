  class: VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker
  method: GetTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker::GetTimeRemaining() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for the vengeance demon spikes
    effect.
  description: The GetTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration left on the VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker's
    active effect. This tracker is typically associated with the Demon Hunter's Vengeance
    ability, which applies a damage absorption shield that ticks over time. The returned
    value represents how many milliseconds remain before the effect expires. This
    method is commonly used for UI updates, cooldown tracking, and determining when
    to refresh or remove visual effects related to the demon spikes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time remaining in milliseconds. Returns
    0 if the effect has expired or is not active.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Vengeance Demon Spikes are still active
    code: "if (vengeanceTracker->GetTimeRemaining() > 0)\n{\n    // Demon spikes are\
      \ still active\n    // Update UI to show remaining time\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Effect has expired\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate percentage of effect duration remaining
    code: 'uint32 totalTime = 10000; // Example total duration in ms

      uint32 remainingTime = vengeanceTracker->GetTimeRemaining();

      float percentRemaining = (static_cast<float>(remainingTime) / static_cast<float>(totalTime))
      * 100.0f;

      // Use percentRemaining for progress bar or tooltip display'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the game loop or event handlers that
    manage active effects. The returned value may be zero if the effect has already
    expired or was never initialized, so callers should handle this case appropriately.
    The time remaining is usually updated by internal game mechanics and does not
    require manual updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker object is valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. This method assumes the tracker is properly
    initialized with a valid effect state; calling it on an uninitialized or destroyed
    tracker may result in incorrect values or crashes.
