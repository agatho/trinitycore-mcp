  signature: int32 NullGameObjectAI::Permissible(const GameObject * go)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the permissiveness level for a GameObject AI to handle a specific
    game object.
  description: The Permissible method is used in TrinityCore's AI system to evaluate
    whether a particular AI class (in this case, NullGameObjectAI) is suitable or
    appropriate for handling a given GameObject. This method returns an integer value
    that indicates how permissible it is for the AI to be used with the specified
    game object. A higher return value suggests a stronger match or preference for
    using this AI type. The NullGameObjectAI typically returns a low permissible value,
    indicating it's not meant to be used for actual AI behavior but rather as a fallback
    or placeholder implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the permissiveness level. Typically,
    values like 0 indicate that the AI is not suitable for the object, while negative
    values may indicate disapproval or inappropriateness. Positive values might suggest
    suitability or preference, though exact semantics depend on the broader AI framework
    implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Selection
    code: "int32 permissible = ai->Permissible(gameobject);\nif (permissible > 0)\
      \ {\n    // This AI is suitable for handling the game object\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's GameObject AI system and is used
    during AI assignment or selection processes. It allows for dynamic determination
    of which AI should be assigned to a GameObject based on its type, properties,
    or other criteria. The NullGameObjectAI implementation usually returns a low value
    to indicate it should not be actively used.
