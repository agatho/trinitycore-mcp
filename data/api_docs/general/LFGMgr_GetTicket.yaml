  method: GetTicket
  signature: const WorldPackets::LFG::RideTicket * LFGMgr::GetTicket(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the LFG ride ticket associated with a given GUID.
  description: The GetTicket method retrieves a pointer to the LFG (Looking For Group)
    ride ticket for a specific player identified by their GUID. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to manage and access player group matching
    data, particularly in scenarios involving dungeon or raid queues. The returned
    ticket contains information about the player's current LFG status, including their
    role, preferred difficulty, and other relevant queue details. It is important
    to note that this method does not create or modify tickets; it only retrieves
    existing ones from internal storage.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG ticket is being
      retrieved. This should be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: A constant pointer to a WorldPackets::LFG::RideTicket object representing
    the player's current LFG ticket, or nullptr if no ticket exists for the specified
    GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check LFG Ticket
    code: "const WorldPackets::LFG::RideTicket* ticket = lfgMgr->GetTicket(playerGuid);\n\
      if (ticket != nullptr) {\n    // Process the ticket data\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player %u has LFG ticket with dungeon ID: %u\", playerGuid, ticket->DungeonID);\n\
      } else {\n    sLog->outString(\"No LFG ticket found for player %u\", playerGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal LFG data structures and should be used carefully
    in performance-sensitive contexts. The returned pointer is valid only as long
    as the ticket exists in memory and should not be stored or dereferenced beyond
    its lifetime.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method is valid and corresponds to
    an actual player in the game world, otherwise a nullptr will be returned. Avoid
    storing the returned pointer for extended periods as it may become invalid if
    the ticket is removed or modified.
