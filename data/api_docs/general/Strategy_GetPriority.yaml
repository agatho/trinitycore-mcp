  method: GetPriority
  signature: uint32 Strategy::GetPriority() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the priority value of the strategy for execution ordering in the
    AI system.
  description: The GetPriority method returns a uint32 value that determines the order
    in which strategies are evaluated and executed within the TrinityCore AI framework.
    Lower priority values are processed before higher values, allowing for strategic
    prioritization of different AI behaviors. This method is typically used by the
    AI system to sort and manage strategy execution based on defined precedence rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the strategy's priority level. Lower values
    indicate higher priority and earlier execution in the AI decision-making process.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Strategy Priority
    code: "Strategy* myStrategy = new ExampleStrategy();\nuint32 priority = myStrategy->GetPriority();\n\
      if (priority < 100)\n{\n    // This strategy has high priority\n    // Execute\
      \ special handling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The priority value is usually set during strategy initialization and should
    remain constant during the object's lifetime. Strategies with identical priority
    values may be executed in an undefined order. This method is thread-safe as it
    only reads immutable data.
