  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: ResetStats
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::ResetStats()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all bot statistics and counters to their initial default values.
  description: The ResetStats method clears and reinitializes all internal statistics
    and performance counters within the EnhancedBotAI instance. This includes resetting
    kill counts, combat metrics, quest progress tracking, and any other accumulated
    data that the AI maintains for behavioral tuning and performance analysis. The
    method ensures a clean slate for the bot's operation, typically called when transitioning
    between different gameplay scenarios or when restarting a bot's session. It does
    not affect the bot's current state, behavior patterns, or configuration settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EnhancedBotAI* botAI = ...;

      botAI->ResetStats();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Bot Lifecycle Management
    code: "void OnBotReset(Bot* bot)\n{\n    if (auto* ai = dynamic_cast<EnhancedBotAI*>(bot->GetAI()))\n\
      \    {\n        ai->ResetStats();\n        // Reinitialize bot behavior after\
      \ reset\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during bot initialization, scenario transitions,
    or when a clean state is required for accurate performance metrics. It should
    be used carefully in performance-critical sections as it may involve resetting
    internal data structures that could impact real-time processing.
  warnings: Calling ResetStats while the bot is actively engaged in combat or complex
    operations might lead to inconsistent behavior or loss of temporary state data.
    Ensure the bot is idle or in a safe state before invoking this method.
