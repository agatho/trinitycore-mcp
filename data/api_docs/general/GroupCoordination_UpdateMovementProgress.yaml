documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement progress of a group coordination object.
  description: The UpdateMovementProgress method is responsible for advancing or recalculating
    the current movement state within a group coordination context. This typically
    involves updating positions, orientations, or other movement-related attributes
    of group members to ensure synchronization across the group. The method may be
    invoked during gameplay events such as pathfinding updates, teleportations, or
    dynamic group repositioning. It is commonly used in conjunction with movement
    handling systems to maintain accurate group positioning and prevent desynchronization
    between players.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coordination = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordination();

      coordination->UpdateMovementProgress();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often called internally by the core movement system and may
    not need to be invoked manually in most cases. It's important to ensure that the
    group coordination object is valid before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or uninitialized GroupCoordination object
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the group exists
    and has active members before invoking this function.
