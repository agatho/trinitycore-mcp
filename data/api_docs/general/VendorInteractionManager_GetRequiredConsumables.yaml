documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of required consumable items for a vendor interaction.
  description: The GetRequiredConsumables method returns an integer value representing
    the number of consumable items that are required to complete a vendor transaction.
    This typically corresponds to the quantity of items such as arrows, bullets, or
    other expendable resources that must be present in the player's inventory before
    they can purchase or interact with certain vendor services. The method is part
    of the VendorInteractionManager class and provides essential information for validating
    player inventory state during vendor interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the total number of required consumable items.
    Returns zero if no consumables are required, or a positive integer if consumables
    are needed for the interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int requiredConsumables = vendorInteractionManager.GetRequiredConsumables();\n\
      if (requiredConsumables > 0)\n{\n    // Player needs to have at least 'requiredConsumables'\
      \ items in inventory\n    // before proceeding with the vendor interaction\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during vendor interaction validation to ensure
    that players meet all prerequisites before completing a transaction. It may be
    used in conjunction with other methods like GetRequiredItem() or CheckInventory()
    to fully validate whether a player can complete a vendor interaction.
