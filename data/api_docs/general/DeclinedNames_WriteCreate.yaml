  class: DeclinedNames
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void DeclinedNames::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes declined names data into a byte buffer for player creation.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes declined names information into a
    ByteBuffer format suitable for network transmission during player creation. This
    method is typically invoked when sending player data to clients, ensuring that
    any declined name variations (such as plural forms or cases) are properly encoded
    and transmitted. The serialization includes all relevant declined name fields
    associated with the specified owner player and may consider the receiver's perspective
    for proper localization or access control. This functionality is integral to maintaining
    character naming consistency and supporting internationalization features in World
    of Warcraft's client-server communication.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the declined names data will be written.
      This buffer is typically used for constructing network packets sent to clients.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose declined names are being serialized.
      This represents the character whose name variations are being transmitted.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this data. Used to
      determine appropriate serialization based on receiver's permissions or localization
      context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player creation flow
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // some existing player

      Player* receiver = ...; // target player

      DeclinedNames declinedNames;

      declinedNames.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal serialization system for player data.
    It assumes that the DeclinedNames object has valid data loaded and that both owner
    and receiver pointers are valid. The method does not perform any validation on
    input parameters beyond basic null checks.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or null player pointers as it may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the ByteBuffer is properly
    initialized before calling this method.
