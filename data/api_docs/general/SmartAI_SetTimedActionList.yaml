  class: SmartAI
  method: SetTimedActionList
  signature: void SmartAI::SetTimedActionList(SmartScriptHolder & e, uint32 entry,
    Unit * invoker, uint32 startFromEventId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and assigns a timed action list to the SmartAI instance for execution.
  description: The SetTimedActionList method configures the SmartAI instance to execute
    a specific timed action list defined by the provided SmartScriptHolder. This method
    is typically used in conjunction with event-driven AI behavior where actions are
    scheduled to occur at specific time intervals or after certain conditions are
    met. The invoker parameter allows for context awareness, enabling the script to
    respond appropriately based on who triggered the action. The startFromEventId
    parameter determines from which event ID the execution should begin, allowing
    for precise control over script flow and timing.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder object containing the timed action
      list definition and associated script data.
  - name: entry
    description: Unique identifier for the script entry point, used to distinguish
      between different AI behaviors or instances within the same creature or game
      object.
  - name: invoker
    description: Pointer to the Unit that triggered this action list execution. Can
      be NULL if no specific invoker is available.
  - name: startFromEventId
    description: The event ID from which to begin executing actions in the timed action
      list. This allows for selective starting points within a larger script sequence.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with creature AI
    code: 'SmartScriptHolder holder;

      // ... populate holder with script data ...

      Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->GetAI()->SetTimedActionList(holder, 12345, nullptr, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with specific invoker and event ID
    code: 'SmartScriptHolder holder;

      // ... populate holder with script data ...

      Unit* player = ...;

      Creature* npc = ...;

      npc->GetAI()->SetTimedActionList(holder, 67890, player, 5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly execute the actions; it sets up the internal
    state for timed execution. The actual execution occurs when the SmartAI's UpdateAI
    method is called and processes the scheduled events. Ensure that the SmartScriptHolder
    passed contains valid script data to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized SmartScriptHolder can lead to crashes
    or unexpected AI behavior. Always validate the entry parameter to ensure it corresponds
    to a valid script entry in the database.
