  method: UpdatePolicy
  signature: void PolicyNetwork::UpdatePolicy(const int & trajectory, float learningRate)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the policy network using the specified trajectory and learning rate
    for reinforcement learning.
  description: The UpdatePolicy method performs a policy gradient update on the neural
    network used for decision making in AI behavior. It takes a trajectory (sequence
    of states, actions, and rewards) and applies a learning rate to adjust the network's
    weights. This method is typically used in reinforcement learning scenarios where
    the AI needs to improve its decision-making based on past experiences. The update
    process involves computing gradients from the trajectory and applying them to
    the policy network parameters. The method modifies the internal state of the PolicyNetwork
    object, making it a mutating operation.
  parameters:
  - name: trajectory
    description: An integer identifier representing the sequence of states, actions,
      and rewards used for training. This typically corresponds to a specific episode
      or experience batch in reinforcement learning.
  - name: learningRate
    description: A floating-point value that controls the step size of the parameter
      updates during gradient descent. Higher values lead to faster learning but may
      cause instability, while lower values result in slower convergence but more
      stable training.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Policy Update
    code: 'PolicyNetwork policyNet;

      int episodeId = 42;

      float lr = 0.01f;

      policyNet.UpdatePolicy(episodeId, lr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Policy Update with Dynamic Learning Rate
    code: 'PolicyNetwork policyNet;

      int trajectoryId = 1001;

      float dynamicLR = 0.001f * (1.0f - episodeCount / 1000.0f); // Decaying learning
      rate

      policyNet.UpdatePolicy(trajectoryId, dynamicLR);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the trajectory data has already been processed and
    stored in the PolicyNetwork's internal buffers. The implementation likely uses
    backpropagation through time or similar techniques for policy gradient updates.
    Performance may be impacted by large trajectories or high learning rates, as these
    can cause significant computation during gradient calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the policy network
    or with invalid trajectory identifiers may lead to undefined behavior. The learning
    rate should be carefully tuned to avoid divergence or slow convergence. Using
    very high learning rates can cause the policy to become unstable and lose learned
    behaviors.
