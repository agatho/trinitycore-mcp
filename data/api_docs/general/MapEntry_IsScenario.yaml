  class: MapEntry
  method: IsScenario
  signature: bool MapEntry::IsScenario() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map entry represents a scenario-based instance.
  description: The IsScenario method checks if the current MapEntry object corresponds
    to a scenario-type map, which is typically used for dynamic content such as world
    events, seasonal activities, or special questlines. This flag helps determine
    how the game should handle certain mechanics and interactions within that map
    environment. The method returns true if the map is designated as a scenario, false
    otherwise. Scenario maps often have unique behaviors like automatic reset timers,
    specific reward structures, or event-driven content that differs from regular
    dungeons or zones.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map entry represents a scenario-based instance; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Map is Scenario
    code: "if (mapEntry->IsScenario()) {\n    // Handle scenario-specific logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"This map is a scenario.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ regular map logic\n    sLog->outString(\"This map is not a scenario.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags set during map loading or configuration.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with other map-related checks to determine appropriate
    behavior for player interactions and quest handling within the game world.
