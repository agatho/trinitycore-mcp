  class: QuestCompletion
  method: MinimizeTravelTime
  signature: void QuestCompletion::MinimizeTravelTime(Player * bot, const int & objectives)
documentation:
  brief: Minimizes travel time for a bot player to complete quest objectives.
  description: The MinimizeTravelTime method optimizes the path and movement strategy
    for a bot player to efficiently complete quest objectives. This method adjusts
    the bot's travel behavior to reduce overall time spent traveling between quest
    locations, potentially prioritizing quest completion over other gameplay factors
    such as resource gathering or exploration. It is typically used in automated questing
    systems where efficiency is prioritized over traditional player behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will minimize
      travel time for quest completion.
  - name: objectives
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the number of quest objectives
      that need to be completed.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MinimizeTravelTime
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      int questObjectives = 3;

      QuestCompletion questComp;

      questComp.MinimizeTravelTime(bot, questObjectives);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies the bot's movement AI to prioritize direct paths
    to objectives. It may interact with pathfinding algorithms and could affect the
    bot's resource consumption or behavior in certain environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object passed is a valid bot instance, as using
    this method on a regular player may cause unexpected behavior or errors. The method
    assumes all quest objectives are accessible and properly initialized.
