documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for all subtlety rogue abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up the internal cooldown management
    system for a subtlety rogue class. This method is typically called during player
    initialization or when switching to the subtlety specialization. It ensures that
    all relevant abilities such as Evasion, Vanish, and Shadowstep have their cooldown
    states properly initialized. The method configures default cooldown timers and
    resets any existing cooldown data to prevent conflicts with previous sessions
    or character states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'SubtletyRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.InitializeCooldowns();

      // Cooldowns are now initialized for the rogue'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the character's lifecycle,
    typically during login or specialization change. It directly affects the player's
    ability to use stealth-based abilities and should not be invoked repeatedly without
    proper cooldown reset logic.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    incorrect cooldown states and unexpected behavior in combat. Ensure that any existing
    cooldown data is properly cleared before calling this method.
