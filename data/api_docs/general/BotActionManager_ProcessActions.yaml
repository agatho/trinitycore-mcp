  method: ProcessActions
  signature: uint32 BotActionManager::ProcessActions(uint32 maxActions)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a specified number of bot actions for AI decision making and execution.
  description: The ProcessActions method is responsible for executing a set of AI
    actions for a bot within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates the current state
    of the bot, determines appropriate actions based on AI logic, and performs those
    actions up to a maximum limit specified by the maxActions parameter. This method
    is typically called during the bot's update cycle to ensure that it responds appropriately
    to game events and maintains proper behavior. The method handles action prioritization,
    cooldown management, and ensures that bots do not perform too many actions in
    a single tick to maintain performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the actual number of actions that were processed during this call.
    This value will be less than or equal to the maxActions parameter, depending on
    how many valid actions were available to execute.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Update Loop
    code: "void Bot::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Process up to 5 actions per update\
      \ tick\n    uint32 processed = sBotActionManager->ProcessActions(5);\n    //\
      \ Continue with other bot logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Action Processing Based on Bot State
    code: "uint32 BotActionManager::ProcessActions(uint32 maxActions)\n{\n    if (!bot\
      \ || !bot->IsAlive())\n        return 0;\n    \n    uint32 processed = 0;\n\
      \    // Process actions with a maximum of 10 per tick\n    while (processed\
      \ < maxActions && HasAvailableActions())\n    {\n        if (ExecuteNextAction())\n\
      \            ++processed;\n        else\n            break; // No more valid\
      \ actions\n    }\n    return processed;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the main game loop or bot update
    cycle. It's important that bots do not process too many actions per tick, as this
    can cause performance issues. The implementation should consider action cooldowns
    and resource limitations when determining which actions to execute.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very high maxActions value may lead to performance
    degradation or excessive CPU usage. Ensure that the bot's AI logic properly handles
    cases where no valid actions are available, as returning zero processed actions
    is valid but should be handled gracefully by calling code.
