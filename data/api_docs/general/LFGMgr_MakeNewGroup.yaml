documentation:
  brief: Creates a new LFG group based on the provided proposal
  description: The MakeNewGroup method is responsible for forming a new Looking For
    Group (LFG) instance based on a given proposal. This method processes the proposal
    data, which typically contains information about players who have matched together
    for a specific dungeon or activity. It handles the creation of the group, assigns
    roles, and initializes the necessary LFG state for the new group. The method is
    part of TrinityCore's LFG system that manages player matchmaking and group formation
    for various game content such as dungeons, raids, and world events.
  parameters:
  - name: proposal
    description: A const reference to an LfgProposal object containing the details
      of players who have matched together for a group activity. This includes player
      GUIDs, roles, and other relevant group formation data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new LFG group from proposal
    code: 'LfgProposal proposal;

      // ... populate proposal with player data ...

      LFGMgr::instance()->MakeNewGroup(proposal);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LFG system when a group
    proposal has been accepted and validated. It assumes that the proposal contains
    valid data and that all players in the proposal are ready to form a group. The
    method may trigger additional events or notifications to inform players about
    their new group status.
  warnings: This method should only be called with valid, pre-validated LfgProposal
    objects. Passing malformed or incomplete proposals could lead to undefined behavior
    or group creation failures. Ensure that all players in the proposal have proper
    LFG state and are eligible for the requested activity.
