documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AI behavior for a Unit, setting up internal state and subsystems
    required for AI operation.
  description: The InitializeAI method is responsible for setting up and initializing
    the artificial intelligence subsystem for a Unit object. This method is typically
    called during the creation or activation of an AI-controlled entity such as a
    creature or NPC. It configures the AI's internal state, registers necessary callbacks,
    initializes behavior trees or state machines, and prepares the unit to respond
    to environmental stimuli and game events. The method ensures that all required
    AI components are properly instantiated before the unit begins executing its AI
    logic. This initialization process is crucial for proper AI functionality and
    should only be called once per unit during its lifetime.

  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Initialization
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...; // Get a creature instance

      creature->AI()->InitializeAI(); // Initialize the AI subsystem'
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Initialization in Custom AI Class
    code: "class MyCustomAI : public UnitAI {\npublic:\n    void InitializeAI() override\
      \ {\n        UnitAI::InitializeAI(); // Call base implementation\n        //\
      \ Custom initialization code here\n        m_initialized = true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during a unit's lifetime. It is typically
    invoked automatically by the core engine when a creature with AI is spawned, but
    may also be called manually in custom implementations. The initialization process
    includes setting up internal data structures and registering event handlers, so
    performance considerations should be taken into account if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling InitializeAI multiple times on the same unit can lead to undefined
    behavior or memory leaks. Do not call this method after the AI has already been
    initialized. Avoid calling it from within AI update loops as it may cause recursion
    issues.
