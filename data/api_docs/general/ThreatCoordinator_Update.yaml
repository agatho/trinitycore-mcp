documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat coordination system to process and manage enemy target
    selection and aggro mechanics.
  description: The Update method in ThreatCoordinator is responsible for processing
    the current state of threat generation and management within a creature's AI system.
    It handles updating threat lists, determining target priorities, and managing
    the overall threat dynamics between the creature and its enemies. This method
    is typically called during each AI update cycle to ensure that the creature's
    targeting behavior remains consistent with the evolving combat situation. The
    method processes all active threats and may trigger changes in the creature's
    target selection based on current threat levels, player actions, or other combat-related
    factors.

  - title: Basic AI Update Call
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    threatCoordinator.Update(diff);\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the creature's AI update cycle.
    It is typically invoked from within the CreatureAI::UpdateAI() method with the
    time difference since last update. The implementation may involve iterating through
    all threat entries and performing calculations to determine optimal target selection.
