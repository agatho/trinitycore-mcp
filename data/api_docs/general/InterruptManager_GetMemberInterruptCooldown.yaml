  class: InterruptManager
  method: GetMemberInterruptCooldown
  signature: uint32 InterruptManager::GetMemberInterruptCooldown(int memberGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interrupt cooldown duration for a specified group member.
  description: The GetMemberInterruptCooldown method returns the current interrupt
    cooldown value in milliseconds for a given group member identified by their GUID.
    This cooldown represents the time period during which the member cannot be interrupted
    by spells or abilities. The method is typically used within group-based gameplay
    mechanics such as raids or dungeons where managing interrupt timing is crucial
    for successful encounters. It ensures that players do not spam interrupts too
    frequently, maintaining game balance and preventing exploit scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the group member whose interrupt
      cooldown is being queried. This should be a valid player GUID from the World
      of Warcraft database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the remaining interrupt cooldown time
    in milliseconds. A return value of 0 indicates that the member is currently not
    on cooldown and can be interrupted immediately.
  examples:
  - title: Check Interrupt Cooldown for Group Member
    code: "uint32 cooldown = interruptManager->GetMemberInterruptCooldown(playerGuid);\n\
      if (cooldown == 0)\n{\n    // Player can be interrupted\n    // Proceed with\
      \ interrupt logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is on cooldown\n    // Delay interrupt\
      \ action by 'cooldown' milliseconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Implement Interrupt Timing Logic
    code: "void HandleInterruptAttempt(Player* caster, uint32 targetGuid)\n{\n   \
      \ uint32 cooldown = interruptManager->GetMemberInterruptCooldown(targetGuid);\n\
      \    if (cooldown == 0)\n    {\n        // Allow interrupt\n        caster->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_INTERRUPT, true);\n        // Apply new cooldown\n        interruptManager->SetMemberInterruptCooldown(targetGuid,\
      \ 1500); // 1.5 second cooldown\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Inform player\
      \ they're on cooldown\n        WorldPacket data(SMSG_CAST_FAILED, 4);\n    \
      \    data << uint32(0) << uint32(SPELL_FAILED_INTERRUPTED);\n        caster->SendDirectMessage(&data);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the InterruptManager class which manages interrupt-related
    cooldowns for group members. The returned value represents a real-time cooldown
    that may vary based on game state, player actions, or server configuration. It's
    important to note that this method does not modify any internal state; it only
    retrieves the current cooldown value.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided memberGuid is valid and corresponds to an actual
    player in the group to avoid unexpected behavior. This method should not be used
    outside of appropriate group contexts as it may return incorrect values for non-group
    members.
