  class: AoEZone
  method: IsPositionInDanger
  signature: bool AoEZone::IsPositionInDanger(const int & pos, uint32 currentTime)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is within the dangerous area of an AoE
    zone at the specified time.
  description: The IsPositionInDanger method evaluates if a specific position, represented
    by an integer identifier (pos), falls within the hazardous bounds of an Area of
    Effect (AoE) zone at a given moment in time. This method is typically used in
    game mechanics to determine player safety or threat assessment for abilities that
    affect multiple targets. It checks against internal zone boundaries and timing
    constraints to return a boolean result indicating whether the position is currently
    considered dangerous. The method requires a valid position identifier and current
    time to perform its evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a position within the game world.
      This value typically corresponds to a specific location or target that needs
      to be checked for danger.
  - name: currentTime
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the current timestamp in milliseconds.
      This parameter is used to determine if the AoE zone is active at the specified
      time.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is currently within the dangerous
    area of the AoE zone, false otherwise. The result depends on both the position's
    location relative to the zone and whether the zone is active at the given time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (aoeZone.IsPositionInDanger(playerPosition, WorldTimer::getMSTime()))\
      \ {\n    // Player is in danger\n    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_DANGER_ZONE_DAMAGE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Time Checking
    code: "uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\nif (aoeZone.IsPositionInDanger(targetPos,\
      \ currentTime) && aoeZone.GetDuration() > 0) {\n    // Position is dangerous\
      \ and zone is active\n    DoDamageOverTime(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs spatial calculations to determine if the position
    lies within the AoE zone's boundaries. It may cache previous evaluations for performance
    reasons, especially in high-frequency scenarios such as player movement or spell
    targeting. The 'pos' parameter should represent a valid game world coordinate
    or target identifier.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'pos' parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual
    position in the game world. Invalid positions could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical
    code paths as repeated spatial calculations may impact frame rate.
