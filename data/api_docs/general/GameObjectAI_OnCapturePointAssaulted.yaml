  method: OnCapturePointAssaulted
  signature: bool GameObjectAI::OnCapturePointAssaulted(Player * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player assaults a capture point controlled by the
    GameObjectAI.
  description: This method is invoked when a player successfully assaults a capture
    point associated with the GameObject. It allows the GameObjectAI to respond to
    the assault event, potentially triggering visual effects, sound cues, or modifying
    the state of the capture point. The return value indicates whether the assault
    was handled successfully by the AI implementation. This method is typically used
    in battlegrounds or world events where control over strategic locations is important.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object who assaulted the capture point.
  returns: Returns true if the assault event was successfully handled by the GameObjectAI,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the AI did not process
    the event or encountered an error during handling.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation
    code: "bool GameObjectAI::OnCapturePointAssaulted(Player* player)\n{\n    // Play\
      \ a sound effect when capture point is assaulted\n    SendGameObjectCustomAnim(0);\n\
      \    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Implementation with State Change
    code: "bool GameObjectAI::OnCapturePointAssaulted(Player* player)\n{\n    if (!player)\n\
      \        return false;\n    \n    // Update capture point state\n    SetGameObjectState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n\
      \    \n    // Send message to players in area\n    Map* map = GetMap();\n  \
      \  if (map)\n    {\n        map->SendZoneText(player->GetZoneId(), \"Capture\
      \ Point Assaulted!\");\n    }\n    \n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObjectAI system and should be overridden in
    custom AI implementations. The GameObject must be properly initialized with capture
    point functionality for this method to be called. Be aware that multiple players
    may assault a single capture point simultaneously, so proper synchronization might
    be required.
  warnings: Ensure that all pointers passed to this method are validated before use.
    Do not assume the GameObject is in a valid state when this method is called. Improper
    handling of this event could lead to visual inconsistencies or game state corruption.
