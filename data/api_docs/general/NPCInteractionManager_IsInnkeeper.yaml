documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given creature is an innkeeper NPC.
  description: The IsInnkeeper method checks if the specified Creature object represents
    an innkeeper within the World of Warcraft game world. This utility function is
    commonly used in NPC interaction logic to identify which NPCs can provide services
    such as resting, saving position, or accessing player housing. The method evaluates
    the creature's entry ID against a predefined list or database table of innkeeper
    types. It returns true if the creature is recognized as an innkeeper, and false
    otherwise. This check is essential for proper quest progression and player experience,
    particularly in areas where innkeepers are required to complete certain objectives.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided Creature object is classified as an innkeeper;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (NPCInteractionManager::IsInnkeeper(npc)) {\n    // Handle innkeeper-specific\
      \ interactions\n    player->SendNPCLoginMessage(\"Welcome to the inn!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Logic
    code: "void Player::OnGossipHello(Creature* npc) {\n    if (NPCInteractionManager::IsInnkeeper(npc))\
      \ {\n        AddGossipItemFor(player, GOSSIP_ICON_INTERACT_1, \"Rest here\"\
      , GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 1);\n    }\n    SendGossipMenuFor(player, DEFAULT_GOSSIP_MESSAGE,\
      \ npc->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal database lookups or predefined constants
    to identify innkeeper entries. It may be optimized for frequent calls in player
    interaction contexts, but performance should be considered when used in high-frequency
    loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent null pointer dereferences. The method assumes proper initialization of
    NPC data and may not behave correctly if called on unspawned or invalid creatures.
