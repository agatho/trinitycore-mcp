  class: Map
  method: RemoveCreatureFromMoveList
  signature: void Map::RemoveCreatureFromMoveList(Creature * c)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a creature from the map's movement update list.
  description: The RemoveCreatureFromMoveList method removes a specified creature
    from the internal movement update list of the Map object. This is typically called
    when a creature is being removed from the world, such as during despawn or removal
    from the game environment. The method ensures that the creature will no longer
    be processed for movement updates during the next map update cycle. This operation
    is essential for maintaining performance and preventing memory leaks by ensuring
    that non-existent or inactive creatures are not included in movement processing.
  parameters:
  - name: c
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that should be removed from the movement
      update list. Must be a valid pointer to an existing creature, otherwise behavior
      is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Creature* myCreature = ...; // Assume this points to a valid creature

      map->RemoveCreatureFromMoveList(myCreature);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage During Creature Despawn
    code: "void OnCreatureDespawn(Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature && creature->GetMap())\n\
      \    {\n        creature->GetMap()->RemoveCreatureFromMoveList(creature);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    creatures are removed from the world. It's important to ensure that the Creature
    pointer passed is valid and that the creature has been properly removed from any
    other systems before calling this method. The removal operation is not immediate
    but will take effect in the next movement update cycle.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or a pointer to an already freed creature can lead
    to undefined behavior. Always verify that the creature exists and is valid before
    calling this method. This method should only be called when you are certain the
    creature will no longer need movement updates.
