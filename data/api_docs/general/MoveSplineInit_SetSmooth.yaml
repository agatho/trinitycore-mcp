  method: SetSmooth
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetSmooth()
documentation:
  brief: Configures the movement spline to use smooth interpolation for pathfinding.
  description: The SetSmooth method initializes the MoveSplineInit object to use smooth
    spline interpolation when calculating movement paths. This ensures that character
    movement appears fluid and natural rather than linear or jagged. The method is
    typically called before setting waypoints or destination points for a unit's movement.
    It affects how the spline handles intermediate points and the overall trajectory
    of the movement, making it suitable for realistic NPC behavior and player character
    animations.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to enable smooth movement
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init;

      init.SetSmooth();

      // Further setup with waypoints or destination

      init.MoveTo(destination);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any movement-related operations to ensure
    the spline uses smooth interpolation. The effect is applied immediately and affects
    all subsequent movement calculations within the same MoveSplineInit instance.
