documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a DB2StorageBase object to another DB2StorageBase instance.
  description: The DB2StorageBase move constructor transfers all resources from the
    source DB2StorageBase object to the current object, leaving the source in a valid
    but unspecified state. This is a fundamental part of C++'s move semantics, enabling
    efficient resource transfer without deep copying. In the context of TrinityCore's
    database storage system, this allows for optimized handling of large data structures
    that store game content definitions (like creature templates, item prototypes,
    etc.) loaded from DB2 files. The operation is typically used internally during
    container operations or when passing DB2StorageBase objects by value in performance-critical
    code paths.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'DB2StorageBase storage1;

      // ... populate storage1 with data ...

      DB2StorageBase storage2 = std::move(storage1); // Moves resources from storage1
      to storage2

      // storage1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<DB2StorageBase> storages;

      DB2StorageBase newStorage;

      // ... populate newStorage ...

      storages.push_back(std::move(newStorage)); // Efficiently transfers ownership
      to vector

      // newStorage is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is implicitly defined as deleted if the class manages resources
    that cannot be moved. The move constructor should only be called with an rvalue
    reference (temporary object or std::move() result). After moving, the source object
    must not be used in a way that would access its former resources.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure all references to the source object are discarded immediately
    after the move. This constructor is typically not called directly but rather through
    move semantics in C++.
