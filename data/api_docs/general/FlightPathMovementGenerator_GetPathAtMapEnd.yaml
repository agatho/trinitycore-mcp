documentation:
  brief: Returns the path index at which the flight path ends at the map boundary
  description: The GetPathAtMapEnd method retrieves the index of the last waypoint
    in the flight path that lies within the current map boundaries. This is used internally
    by the FlightPathMovementGenerator to determine where a flight path should end
    when it reaches the edge of the current map. The returned value represents an
    index into the flight path's waypoints array, indicating the final valid point
    before the path exits the map. This method is crucial for proper flight path handling
    when players are near map borders and ensures that movement doesn't continue beyond
    the intended map boundary.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the index of the last waypoint in the flight
    path that is within the current map. Returns 0 if no valid waypoints exist or
    if the path has ended before reaching the map boundary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine flight path endpoint
    code: "uint32 endPathIndex = movementGenerator->GetPathAtMapEnd();\nif (endPathIndex\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the last valid waypoint in the current map\n    printf(\"\
      Flight path ends at waypoint index: %u\\n\", endPathIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during flight path processing when determining
    whether a player's movement should continue or stop at a map boundary. The returned
    index can be used to adjust the movement generator's internal state to prevent
    invalid movement beyond map limits.
