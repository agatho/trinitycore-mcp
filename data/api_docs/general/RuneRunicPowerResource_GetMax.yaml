  class: RuneRunicPowerResource
  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 RuneRunicPowerResource::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum runic power value for a player's rune resource.
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the maximum possible runic power value
    that can be stored in a player's rune resource. This value represents the upper
    limit of how much runic power a player can accumulate, which is typically tied
    to the number of runes available and their configuration. The returned value is
    used internally by the game engine to cap runic power accumulation and determine
    resource limits during gameplay mechanics such as rune regeneration and ability
    usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum runic power that can be stored
    in the player's rune resource. This value typically corresponds to the total capacity
    of all active runes combined, with each rune contributing a fixed amount towards
    the maximum limit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 maxRunicPower = player->GetRuneRunicPowerResource()->GetMax();

      // Returns the maximum runic power capacity for the player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Resource Capacity
    code: "RuneRunicPowerResource* resource = player->GetRuneRunicPowerResource();\n\
      uint32 current = resource->GetCurrent();\nuint32 maximum = resource->GetMax();\n\
      if (current >= maximum)\n{\n    // Player's runic power is at maximum capacity\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during resource management operations and
    should be used in conjunction with other rune-related methods to maintain proper
    resource state. The returned value may vary depending on the player's class, level,
    and equipped gear that affects rune capacity.
