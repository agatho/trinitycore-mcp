  class: Battlefield
  method: HandlePlayerEnterZone
  signature: void Battlefield::HandlePlayerEnterZone(Player * player, int zone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles a player entering a specific zone within a battlefield, updating
    their battlefield status and related systems.
  description: The HandlePlayerEnterZone method is responsible for managing the logic
    that occurs when a player enters a designated zone within a battlefield. This
    includes updating the player's battlefield state, triggering relevant events,
    and ensuring proper synchronization of game data such as faction status, objectives,
    and player tracking. The method typically integrates with the broader battlefield
    system to maintain accurate battlefield conditions and player engagement. It is
    invoked automatically by the game engine when a player's position changes into
    a battlefield zone, and it ensures that the player's actions and state are correctly
    reflected within the context of the ongoing battlefield.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who entered
      the zone. Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will cause undefined
      behavior.
  - name: zone
    description: Integer identifier representing the specific zone within the battlefield
      that the player has entered. Zone IDs are defined by the battlefield system
      and correspond to distinct areas such as capture points or control zones.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom event handler
    code: "void MyBattlefieldHandler::OnPlayerEnterZone(Player* player, int zoneId)\n\
      {\n    battlefield->HandlePlayerEnterZone(player, zoneId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with a custom battlefield implementation
    code: "class CustomBattlefield : public Battlefield\n{\npublic:\n    void HandlePlayerEnterZone(Player*\
      \ player, int zone) override\n    {\n        // Custom logic before calling\
      \ base class\n        if (player->GetTeamId() == TEAM_ALLIANCE)\n          \
      \  player->AddAura(SPELL_ALLIANCE_BATTLEFIELD_AURA, player);\n        \n   \
      \     // Call parent implementation\n        Battlefield::HandlePlayerEnterZone(player,\
      \ zone);\n        \n        // Custom logic after\n        UpdateBattlefieldStatus(player);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core game engine when a player's
    position changes into a battlefield zone. It assumes that the player and zone
    parameters are valid and properly initialized. The method may trigger additional
    callbacks or events within the battlefield system, such as updating objective
    states or notifying other subsystems about player presence.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the player parameter will result in a crash
    or undefined behavior. Zone IDs must be valid identifiers defined by the battlefield
    system; invalid zone IDs may cause unexpected behavior or errors during processing.
