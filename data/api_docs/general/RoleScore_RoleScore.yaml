  method: RoleScore
  signature: void RoleScore::RoleScore(GroupRole r)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the role score for a player based on their group role assignment.
  description: The RoleScore method assigns a numerical score to a player's role within
    a group context. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to evaluate and manage player roles such as tank, healer, or damage
    dealer. The role score can influence various gameplay mechanics including loot
    distribution, quest rewards, and group composition balancing. The method takes
    a GroupRole parameter that defines the specific role being assigned.
  parameters:
  - name: r
    description: The group role to assign to the player. Valid values include GROUP_ROLE_TANK,
      GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE, and other role constants defined in the
      TrinityCore API.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Tank Role
    code: RoleScore(GroupRole::GROUP_ROLE_TANK);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a Damage Dealer Role
    code: RoleScore(GroupRole::GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player role tracking systems and
    may update related statistics or performance metrics. The actual implementation
    details depend on how TrinityCore manages group roles and player assignments.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupRole parameter is valid to prevent undefined behavior.
    Improper role assignment may affect gameplay balance or cause unexpected behavior
    in group-based systems.
