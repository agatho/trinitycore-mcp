  class: LootCoordination
  method: AdaptCoordinationStrategy
  signature: void LootCoordination::AdaptCoordinationStrategy(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Adapts the loot coordination strategy based on the provided group's current
    state and configuration.
  description: The AdaptCoordinationStrategy method adjusts the loot distribution
    approach used by the LootCoordination system according to the characteristics
    and settings of the specified group. This includes evaluating group composition,
    loot rules, and player preferences to determine the most appropriate coordination
    mechanism for distributing loot items among group members. The method ensures
    that loot is handled consistently with the group's configuration and maintains
    proper synchronization between players during loot decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose state and configuration will be
      used to adapt the loot coordination strategy. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adapting Loot Coordination for a Group
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    lootCoordination->AdaptCoordinationStrategy(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a group's composition changes or when
    new loot rules are applied. It may trigger internal updates to the loot coordination
    state and should be invoked before any loot distribution decisions are made.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes in the
    loot coordination system.
