  class: Spell
  method: GetExecuteLogEffect
  signature: SpellLogEffect & Spell::GetExecuteLogEffect(int effect)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the execute log effect for a specified spell effect index.
  description: This method retrieves the SpellLogEffect structure associated with
    a specific spell effect index from the spell's execution log. It is used to access
    detailed information about how a spell's effects are logged and processed during
    execution, particularly in the context of World of Warcraft's combat system. The
    method allows developers to examine the effects that were applied during spell
    execution, including their type, value, and other relevant data. This functionality
    is crucial for understanding spell mechanics and debugging spell behavior within
    TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to the SpellLogEffect structure corresponding to the
    specified effect index. The returned structure contains detailed information about
    the effect, including its type, value, and other relevant parameters that define
    how the effect was executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      SpellLogEffect& effect = spell->GetExecuteLogEffect(0);

      // Access effect data

      std::cout << "Effect type: " << effect.Type << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Spell execution log system and should be used
    carefully when debugging spell behavior. It requires that the spell has been executed
    previously to have valid data. The returned reference may be invalid if the effect
    index does not exist or if the spell hasn't been properly initialized.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with non-existent effect indices, as
    it could lead to undefined behavior or access violations. Ensure that the spell
    has been executed before calling this method to avoid potential errors.
