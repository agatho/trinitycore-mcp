  brief: Coordinates group healing for the Monk AI by identifying and targeting nearby
    allies requiring healing.
  description: The CoordinateGroupHealing method in the MonkAI class is responsible
    for managing the AI's group healing behavior. It evaluates the health status of
    nearby party or raid members and determines which targets require immediate healing
    attention. The method typically prioritizes allies with low health, considers
    the monk's available healing abilities, and may factor in cooldowns or resource
    management. This functionality is essential for maintaining group survivability
    during encounters and supports the monk's role as a healer within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method operates within the context of the AI's decision-making
    loop and integrates with other healing-related systems such as target selection
    and spell casting.

  - title: Basic Usage in Monk AI Context
    code: "void MyMonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n \
      \   CoordinateGroupHealing();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle and may involve
    complex targeting logic. It assumes that the AI has access to a valid group/raid
    context and that target selection mechanisms are properly initialized. Performance
    considerations include avoiding excessive iterations over group members when determining
    healing priorities.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method could lead to inefficient healing
    behavior or incorrect target selection. Ensure that the AI's target list is properly
    maintained and that healing cooldowns are correctly handled to prevent spamming
    of healing spells.
