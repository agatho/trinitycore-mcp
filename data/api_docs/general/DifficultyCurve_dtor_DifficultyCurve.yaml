  class: DifficultyCurve
  method: ~DifficultyCurve
  signature: void DifficultyCurve::~DifficultyCurve()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DifficultyCurve instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~DifficultyCurve destructor is automatically invoked when a DifficultyCurve
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the difficulty
    curve data structure. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, difficulty
    curves are used to define how various game mechanics scale with different difficulty
    levels, such as enemy health, damage, and experience rewards. The destructor guarantees
    that no memory leaks occur when these objects are destroyed, maintaining the stability
    of the server's resource management system.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of DifficultyCurve object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    DifficultyCurve curve;\n    // ... use curve\
      \ ...\n    // curve is automatically destroyed here when it goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of DifficultyCurve pointer
    code: 'DifficultyCurve* curve = new DifficultyCurve();

      // ... use curve ...

      delete curve; // Triggers the destructor

      curve = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects go out
    of scope. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The DifficultyCurve class likely manages internal
    data structures that require proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
  warnings: Do not manually call the destructor unless you're implementing a custom
    allocator or memory pool. Calling destructors directly on stack objects can lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure that all references to the object are cleared before
    it is destroyed.
