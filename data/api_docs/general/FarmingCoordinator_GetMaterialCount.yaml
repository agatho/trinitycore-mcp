  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: GetMaterialCount
  signature: uint32 FarmingCoordinator::GetMaterialCount(int * player, uint32 itemId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of a specific material item owned by a player in the
    farming coordinator system.
  description: The GetMaterialCount method is used to determine how many units of
    a particular item ID are currently available to a specified player within the
    FarmingCoordinator framework. This method is typically employed in game systems
    where players collect and manage resources, such as in crafting or farming mechanics.
    It allows the system to check inventory quantities for specific materials required
    for actions like crafting recipes or planting crops. The method takes a pointer
    to a player object and an item identifier, returning the total quantity of that
    item the player possesses. This functionality is essential for validating resource
    availability before performing operations that require specific material inputs.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the player object whose inventory is being queried.
      This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid Player instance
      within the game world.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which the count is requested.
      This corresponds to the item's entry in the game's database and represents a
      specific material type, such as herbs, ores, or crops.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total quantity of the specified
    item currently possessed by the player. If the player has no instances of the
    item, or if the item ID is invalid, the method returns zero.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Material Count for Crafting
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is initialized\nuint32 ironOreCount\
      \ = farmingCoordinator->GetMaterialCount(player, 12345);\nif (ironOreCount >=\
      \ 10) {\n    // Proceed with crafting operation\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Material Count in Farming Logic
    code: "uint32 cropSeedCount = farmingCoordinator->GetMaterialCount(player, 67890);\n\
      if (cropSeedCount > 0) {\n    // Allow player to plant crops\n    player->AddItem(67890,\
      \ cropSeedCount); // Replenish if needed\n} else {\n    // Notify player they\
      \ need more seeds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the assumption that the player object passed in is
    valid and properly initialized within the game world. The FarmingCoordinator class
    likely maintains internal state tracking of player inventories, so this method
    may involve database or cache lookups depending on implementation details. Performance
    considerations should be taken into account when calling this method frequently
    during gameplay loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before invoking this method
    to prevent runtime crashes. Also, be aware that item IDs must correspond to valid
    entries in the game's item database; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur.
    Avoid using this method in performance-critical sections without considering potential
    caching strategies.
