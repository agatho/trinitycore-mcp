  class: Conversation
  method: RelocateStationaryPosition
  signature: void Conversation::RelocateStationaryPosition(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the stationary position of a conversation object to a new location.
  description: The RelocateStationaryPosition method adjusts the fixed positional
    coordinates of a conversation entity within the game world. This function is typically
    used when a conversation needs to be repositioned dynamically, such as when a
    quest objective changes location or when a dialogue sequence must occur at a different
    spatial point. The method modifies the internal position state of the conversation
    object without affecting other properties like NPC associations or dialogue content.
    It's important to note that this operation only affects the stationary positioning
    and does not influence active dialogues or player interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The new positional index or coordinate value that defines where the
      conversation should be relocated. This parameter typically represents an internal
      identifier or offset within the conversation's spatial data structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Relocating a stationary conversation to a new position
    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectAccessor->GetConversation(12345);\nif (conv)\n\
      {\n    conv->RelocateStationaryPosition(7);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in quest and dialogue systems where dynamic
    positioning of conversation elements is required. The positional index 'pos' should
    be validated against valid ranges to prevent out-of-bounds errors. Performance-wise,
    this operation is lightweight as it only updates internal position data.
  warnings: Using invalid position values may lead to undefined behavior or visual
    glitches in the conversation system. Ensure that the provided position value corresponds
    to a valid location within the conversation's spatial context before calling this
    method.
