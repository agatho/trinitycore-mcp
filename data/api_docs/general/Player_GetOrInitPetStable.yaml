  class: Player
  method: GetOrInitPetStable
  signature: int & Player::GetOrInitPetStable()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the pet stable slot index for the player's current pet.
  description: This method retrieves the stable slot index associated with the player's
    current pet, or initializes it if no pet exists. The method is used to determine
    which stable slot a pet occupies within the player's pet system. It returns an
    integer reference that represents the stable slot number, allowing for direct
    manipulation of the pet's position in the stable. This functionality is essential
    for managing pet ownership and maintaining consistency in pet-related game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer reference representing the stable slot index where the
    player's current pet is stored. If no pet exists, it initializes the slot to 0,
    indicating that the pet has not been assigned to any stable slot yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int & stableSlot = player->GetOrInitPetStable();\nif (stableSlot >= 0)\n\
      {\n    // Pet is in a valid stable slot\n    std::cout << \"Pet is in slot:\
      \ \" << stableSlot << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may initialize the pet's stable slot if it hasn't been assigned
    yet, making this function essential for maintaining proper pet state tracking.
    It should be used carefully when managing pet ownership and stability.
  warnings: This method may return a reference to an uninitialized value if no pet
    exists, potentially leading to undefined behavior if not handled properly. Ensure
    that the returned reference is checked before use.
