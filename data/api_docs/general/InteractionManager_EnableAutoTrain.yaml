  class: InteractionManager
  method: EnableAutoTrain
  signature: void InteractionManager::EnableAutoTrain(Player * bot, bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables auto-training for a specified bot player.
  description: The EnableAutoTrain method controls whether a bot player will automatically
    train its skills and abilities when appropriate. This functionality is typically
    used in automated AI systems to manage character progression without manual intervention.
    When enabled, the bot will attempt to train skills based on available skill points
    and training requirements. The method operates on a per-player basis and does
    not affect other players or NPCs. It's commonly used in TrinityCore's AI scripting
    system for managing automated gameplay behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose auto-training
      state will be modified. Must not be null.
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      auto-training for the specified bot.
  returns: None. This method returns void and does not provide any return value.
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Training for a Bot
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player

      InteractionManager::EnableAutoTrain(myBot, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto-Training for a Bot
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player

      InteractionManager::EnableAutoTrain(myBot, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags within the Player object's AI configuration.
    The actual training behavior depends on other factors such as available skill
    points, trainer availability, and character level requirements. Changes made through
    this method are typically applied immediately but may be overridden by other AI
    systems or manual player actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is a valid pointer to avoid undefined behavior.
    This method does not validate whether the player is actually a bot or if auto-training
    is appropriate for the current game state. Improper usage could lead to unexpected
    AI behavior or performance issues in automated systems.
