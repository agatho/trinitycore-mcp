  method: CaptureBase
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::CaptureBase(int * player, const int & baseLocation)
documentation:
  brief: Captures a base location for the battleground team
  description: The CaptureBase method attempts to capture a specified base location
    within a battleground. This method is typically used by battleground AI systems
    to control base capture mechanics, such as those found in Wintergrasp or other
    territorial battlegrounds. It handles the logic for claiming control over a base,
    updating the battleground state, and potentially triggering related events like
    resource generation or objective completion. The method requires a player reference
    and a base location identifier to determine which base to capture.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID attempting to capture
      the base. This parameter is used to identify which player is performing the
      capture action.
  - name: baseLocation
    description: Reference to an integer representing the specific base location identifier
      within the battleground. This value corresponds to a predefined base in the
      battleground's configuration.
  returns: Returns true if the base was successfully captured, false otherwise. The
    method may return false if the capture conditions are not met, such as insufficient
    player presence or invalid base location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Base Capture
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nint baseId = 2;\nif (bgAI->CaptureBase(&playerId,\
      \ baseId)) {\n    // Base captured successfully\n    printf(\"Base %d captured\
      \ by player %d\\n\", baseId, playerId);\n} else {\n    // Capture failed\n \
      \   printf(\"Failed to capture base %d\\n\", baseId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and should only be called
    from within the context of a battleground. The baseLocation parameter must correspond
    to a valid base defined in the battleground's configuration. The player ID should
    be validated before calling this method to ensure it represents an active player.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in undefined
    behavior or game state corruption. Ensure that the base location is valid and
    the player is part of the battleground before invoking this method.
