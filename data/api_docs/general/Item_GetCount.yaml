documentation:
  brief: Returns the stack count of the item.
  description: The GetCount method retrieves the current stack count of an Item object,
    which represents how many items are in a single stack. This value is crucial for
    understanding item management in World of Warcraft, particularly when dealing
    with item stacking mechanics and inventory systems. The method returns a uint32
    value that indicates the number of items in the stack, with values typically ranging
    from 1 to 9999 depending on the item's properties and game mechanics. This method
    is commonly used in conjunction with other item-related functions to manage item
    quantities within player inventories.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the current stack count of the item,
    where values typically range from 1 to 9999. A value of 1 indicates a single item
    stack, while higher values indicate multiple items in the same stack.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(guid);

      uint32 count = item->GetCount();

      std::cout << "Item count: " << count << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Inventory Management Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(guid);\nif (item->GetCount() > 1)\n\
      {\n    // Handle multiple items in stack\n    std::cout << \"Multiple items\
      \ in stack\" << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle single item\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Single item\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it simply reads a stored value from the item object.
    The method is commonly used in inventory management systems to determine item
    quantities.
  warnings: No significant warnings. However, developers should be aware that this
    method returns the actual stack count, not the maximum stack size, which may differ
    depending on the item's properties and game mechanics.
