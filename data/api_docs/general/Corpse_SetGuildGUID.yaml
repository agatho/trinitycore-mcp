  class: Corpse
  method: SetGuildGUID
  signature: void Corpse::SetGuildGUID(int guildGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the guild GUID associated with this corpse.
  description: The SetGuildGUID method assigns a guild identifier to a Corpse object,
    linking it to a specific guild. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    game mechanics to track which guild a player belonged to at the time of death.
    The method directly modifies an internal member variable of the Corpse class and
    does not perform any validation on the provided GUID value. It is commonly called
    during player death processing or when corpse data is being initialized.
  parameters:
  - name: guildGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the guild to associate with this
      corpse. This should be a valid guild GUID obtained from the game's database
      or guild management system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Guild GUID on Corpse
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = new Corpse();

      corpse->SetGuildGUID(12345);

      // The corpse is now associated with guild ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SetGuildGUID in Player Death Context
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Player object\nCorpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\n\
      if (corpse)\n{\n    Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\n    if (guild)\n   \
      \     corpse->SetGuildGUID(guild->GetId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly sets an internal field without any additional side effects
    or database updates. It is recommended to ensure that the guild GUID being set
    is valid and corresponds to an existing guild in the game world.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent guild GUID may result in incorrect
    data association. This method should not be used with raw integer values unless
    they are confirmed to be valid guild identifiers.
