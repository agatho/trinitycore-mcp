documentation:
  brief: Calculates the heuristic cost estimate between two nodes for pathfinding
    purposes
  description: The CalculateHeuristic method computes an estimated cost from a current
    node to a goal node, typically used in A* pathfinding algorithms. This estimation
    helps prioritize which nodes to explore next during the path search process. The
    method is designed to be fast and efficient, providing a reasonable approximation
    that guides the search toward the goal while ensuring the algorithm remains optimal.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this heuristic is
    crucial for NPC movement and AI navigation through the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: current
    description: The identifier of the current node in the pathfinding graph. This
      represents the starting point for the heuristic calculation.
  - name: goal
    description: The identifier of the goal node in the pathfinding graph. This represents
      the destination point for the heuristic calculation.
  returns: A float value representing the estimated cost from the current node to
    the goal node. Lower values indicate a more promising path toward the goal.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in pathfinding
    code: 'PathfindingManager* manager = ...;

      int currentNode = 100;

      int targetNode = 200;

      float heuristic = manager->CalculateHeuristic(currentNode, targetNode);

      // Use heuristic value to prioritize node exploration in A* algorithm'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with A* pathfinding loop
    code: 'PathfindingManager* manager = ...;

      int current = 100;

      int goal = 200;

      float heuristic = manager->CalculateHeuristic(current, goal);

      // In A* loop: fScore = gScore + heuristic

      // Nodes with lower fScore are explored first'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used as part of a larger pathfinding system and
    should be implemented with an admissible heuristic function to guarantee optimal
    pathfinding results. The exact implementation may vary depending on the specific
    graph representation used by TrinityCore's navigation mesh system.
  warnings: Ensure that the node identifiers passed to this method are valid within
    the current pathfinding context, as invalid nodes could lead to incorrect heuristic
    values or undefined behavior. This method should not be called with nodes that
    do not exist in the active navigation graph.
