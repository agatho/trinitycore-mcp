  class: AugmentationEvoker
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool AugmentationEvoker::CanUseAbility(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified spell can be used by the augmentation evoker.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a given spell ID is available
    for use by the augmentation evoker. This check typically considers factors such
    as spell cooldowns, resource requirements (mana, rage, energy), class restrictions,
    and other game mechanics that determine spell usability. The method returns true
    if the spell can be cast under current conditions, and false otherwise. It's commonly
    used in AI decision-making logic to ensure that only valid abilities are attempted
    during combat or non-combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check for usability. This value
      must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: True if the specified spell can be used by the evoker, false otherwise.
    Returns false if the spell is on cooldown, lacks required resources, or violates
    class-based restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spell availability
    code: "if (evoker->CanUseAbility(12345)) {\n    evoker->CastSpell(target, 12345);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle inability to cast\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI logic for ability selection
    code: "uint32 bestSpell = 0;\nfor (auto spellId : possibleSpells) {\n    if (evoker->CanUseAbility(spellId))\
      \ {\n        bestSpell = spellId;\n        break;\n    }\n}\nif (bestSpell !=\
      \ 0) {\n    evoker->CastSpell(target, bestSpell);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the context of an AI update cycle
    or spell casting logic. It does not perform actual spell casting but merely validates
    if a spell can be cast at that moment. The implementation may involve checking
    internal cooldown timers, resource levels, and targeting restrictions.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId passed to this method is valid and exists in the
    game's database; invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method
    should not be used as a substitute for full spell validation logic which includes
    line of sight checks and target validity.
