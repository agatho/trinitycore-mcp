documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a combat action is beneficial or useful in the current
    AI context
  description: The IsUseful method evaluates if a specific combat action should be
    considered for execution based on the current state of the AI and the bot's target.
    It checks various conditions such as available resources, target status, and situational
    relevance to decide whether performing this action would provide tactical advantage.
    This method is typically called during AI decision-making processes to filter
    out ineffective or counterproductive actions before they are executed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat action is deemed useful or beneficial in the
    current context, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the action
    should be considered for execution by the AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (action.IsUseful(ai)) {\n    action.Execute(ai);\n} else {\n    // Skip\
      \ this action and consider alternatives\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat logic loop
    code: "for (auto& action : combatActions) {\n    if (action.IsUseful(ai)) {\n\
      \        ai->SetCurrentAction(&action);\n        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the current target's health, distance,
    threat level, and bot's own resource state (mana, health, etc.). The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific type of CombatAction being evaluated. It is
    designed to be lightweight for frequent calls during AI processing cycles.
  warnings: The method should not be used as a definitive action executor - it only
    determines usefulness. Always verify that the action can actually be performed
    before execution, as IsUseful does not validate action prerequisites or availability.
