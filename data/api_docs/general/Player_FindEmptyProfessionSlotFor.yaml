  class: Player
  method: FindEmptyProfessionSlotFor
  signature: int32 Player::FindEmptyProfessionSlotFor(uint32 skillId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the index of the first empty profession slot for the specified skill
    ID.
  description: This method searches through a player's profession skill slots to find
    the first available slot that can accommodate the given skill ID. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with the FindEmptyProfessionSlotFor method to determine which
    slot should be used for adding new professions or skill points. The method returns
    -1 if no empty slot is found, indicating that all slots are occupied or the skill
    ID is invalid. This functionality is essential for managing player character progression
    and skill point allocation within World of Warcraft's profession system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the index of the first empty profession slot for the specified
    skill ID, or -1 if no empty slot is found. The return value represents the slot
    index in the player's profession skill list where a new skill can be added.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 slotIndex = player->FindEmptyProfessionSlotFor(123);\nif (slotIndex\
      \ != -1)\n{\n    // Add skill to the found slot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically requires checking against existing skill entries in
    the player's profession list to determine if a slot is truly empty. The method
    may be used internally by TrinityCore during character creation or skill point
    allocation processes.
  warnings: The method should not be called with invalid skill IDs as it may return
    -1 even when slots exist, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about available
    slots.
