  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandlePeriodicEnergizeAuraTick
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandlePeriodicEnergizeAuraTick(Unit * target, Unit *
    caster) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies a periodic energy regeneration effect to the target unit.
  description: The HandlePeriodicEnergizeAuraTick method is responsible for applying
    a periodic energy regeneration aura tick to a target unit. This method is typically
    invoked by the aura system when a periodic energize effect (such as mana regeneration
    from a spell or item) needs to be applied. It calculates and applies the appropriate
    energy gain based on the aura's properties, including the amount of energy to
    regenerate and the type of energy being regenerated (e.g., mana, rage, energy).
    The method ensures that the target unit's energy is updated correctly and any
    relevant game mechanics such as energy limits or cooldowns are respected.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The Unit object that will receive the energy regeneration effect.
      This parameter must be a valid pointer to a Unit instance, typically a player
      or creature.
  - name: caster
    description: The Unit object that is responsible for casting or applying the aura.
      This may be null if the aura was applied without a direct caster, such as from
      an item or environment effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura tick handler
    code: "void MyAuraEffect::HandlePeriodicEnergizeAuraTick(Unit* target, Unit* caster)\
      \ const {\n    if (!target)\n        return;\n    \n    // Apply energy regeneration\n\
      \    target->ModifyPower(POWER_MANA, 50);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal aura handling system and should not be
    called directly from outside the aura framework. The actual energy regeneration
    value is usually determined by the aura's base points or calculated from spell
    properties. Ensure that the target unit supports the power type being regenerated.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are implementing a custom
    aura effect; it is intended to be invoked only by the aura system during periodic
    tick processing. Incorrect handling of the target or caster parameters may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes.
