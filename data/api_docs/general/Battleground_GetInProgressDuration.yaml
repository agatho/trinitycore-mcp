  method: GetInProgressDuration
  signature: int Battleground::GetInProgressDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the elapsed time in seconds since the battleground entered the in-progress
    state
  description: The GetInProgressDuration method calculates and returns the number
    of seconds that have passed since the battleground transitioned from the waiting
    state to the active in-progress state. This duration is typically used to track
    how long a battleground has been active, which can be important for determining
    game mechanics such as respawn timers, objective completion times, or when to
    end the match. The method provides a consistent way to measure active gameplay
    time within the context of a single battleground instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of seconds elapsed since the battleground
    entered its in-progress state. Returns 0 if the battleground has not yet started
    or if the duration cannot be calculated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Duration
    code: "Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(player->GetBattlegroundId());\n\
      if (bg)\n{\n    int duration = bg->GetInProgressDuration();\n    if (duration\
      \ > 300) // 5 minutes\n    {\n        // Perform actions based on long-running\
      \ battleground\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal battleground state tracking and assumes the
    battleground has properly transitioned to an in-progress state. The returned value
    is updated continuously during the battleground's active period.
