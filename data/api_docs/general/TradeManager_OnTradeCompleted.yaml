  notes: This method should only be called after both parties have confirmed their
    trade agreement. It is typically triggered internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a trade is finalized.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are certain that the trade
    has been properly accepted and validated by both players. Incorrect usage may
    lead to inconsistent game state or item loss.
