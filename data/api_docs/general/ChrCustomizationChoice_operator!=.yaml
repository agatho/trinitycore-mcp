documentation:
  brief: Compares two ChrCustomizationChoice objects for inequality
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this ChrCustomizationChoice
    object and another ChrCustomizationChoice object to determine if they are not
    equal. This operator is typically used in conditional statements or container
    operations where it's necessary to check whether two customization choice instances
    differ in their properties such as appearance options, racial traits, or other
    character customization data. The comparison usually involves checking internal
    member variables that define the unique characteristics of a character customization
    option within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The ChrCustomizationChoice object to compare against this instance
  returns: Returns true if the two ChrCustomizationChoice objects are not equal, false
    otherwise. The comparison is based on the internal state of both objects and their
    respective customization parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check
    code: "ChrCustomizationChoice choice1;\nChrCustomizationChoice choice2;\n\nif\
      \ (choice1 != choice2) {\n    // Handle case where choices are different\n \
      \   printf(\"Choices are not equal\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in container search
    code: "std::vector<ChrCustomizationChoice> choices;\nChrCustomizationChoice targetChoice;\n\
      \n// Find first choice that is not equal to target\nauto it = std::find_if(choices.begin(),\
      \ choices.end(),\n    [&targetChoice](const ChrCustomizationChoice& choice)\
      \ {\n        return choice != targetChoice;\n    });"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is likely implemented using a member-wise comparison of the
    object's data fields. It's important to note that this comparison may involve
    complex data structures related to character appearance and customization options,
    which could impact performance if used extensively in tight loops or frequent
    comparisons.
  warnings: Be aware that comparing objects with different types or uninitialized
    objects might lead to undefined behavior. Ensure both objects are properly initialized
    before performing inequality checks.
