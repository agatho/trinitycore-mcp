  signature: MailStationery MailSender::GetStationery() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the stationery type associated with this mail sender.
  description: The GetStationery method returns the MailStationery enum value that
    represents the visual stationery type used for displaying mail sent by this sender.
    This is typically used to determine how the mail interface should be rendered,
    such as whether it's a regular letter, a guild invitation, or a system message.
    The returned value corresponds to predefined stationery types in the game's mail
    system and affects the appearance of the mail in the client's mailbox interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: A MailStationery enum value indicating the type of stationery used for
    this mail sender. Possible values include regular letters, guild invitations,
    auction notifications, etc., depending on how the mail was configured in the game
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MailSender sender;\nMailStationery stationery = sender.GetStationery();\n\
      if (stationery == MAIL_STATIONERY_GUILD)\n{\n    // Handle guild mail specifically\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when rendering mail in the client interface
    to determine appropriate visual styling. The stationery type affects how the mail
    appears in the mailbox but does not influence the actual content or functionality
    of the mail message.
