  signature: void EnergyComboResource::Regenerate(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the energy combo resource by regenerating stored energy over time.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for incrementally restoring energy
    combo points for a player or unit based on the elapsed game time. This method
    typically gets invoked during game ticks to simulate natural resource regeneration,
    such as energy or combo points that restore over time. It processes the time difference
    (diff) passed in and applies appropriate regeneration logic according to the class's
    internal state and game mechanics. The method does not directly interact with
    external systems but modifies the internal energy combo resource state.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'EnergyComboResource resource;

      resource.Regenerate(1000); // Regenerates energy over 1 second'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called from the game loop or update system, where
    time deltas are passed in to accurately simulate real-time resource regeneration.
    The actual regeneration rate and behavior depend on class-specific logic and player
    state.
