documentation:
  brief: Returns the off-tank player in the group
  description: The GetOffTank method retrieves the Player object designated as the
    off-tank within the paladin's current group. This method is typically used in
    tanking scenarios where a primary tank and an off-tank are assigned to manage
    threat and positioning. The returned player may be nullptr if no valid off-tank
    is found or if the group structure does not support off-tanking mechanics. The
    method relies on internal tracking of group roles and may return different values
    based on the current group composition and role assignments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object representing the off-tank, or nullptr if
    no valid off-tank is found in the group
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for off-tank
    code: "Player* offTank = paladin->GetOffTank();\nif (offTank != nullptr)\n{\n\
      \    // Proceed with off-tank specific logic\n    SendChatMessage(\"Off-tank\
      \ is: \" + offTank->GetName());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no off-tank\
      \ is assigned\n    SendChatMessage(\"No off-tank assigned.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the paladin is part of a group and relies on TrinityCore's
    group management system to determine role assignments. The implementation may
    vary depending on the specific subclass or specialization of the paladin.
  warnings: The returned Player pointer should always be checked for null before use
    to prevent potential crashes. This method does not validate whether the off-tank
    is still in the same instance or zone as the calling paladin.
