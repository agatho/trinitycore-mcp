  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: HandleDefensivePhase
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::HandleDefensivePhase()
documentation:
  brief: Activates the defensive phase for the combat AI, adjusting behavior to prioritize
    protection and evasion.
  description: The HandleDefensivePhase method is responsible for transitioning the
    CombatAIIntegrator into a defensive state. This typically involves modifying the
    AI's decision-making process to focus on avoiding damage, using defensive abilities,
    and prioritizing survival over aggressive actions. The method may adjust threat
    levels, modify targeting behavior, or enable specific defensive cooldowns based
    on the current combat situation. It is commonly invoked when the AI unit's health
    drops below a certain threshold or when specific combat conditions are met that
    warrant a defensive stance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "void MyCombatHandler::OnLowHealth()\n{\n    m_combatAIIntegrator->HandleDefensivePhase();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI unit is actively engaged in
    combat. It assumes that the AI has already initialized its defensive abilities
    and that the unit's health status supports a defensive strategy.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active combat context may lead to unexpected
    behavior or invalid state transitions. Ensure proper preconditions are met before
    invoking this method.
