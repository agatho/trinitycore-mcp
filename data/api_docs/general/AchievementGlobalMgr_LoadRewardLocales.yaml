  signature: void AchievementGlobalMgr::LoadRewardLocales()
documentation:
  brief: Loads locale-specific reward data for achievements from the database.
  description: The LoadRewardLocales method initializes and populates the internal
    locale data structures used for displaying achievement rewards in different languages.
    This method is typically called during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that all localized achievement reward text, such as item names and descriptions,
    are properly loaded into memory. It retrieves reward-related strings from the
    database tables containing localized content and caches them for efficient access
    during gameplay. The method does not return any value but updates internal state
    necessary for proper localization of achievement rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n\
      \    AchievementGlobalMgr::Instance()->LoadRewardLocales();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with rest of initialization ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and valid. It's typically invoked as part of the global achievement manager's
    initialization sequence. The method performs database queries to fetch locale-specific
    reward data, so performance may be impacted during server startup if there are
    many achievements with rewards.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in the internal locale cache. Ensure that database
    connections are properly initialized before invoking this method.
