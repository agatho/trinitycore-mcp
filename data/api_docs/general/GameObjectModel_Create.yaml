  method: Create
  signature: int GameObjectModel::Create(int modelOwner, const int & dataPath)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and creates a game object model instance for a specified model
    owner and data path.
  description: The Create method is responsible for initializing a GameObjectModel
    instance within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a model owner identifier and
    a reference to a data path, which typically represents the location of model files
    or configuration data. This method sets up internal structures necessary for rendering
    and managing game objects such as doors, furniture, or interactive environment
    elements. The method returns an integer status code indicating success or failure
    of the creation process. It is commonly used during server startup or when dynamically
    spawning game objects with specific visual models.
  parameters:
  - name: modelOwner
    description: An integer identifier representing the owner of the model, typically
      corresponding to a GameObject's GUID or instance ID. This value determines which
      entity owns and manages this model instance.
  - name: dataPath
    description: A constant reference to an integer that represents the path or index
      of the data file associated with this model. This usually corresponds to a lookup
      table entry or resource identifier in the game's model system.
  returns: Returns an integer value where 0 indicates successful creation of the GameObjectModel,
    and any non-zero value typically signifies an error during initialization or resource
    loading. The exact meaning of error codes may vary based on internal implementation
    details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic GameObjectModel Creation
    code: "GameObjectModel* model = new GameObjectModel();\nint result = model->Create(12345,\
      \ dataPath);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Model created successfully\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle error\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Model with Error Handling
    code: "int modelOwner = 98765;\nconst int dataPath = 42;\nGameObjectModel* model\
      \ = new GameObjectModel();\nint status = model->Create(modelOwner, dataPath);\n\
      if (status != 0) {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to create GameObjectModel for\
      \ owner %d\", modelOwner);\n    delete model;\n    return false;\n}\nsLog->outString(\"\
      GameObjectModel created successfully for owner %d\", modelOwner);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core GameObjectModel system in TrinityCore and
    should only be called after ensuring that the necessary model resources are available.
    The dataPath parameter must point to a valid resource entry in the game's database
    or file system. This method does not perform any rendering directly but prepares
    the internal state for later use.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the GameObjectModel
    object may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that modelOwner and dataPath are
    valid before calling, as invalid values can cause crashes or resource corruption.
    Avoid calling Create multiple times on the same instance without proper cleanup.
