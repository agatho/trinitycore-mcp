documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is affected by diminishing returns.
  description: This method checks if a unit is currently subject to diminishing returns,
    which is a game mechanic that reduces the effectiveness of certain effects or
    abilities over time. The method returns true when the unit is affected by diminishing
    returns and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for understanding how
    various abilities interact with the game's diminishing return system, particularly
    in scenarios involving multiple instances of the same effect or ability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is affected by diminishing returns, false otherwise.
    The method may return false if the unit has no active diminishing return effects
    or if the specific type of diminishing return is not applicable to the current
    context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: bool isAffected = unit->IsAffectedByDiminishingReturns();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves checking against specific diminishing return
    groups or types. Implementation details may depend on how the unit's state is
    tracked internally, and could involve complex logic related to effect stacking
    or cooldown management.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in contexts where diminishing returns
    are applied to multiple effects, as incorrect usage can lead to misinterpretation
    of game mechanics and potentially affect gameplay balance.
