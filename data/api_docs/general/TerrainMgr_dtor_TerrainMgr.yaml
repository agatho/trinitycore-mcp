documentation:
  brief: Destroys the TerrainMgr instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~TerrainMgr destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated by the TerrainMgr class. This includes releasing any loaded
    terrain data, deallocating internal buffers, and ensuring proper cleanup of the
    terrain management system. The destructor is automatically called when a TerrainMgr
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no memory
    leaks occur and that all terrain-related systems are properly shut down before
    the object is destroyed. This method is part of the standard C++ RAII (Resource
    Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern used throughout TrinityCore for managing
    system resources.

  - title: Automatic destruction of TerrainMgr instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    TerrainMgr* terrainMgr = new TerrainMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use terrainMgr ...\n    delete terrainMgr; // Destructor called\
      \ here\n}\n\n// Or with automatic storage:\nvoid AnotherFunction()\n{\n    TerrainMgr\
      \ terrainMgr;\n    // ... use terrainMgr ...\n    // Destructor automatically\
      \ called when going out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of TrinityCore's resource management system.
    It ensures that all terrain data loaded into memory is properly freed, preventing
    memory leaks in long-running server instances. The destruction process may involve
    multiple internal cleanup steps including flushing cached terrain data, releasing
    file handles, and notifying other subsystems about the shutdown of terrain services.
  warnings: Developers should never manually call the destructor directly unless they
    are explicitly managing object lifetime through raw pointers. The destructor should
    always be called automatically by the C++ runtime when objects go out of scope
    or are deleted. Manual invocation can lead to undefined behavior if not handled
    carefully.
