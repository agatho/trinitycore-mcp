  class: Battleground
  method: SetArenaType
  signature: void Battleground::SetArenaType(int type)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the arena type for the battleground.
  description: The SetArenaType method configures the type of arena gameplay for a
    battleground instance. This method is typically used during battleground initialization
    or setup to define whether the battleground operates as a standard 2v2, 3v3, or
    5v5 arena match. The arena type affects various game mechanics including team
    sizes, scoring rules, and reward distribution. This setter method modifies internal
    state that determines how the battleground handles player matchmaking, combat
    rules, and victory conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: An integer value representing the arena type. Valid values are typically
      2 for 2v2, 3 for 3v3, and 5 for 5v5 arena formats. The exact numeric mapping
      may vary based on internal TrinityCore implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a 3v3 Arena Type
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      bg->SetArenaType(3);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Arena Type During Battleground Creation
    code: 'Battleground* arena = new Battleground();

      arena->SetArenaType(5);

      arena->SetupBattleground();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before the battleground is started or players
    are added to ensure proper initialization. The arena type affects how player statistics
    and ratings are calculated during and after the match.
  warnings: Calling this method after a battleground has already started may result
    in undefined behavior or inconsistent gameplay mechanics. Always verify that the
    type parameter is within expected bounds before calling.
