  method: ValidateMigrationIntegrity
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ValidateMigrationIntegrity()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the integrity of player bot migration data to ensure consistency
    and correctness before processing.
  description: The ValidateMigrationIntegrity method performs a comprehensive check
    on the player bot migration data within the PlayerbotMigrationMgr class. It verifies
    that all necessary migration records are present, consistent, and correctly formatted
    to prevent errors during the migration process. This method is typically invoked
    before initiating any migration operations to ensure data integrity and avoid
    potential issues such as corrupted or missing player bot configurations. The validation
    includes checking for valid GUIDs, ensuring proper state transitions, and confirming
    that all required fields are populated with correct values. If any inconsistencies
    are detected, the method returns false, indicating that the migration data requires
    manual intervention or correction before proceeding.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all migration integrity checks pass successfully, indicating
    that the player bot migration data is consistent and ready for processing. Returns
    false if any validation failures are detected, signaling that the migration data
    contains inconsistencies or errors that must be resolved before proceeding with
    the migration process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Usage
    code: "if (PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->ValidateMigrationIntegrity()) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with migration\n    PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->StartMigration();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle integrity failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Player bot migration\
      \ data integrity check failed\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only validation and does not modify any migration
    data. It is recommended to call this method before initiating any migration operations
    to prevent runtime errors. The validation process may involve database queries
    and could have performance implications on systems with large numbers of player
    bots.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper error handling can lead to silent failures
    in the migration process. Always check the return value and implement appropriate
    fallback mechanisms when integrity validation fails.
