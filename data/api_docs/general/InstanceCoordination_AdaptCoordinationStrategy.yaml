  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: AdaptCoordinationStrategy
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::AdaptCoordinationStrategy(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Adapts the instance coordination strategy based on the provided group's composition
    and current instance requirements.
  description: The AdaptCoordinationStrategy method adjusts the instance coordination
    behavior for a given group, ensuring optimal resource allocation and player experience
    within the game world. This method evaluates the group's size, member roles, and
    instance-specific constraints to dynamically modify how players are coordinated
    during instance encounters. It is typically invoked when a group enters or exits
    an instance, or when significant changes occur in group composition. The implementation
    may adjust loot distribution methods, encounter difficulty scaling, or player
    positioning strategies based on the group's current state.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose coordination strategy needs to
      be adapted. Must not be null and should represent a valid group with at least
      one member.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Entry
    code: "void OnGroupEnterInstance(Group* group)\n{\n    instanceCoordination.AdaptCoordinationStrategy(group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adapting Strategy After Group Composition Change
    code: "void HandleGroupMemberChange(Group* group)\n{\n    // Remove or add members\n\
      \    instanceCoordination.AdaptCoordinationStrategy(group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger internal state updates that affect other systems
    such as loot management, encounter difficulty, and player positioning. It should
    be called after any significant group modification to maintain optimal gameplay
    experience.
  warnings: Ensure the Group pointer is valid before calling this method; passing
    a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes the
    group has already been validated for instance entry requirements.
