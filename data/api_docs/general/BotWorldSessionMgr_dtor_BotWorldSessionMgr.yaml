  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgr::~BotWorldSessionMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotWorldSessionMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotWorldSessionMgr class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources allocated during the lifetime of the session
    manager. This includes cleaning up any active bot sessions, freeing internal data
    structures, and ensuring proper shutdown of the bot management system. The method
    is automatically invoked when a BotWorldSessionMgr object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no memory leaks occur and that all bot-related
    systems are properly terminated before the manager itself is destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of BotWorldSessionMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotWorldSessionMgr sessionMgr;\n    // ...\
      \ use sessionMgr ...\n    // Destructor called automatically here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should not be called directly unless you are explicitly managing
    the object's lifetime. The destruction process is handled automatically by the
    C++ runtime when the object goes out of scope or is deleted. Ensure that no other
    threads are actively using the session manager during destruction to avoid race
    conditions.
