  method: QuestTurnInData
  signature: void QuestTurnInData::QuestTurnInData(uint32 qId, uint32 bGuid, uint32
    gGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a QuestTurnInData object with quest ID, banker GUID, and gossip
    GUID
  description: The QuestTurnInData constructor initializes a data structure used for
    tracking quest turn-in information in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore emulation.
    This method sets up internal state variables including the quest identifier (qId),
    the GUID of the banker NPC involved in the quest turn-in process, and the GUID
    of the gossip NPC that initiated the interaction. The constructor is typically
    called when processing quest turn-in events to ensure proper tracking of quest
    completion data within the game's quest system. This initialization is crucial
    for maintaining accurate quest state information and ensuring correct quest reward
    distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: qId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being turned in, used to reference
      the specific quest in the database
  - name: bGuid
    description: The GUID of the banker NPC involved in the quest turn-in process,
      typically a quest giver or reward collector
  - name: gGuid
    description: The GUID of the gossip NPC that initiated the quest turn-in interaction,
      used to track the original quest interaction point
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Initialization
    code: 'QuestTurnInData turnInData(12345, 67890, 54321);

      // Initializes a quest turn-in data structure for quest ID 12345

      // with banker GUID 67890 and gossip GUID 54321'
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Turn-In in Quest Giver Context
    code: "void HandleQuestTurnIn(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    uint32 bankerGuid\
      \ = player->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(questId, UNIT_NPC_FLAG_QUESTGIVER);\n  \
      \  uint32 gossipGuid = player->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(questId, UNIT_NPC_FLAG_GOSSIP);\n\
      \    QuestTurnInData turnInData(questId, bankerGuid, gossipGuid);\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest completion logic using turnInData\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore quest system.
    The GUIDs passed should correspond to valid NPC entries in the database. The QuestTurnInData
    object is usually temporary and destroyed after use in quest completion processing.
  warnings: Ensure that all GUID parameters are valid before calling this constructor,
    as invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior during quest turn-in processing.
    This method does not perform validation of the quest ID against the database.
