  class: CooldownCalculator
  method: GetSpellCharges
  signature: uint32 CooldownCalculator::GetSpellCharges(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current charge count for a specified spell's cooldown mechanism.
  description: The GetSpellCharges method retrieves the number of charges currently
    available for a given spell, which is used in conjunction with spell cooldowns
    and charge-based mechanics in World of Warcraft. This functionality is essential
    for determining how many times a spell can be cast before entering a cooldown
    state. The method typically interacts with internal spell tracking systems to
    return accurate charge counts based on the player's current state and any active
    buffs or debuffs that may affect spell charges.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of available charges for
    the specified spell. A return value of 0 indicates no charges are currently available,
    while higher values indicate the number of times the spell can be cast before
    entering cooldown.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Spell Charges
    code: "uint32 charges = cooldownCalculator.GetSpellCharges(12345);\nif (charges\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Spell can be cast\n    // Proceed with spell logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal cooldown tracking data structures and
    may be affected by player state changes such as buff/debuff modifications. It's
    recommended to call this method before attempting to cast a spell to ensure proper
    charge availability.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to an actual spell in the
    game's database, as invalid IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    charge counts. This method should not be called during critical sections of gameplay
    logic where performance is crucial due to potential internal lookups.
