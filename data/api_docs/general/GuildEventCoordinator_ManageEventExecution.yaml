  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: ManageEventExecution
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::ManageEventExecution(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the specified guild event by ID, handling all associated event logic
    and notifications.
  description: The ManageEventExecution method is responsible for processing a guild
    event identified by its unique event ID. This method orchestrates the execution
    flow for guild events, including validating the event state, triggering any necessary
    callbacks or handlers, and managing the distribution of event-related information
    to participating guild members. It serves as the central coordinator for all guild
    event activities within the TrinityCore framework. The method ensures that only
    valid and active events are processed, and it handles the internal state management
    required for event completion or cancellation.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event to be executed. This ID
      must correspond to a valid event registered with the GuildEventCoordinator.
      Valid values are positive integers representing existing guild events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Execution
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.ManageEventExecution(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing Multiple Events in Loop
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\nfor (uint32 eventId : eventIds)\n{\n\
      \    coordinator.ManageEventExecution(eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the event with the given ID exists and is in a valid
    state for execution. It does not perform any validation on the event's existence
    or validity beyond basic parameter checking. The actual event processing logic
    may involve multiple subsystems within TrinityCore, including database operations
    and player communication.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid eventId may result in undefined behavior
    or exceptions. Ensure that all event IDs passed to this method are valid and correspond
    to registered guild events before invocation. This method should not be called
    concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
