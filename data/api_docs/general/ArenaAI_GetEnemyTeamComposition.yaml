  description: The GetEnemyTeamComposition method returns a TeamComposition object

    The method is typically used by arena AI logic to adapt tactics based on the enemy's
    roster composition.
  parameters: []
  returns: A TeamComposition object representing the structure and makeup of the enemy
    team in the current arena match, including class distribution and player counts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena AI
    code: "TeamComposition enemyComp = arenaAI->GetEnemyTeamComposition();\nif (enemyComp.GetPlayerCount()\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Analyze enemy composition for strategy\n    uint32 tankCount\
      \ = enemyComp.GetClassCount(CLASS_WARRIOR);\n    uint32 healerCount = enemyComp.GetClassCount(CLASS_PRIEST);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ArenaAI class and should only be called during
    active arena matches. The returned TeamComposition object is valid only for the
    duration of the current match and may become stale if the enemy team composition
    changes.
