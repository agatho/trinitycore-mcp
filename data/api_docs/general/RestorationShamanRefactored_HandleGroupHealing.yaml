documentation:
  brief: Performs group healing for the shaman's assigned group
  description: The HandleGroupHealing method executes the core logic for a restoration
    shaman to heal all members of their current group. This method typically triggers
    the shaman's group healing ability, which may involve casting a healing spell
    or applying a healing effect to all group members within range. The method returns
    true if the healing was successfully initiated and false otherwise. It is designed
    to work with the TrinityCore framework's group management system and player state
    tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier that specifies which group should receive the
      healing effect. This parameter determines the target group for the healing spell.
  returns: Returns true if the group healing was successfully initiated and applied
    to all group members, false if the operation failed or could not be performed
    due to invalid conditions such as no valid group or insufficient mana.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Healing Usage
    code: "if (shaman->HandleGroupHealing(player->GetGroup()->GetId())) {\n    //\
      \ Healing successfully applied\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_GROUP_HEALING_STARTED);\n\
      } else {\n    // Healing failed\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_GROUP_HEALING_FAILED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the shaman has a valid group assigned and sufficient
    mana to perform the healing spell. It integrates with TrinityCore's group management
    system and may depend on specific spell cooldowns or resource requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter is valid before calling this method, as
    passing an invalid group ID may lead to undefined behavior or failed healing attempts.
    The method does not validate group membership internally.
