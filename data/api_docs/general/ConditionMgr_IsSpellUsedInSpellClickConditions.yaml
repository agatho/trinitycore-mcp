    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified spell is used in any spell click conditions within
    the game.
  description: The IsSpellUsedInSpellClickConditions method determines if a given
    spell ID is referenced in any spell click conditions defined in the database.
    Spell click conditions are used in World of Warcraft to define interactions between
    creatures and players, typically involving quest rewards or special abilities
    triggered by clicking on NPCs. This method is primarily used internally by the
    ConditionMgr class to validate spell references and ensure consistency in conditional
    logic. The check involves querying internal condition storage structures that
    map spell IDs to their associated click conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell ID is found in any spell click condition,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the spell is referenced
    as a requirement or effect within one or more spell click conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (sConditionMgr->IsSpellUsedInSpellClickConditions(12345)) {\n    //\
      \ Spell 12345 is used in at least one spell click condition\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Spell 12345 is referenced in spell click conditions.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in internal condition data structures. It's
    typically called during server initialization or when validating spell references
    to prevent orphaned or invalid spell conditions. The implementation likely uses
    hash maps or similar fast lookup structures for performance.
