  class: InteractionManager
  method: GetNPCType
  signature: NPCType InteractionManager::GetNPCType(Creature * npc) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the NPC type classification for a given creature object.
  description: The GetNPCType method returns the NPCType enumeration value that represents
    the specific type or category of a Creature object within the TrinityCore framework.
    This classification is used internally by the game engine to determine how NPCs
    should behave, what actions they can perform, and how they interact with players
    and other game entities. The method takes a pointer to a Creature object as input
    and returns its corresponding NPCType value. It's commonly used in AI scripts,
    interaction logic, and quest systems where different types of NPCs require distinct
    handling.
  parameters:
  - name: npc
    description: Pointer to the Creature object for which to retrieve the NPC type
      classification. Must not be null.
  returns: 'Returns an NPCType enumeration value that categorizes the creature''s
    role or behavior within the game world. Possible values include but are not limited
    to: VENDOR, TRAINER, GUILD_MASTER, AUCTIONEER, BANKER, and others depending on
    the specific implementation in TrinityCore.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (Creature* npc = me->ToCreature()) {\n            NPCType\
      \ type = sInteractionManager->GetNPCType(npc);\n            if (type == NPC_TYPE_VENDOR)\
      \ {\n                // Handle vendor-specific behavior\n                DoVendorBehavior();\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking NPC Type for Quest Logic
    code: "bool IsNPCOfType(Creature* npc, NPCType expectedType) {\n    if (!npc)\
      \ return false;\n    NPCType actualType = sInteractionManager->GetNPCType(npc);\n\
      \    return actualType == expectedType;\n}\n\n// Usage example\nif (IsNPCOfType(targetNPC,\
      \ NPC_TYPE_QUESTGIVER)) {\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestGiverHello(targetNPC,\
      \ targetNPC->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal creature data structures and should only be
    called when the Creature object is valid and fully initialized. The returned NPCType
    value directly corresponds to how the creature was defined in the database or
    through scripting, making it essential for proper game logic implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the input Creature pointer is not null before calling this
    method, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior and likely
    crash the server. Additionally, be aware that NPCType values may vary between
    different TrinityCore versions or custom modifications.
