  class: AuctionHouseObject
  method: SendAuctionSold
  signature: void AuctionHouseObject::SendAuctionSold(const AuctionPosting * auction,
    Player * owner, int trans) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends an auction sold message to the auction owner when an item is successfully
    sold.
  description: The SendAuctionSold method is responsible for notifying the player
    who posted an auction that their item has been successfully sold. This method
    is typically called during the auction house processing when an auction concludes
    and a buyer purchases the item. It handles the communication of the sale details
    to the original owner, including the final bid amount and any applicable fees
    or taxes. The method ensures that the auction owner receives proper notification
    of the transaction outcome and can claim their winnings.
  parameters:
  - name: auction
    description: Pointer to the AuctionPosting object representing the auction that
      was sold. Must not be null.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object who owns the auctioned item. Must not
      be null.
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier or type code indicating the nature of the
      auction transaction. Used for tracking purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in auction processing
    code: "void ProcessAuctionSale(AuctionPosting* auction, Player* owner, int transactionId)\
      \ {\n    AuctionHouseObject auctionHouse;\n    auctionHouse.SendAuctionSold(auction,\
      \ owner, transactionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with auction house system
    code: "void AuctionHouseMgr::HandleAuctionSale(AuctionPosting* auction, Player*\
      \ owner) {\n    int transactionType = AUCTION_SALE;\n    SendAuctionSold(auction,\
      \ owner, transactionType);\n    // Additional processing for sale completion\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely sends a packet to the client informing the player about
    the auction sale. It may also update internal auction house state and handle currency
    transfers. The method should only be called when an auction is actually completed
    with a successful bid.
  warnings: Ensure that the auction and owner parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as passing null pointers could cause crashes or undefined
    behavior. The transaction identifier should be properly validated to prevent incorrect
    transaction tracking.
