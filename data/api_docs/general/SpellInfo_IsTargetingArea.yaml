  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsTargetingArea() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell targets an area.
  description: This method checks if a spell is designed to target an area rather
    than a single target. It returns true for spells that affect areas such as AoE
    (Area of Effect) spells, and false for spells that target single units or objects.
    This functionality is crucial for determining spell behavior in World of Warcraft's
    combat system and is used by the game engine to properly handle spell targeting
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell targets an area, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the spell is an area-of-effect type or a single-target type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsTargetingArea()) {\n    // Handle area targeting logic\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal spell data structures and may be used in conjunction
    with other spell-related methods to determine complete targeting behavior. Performance
    impact is minimal as this is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine spell effects directly, as
    it only indicates area targeting, not the actual effect or damage type of the
    spell.
