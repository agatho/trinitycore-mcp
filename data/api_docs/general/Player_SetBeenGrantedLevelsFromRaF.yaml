  class: Player
  method: SetBeenGrantedLevelsFromRaF
  signature: void Player::SetBeenGrantedLevelsFromRaF()
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's been granted levels from RaF flag to true, indicating that
    the player has received level grants through Raid Finder.
  description: This method marks the player as having received level grants through
    the Raid Finder (RaF) system, which is part of the World of Warcraft's progression
    mechanics. It typically occurs when a player completes a Raid Finder instance
    and is granted a level bonus. The method ensures that the player's status reflects
    this achievement, preventing further level grants from being applied to the same
    player in the same session. This functionality is essential for maintaining game
    balance and ensuring proper progression tracking within the RaF system.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetBeenGrantedLevelsFromRaF();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player
    completes a Raid Finder instance. It's important to note that this method does
    not directly grant levels, but rather sets a flag indicating that the player has
    already received their level bonus from RaF.
  warnings: This method should only be called after verifying that the player has
    completed a Raid Finder instance and is eligible for level grants. Calling this
    method without proper verification may lead to incorrect progression tracking
    or game balance issues.
