documentation:
  brief: Updates combat metrics and AI behavior based on elapsed time
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    various combat-related statistics and performance indicators for WarriorAI instances.
    This method typically processes timing-based calculations, updates threat levels,
    manages cooldowns, and adjusts AI decision-making parameters according to the
    time elapsed since the last update. It serves as a core component of the warrior's
    combat behavior system, ensuring that the AI adapts dynamically to changing battlefield
    conditions. The method is usually called by the game engine's main update loop
    at regular intervals.

  - title: Basic UpdateMetrics Call
    code: "void Update() {\n    // Called from main game loop\n    warriorAI->UpdateMetrics(100);\
      \ // 100ms elapsed time\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core game engine's AI update system.
    Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing custom AI
    behavior. The method may perform calculations that affect combat performance and
    should be optimized for frequent execution.
