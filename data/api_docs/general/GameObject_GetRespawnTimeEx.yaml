documentation:
  brief: Returns the respawn time of the game object in seconds since epoch.
  description: The GetRespawnTimeEx method retrieves the exact time when the game
    object will respawn, expressed as a Unix timestamp. This value represents the
    moment when the object's respawn timer ends and the object becomes available for
    spawning again. The method is commonly used in game mechanics to determine when
    objects are ready to be spawned or when they should remain inactive. It provides
    a precise timestamp that can be used for calculating time differences, scheduling
    events, or managing object spawn states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the game object
    will respawn. This value is typically calculated based on the current server time
    plus the respawn delay, and represents the exact moment when the object becomes
    available for spawning again.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "time_t respawnTime = gameObject->GetRespawnTimeEx();\n\nif (respawnTime\
      \ > time(NULL)) {\n    // Object is still waiting to respawn\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Respawn in \" << respawnTime - time(NULL) << \" seconds\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    value is calculated based on the server's current time and the object's respawn
    delay, making it suitable for use in time-sensitive calculations. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this method simply returns stored data without complex
    computations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the respawn time
    might be used for scheduling or timing purposes. If the game object has been destroyed
    or is not yet spawned, the returned value may not reflect actual respawn time
    but rather a calculated value based on server state.
