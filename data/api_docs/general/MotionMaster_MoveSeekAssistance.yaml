  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveSeekAssistance
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveSeekAssistance(float x, float y, float z)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a movement action for the unit to seek assistance from nearby allies.
  description: The MoveSeekAssistance method instructs a unit (typically an NPC or
    creature) to move toward a specified location while seeking help from nearby friendly
    units. This behavior is commonly used in World of Warcraft's AI system to simulate
    creatures calling for backup or moving toward a point where they expect support.
    The movement follows standard pathfinding mechanics, and the unit will attempt
    to navigate around obstacles. This method does not immediately teleport the unit
    but rather starts a movement sequence that continues until the destination is
    reached or interrupted.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the target location where the unit should seek
      assistance.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the target location where the unit should seek
      assistance.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the target location where the unit should seek
      assistance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to move a creature toward a specific point
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->GetMotionMaster()->MoveSeekAssistance(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic coordinates from a player's position
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      float x = player->GetPositionX();

      float y = player->GetPositionY();

      float z = player->GetPositionZ();

      creature->GetMotionMaster()->MoveSeekAssistance(x, y, z);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI scripts to simulate intelligent behavior
    where a creature moves toward a location while expecting or seeking support from
    nearby allies. The movement path will be calculated using the unit's current position
    and the provided coordinates, taking into account terrain and obstacles. It's
    important to note that this action does not interrupt other ongoing movements
    unless explicitly handled by the AI system.
  warnings: Ensure that the target coordinates are valid and within the game world
    boundaries to avoid unexpected behavior or movement errors. Calling this method
    without proper AI setup may result in the unit moving to an invalid location or
    failing to trigger any assistance-seeking behavior.
