  signature: void Player::SetHasLevelBoosted()
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's level boost status to indicate they have been level boosted.
  description: This method marks a player as having received a level boost, which
    typically occurs when a player's level is increased beyond their current maximum
    level through game mechanics such as level boosting or experience gain. The method
    updates internal state flags that track whether the player has undergone level
    boosting, allowing the game to properly handle level-related events and rewards.
    This is particularly relevant for players who have been boosted to higher levels
    than their original starting level, such as those who have received level 60 or
    higher boosts in World of Warcraft.

    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetHasLevelBoosted();

      // Player now marked as level boosted'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal player state flags that are used by the
    game engine to track level boost status. It should be called when a player's level
    is increased beyond their normal maximum level, such as through experience gain
    or level boosting mechanics.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a player has actually been boosted
    to a higher level than their current maximum level. Calling it without proper
    level boosting may cause incorrect game state tracking and lead to issues with
    level-related rewards or events.
