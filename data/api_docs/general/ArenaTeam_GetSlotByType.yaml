  class: ArenaTeam
  method: GetSlotByType
  signature: uint8 ArenaTeam::GetSlotByType(uint32 type)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the slot index corresponding to the specified arena team type.
  description: The GetSlotByType method retrieves the internal slot index associated
    with a given arena team type. In World of Warcraft's arena system, different arena
    formats (2v2, 3v3, 5v5) are represented by distinct types, and each type maps
    to a specific slot within the player's arena team roster. This method is typically
    used internally by the game engine to determine where a particular arena team
    type should be stored or accessed within the player's data structures. The method
    does not perform any validation on the input type, so callers should ensure that
    the provided type corresponds to a valid arena team format.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the slot index for the specified arena
    team type. The slot index is typically used as an array index to access the corresponding
    arena team data in internal arrays or containers. Valid return values are usually
    between 0 and 2, corresponding to the three standard arena team types (2v2, 3v3,
    5v5).
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve slot for 3v3 arena team
    code: uint8 slot = arenaTeam->GetSlotByType(ARENA_TEAM_3v3);
    language: cpp
  - title: Use slot to access arena team data
    code: "uint8 slot = player->GetArenaTeamSlotByType(ARENA_TEAM_5v5);\nif (slot\
      \ < MAX_ARENA_SLOT)\n{\n    ArenaTeam* team = player->GetArenaTeamBySlot(slot);\n\
      \    // Process team data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal arena team management system and is primarily
    used by TrinityCore's core systems. The mapping between types and slots is hardcoded
    within the engine, so modifications to this relationship would require changes
    to the source code. The method assumes valid input types and does not perform
    bounds checking.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unsupported arena team type may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect slot indices. Always validate that the
    provided type corresponds to a known arena format before calling this method.
