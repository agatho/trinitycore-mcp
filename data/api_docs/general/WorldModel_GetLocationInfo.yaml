  class: WorldModel
  method: GetLocationInfo
  signature: bool WorldModel::GetLocationInfo(const int & p, const int & down, float
    & dist, GroupLocationInfo & info) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves location information for a given point in the world model, including
    distance and group data.
  description: The GetLocationInfo method is used to query detailed information about
    a specific location within a WorldModel. It takes two integer parameters representing
    coordinates and returns whether the operation was successful. The method populates
    a float reference with the distance from the queried point to the nearest surface,
    and fills a GroupLocationInfo structure with group-related data for that location.
    This functionality is essential for terrain interaction, collision detection,
    and spatial queries in the game world. The method operates on a const object,
    meaning it does not modify the WorldModel's state during execution.
  parameters:
  - name: p
    description: An integer representing one of the coordinate values (likely X or
      Z axis) for the point being queried in the world model.
  - name: down
    description: An integer representing the second coordinate value (likely Y axis
      or depth) for the point being queried in the world model.
  - name: dist
    description: A reference to a float that will be populated with the calculated
      distance from the query point to the nearest surface in the world model.
  - name: info
    description: A reference to a GroupLocationInfo structure that will be filled
      with group-related data for the queried location.
  returns: Returns true if the location information was successfully retrieved and
    populated, false otherwise. This typically indicates whether the point exists
    within the model's bounds and valid data could be obtained.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int x = 1000;\nint y = 500;\nfloat distance;\nGroupLocationInfo locationInfo;\n\
      \nif (worldModel->GetLocationInfo(x, y, distance, locationInfo)) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Distance: \" << distance << \"\\n\";\n    // Process locationInfo\n}\
      \ else {\n    std::cout << \"Failed to retrieve location info\\n\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the game engine for collision detection,
    pathfinding, and terrain interaction. The parameters p and down may represent
    coordinates in a specific coordinate system used by TrinityCore's world model
    implementation. Since this is a const method, it should be thread-safe if used
    correctly.
  warnings: Ensure that the input coordinates are within valid ranges for the WorldModel
    to avoid undefined behavior. The GroupLocationInfo structure must be properly
    initialized before calling this method to prevent memory corruption or incorrect
    data.
