  class: MailSender
  method: GetMailMessageType
  signature: MailMessageType MailSender::GetMailMessageType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the mail message type associated with this mail sender instance.
  description: The GetMailMessageType method returns the MailMessageType enumeration
    value that represents the type of mail being sent or processed by this MailSender
    object. This enumeration typically defines different categories of mail such as
    normal mail, auction mail, creature mail, etc., which affects how the mail is
    handled within the game system. The returned value can be used to determine appropriate
    behavior for processing or displaying the mail message.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A MailMessageType enumeration value indicating the type of mail this sender
    represents. Possible values include but are not limited to: MAIL_NORMAL, MAIL_AUCTION,
    MAIL_CREATURE, MAIL_GAMEOBJECT, MAIL_ITEM, etc., depending on how the mail was
    initiated or processed.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MailSender sender;\nMailMessageType type = sender.GetMailMessageType();\n\
      if (type == MAIL_NORMAL)\n{\n    // Handle normal mail\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Mail Type
    code: "MailSender* sender = GetMailSender();\nMailMessageType type = sender->GetMailMessageType();\n\
      switch (type)\n{\n    case MAIL_NORMAL:\n        // Process normal mail\n  \
      \      break;\n    case MAIL_AUCTION:\n        // Handle auction-related mail\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Default handling for other types\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with mail processing systems
    to determine appropriate handling logic. The MailMessageType enumeration values
    are defined within the TrinityCore mail system and may vary based on game updates
    or custom modifications.
