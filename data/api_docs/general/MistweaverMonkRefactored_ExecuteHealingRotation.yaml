  class: MistweaverMonkRefactored
  method: ExecuteHealingRotation
  signature: void MistweaverMonkRefactored::ExecuteHealingRotation(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Mistweaver Monk's healing rotation logic for the specified group.
  description: The ExecuteHealingRotation method implements the core healing behavior
    for a Mistweaver Monk class in TrinityCore. It determines and applies the appropriate
    healing spells, abilities, and cooldown management based on the current combat
    state, target health percentages, and group composition. This method integrates
    with the AI system to make real-time decisions about when and how to heal allies
    within the specified group. The implementation considers factors such as mana
    efficiency, spell priorities, and raid coordination mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group of targets to heal. Valid
      values are typically 0-4 representing different group members or raid subgroups.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for healing group 1
    code: 'MistweaverMonkRefactored monk;

      monk.ExecuteHealingRotation(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing rotation for raid-wide healing
    code: "MistweaverMonkRefactored monk;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    monk.ExecuteHealingRotation(i);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked directly during combat without proper state checks. The implementation
    assumes that the Monk's target and group members are properly initialized and
    accessible through the AI context.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid AI context may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all group members are valid targets before execution
    to prevent errors.
