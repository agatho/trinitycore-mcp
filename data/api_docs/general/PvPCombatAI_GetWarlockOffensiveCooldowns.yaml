  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: GetWarlockOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetWarlockOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of offensive warlock cooldowns currently active on the
    player.
  description: The GetWarlockOffensiveCooldowns method is used within the PvPCombatAI
    class to determine how many offensive warlock abilities are currently on cooldown
    for a given player. This information is crucial for AI decision-making in PvP
    scenarios, particularly when determining optimal spell usage and timing. The method
    takes an integer pointer as input which likely represents the player's data structure
    or identifier, and returns an integer count of active offensive cooldowns. It
    is typically used during combat analysis to evaluate the warlock's offensive capability
    at any given moment.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's data structure or
      identifier. This parameter is expected to contain valid player context information
      for retrieving cooldown data.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the number of offensive warlock cooldowns
    currently active on the specified player. A return value of 0 indicates no offensive
    cooldowns are active, while higher values indicate increasing numbers of cooldowns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP Combat AI
    code: "int cooldownCount = pvpCombatAI->GetWarlockOffensiveCooldowns(&playerId);\n\
      if (cooldownCount == 0) {\n    // All offensive warlock abilities are available\n\
      \    // Proceed with offensive action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Cooldown Count for AI Decision Making
    code: "int* playerPtr = &playerId;\nint cooldowns = pvpCombatAI->GetWarlockOffensiveCooldowns(playerPtr);\n\
      if (cooldowns < 3) {\n    // Warlock has less than 3 offensive cooldowns\n \
      \   // Consider using a high-damage ability\n    aiContext->UseSpell(SPELL_SEED_OF_DEATH);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI system which is designed to provide
    intelligent combat behavior for warlock NPCs in player-versus-player scenarios.
    The implementation likely accesses internal cooldown tracking mechanisms within
    the TrinityCore framework. Developers should ensure that the player parameter
    points to a valid player object before calling this method.
  warnings: This method may return unexpected results if the player pointer is invalid
    or does not point to a warlock class character. Ensure proper validation of the
    player context before invoking this method in performance-critical code paths.
