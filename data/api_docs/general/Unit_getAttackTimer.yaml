  method: getAttackTimer
  signature: uint32 Unit::getAttackTimer(int type) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current attack timer value for the specified attack type.
  description: The getAttackTimer method retrieves the remaining time in milliseconds
    until the next attack can be performed for a specific attack type. This method
    is commonly used in combat mechanics to determine when a unit can perform its
    next melee attack, either primary or secondary. The returned value represents
    the time left before the next attack becomes available, which is crucial for managing
    attack speed and timing in World of Warcraft combat systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the milliseconds remaining until the next attack can be performed.
    Zero indicates that the attack is ready to be executed immediately. Values greater
    than zero indicate the time remaining before the next attack becomes available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nuint32 timer = target->getAttackTimer(ATTACK_MAIN);\
      \ // Returns time until next main hand attack\nif (timer == 0)\n{\n    // Attack\
      \ is ready to perform\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    like GetAttackSpeed and GetWeaponAttackTime. The value returned represents the
    actual time remaining, not the base attack speed. Performance considerations include
    checking this value frequently during combat to maintain accurate timing.
  warnings: The method may return zero values when an attack is ready to be performed,
    which can lead to incorrect assumptions if not properly handled in code. This
    method should be used carefully in combat situations as it's directly tied to
    game mechanics and can affect timing of attacks.
