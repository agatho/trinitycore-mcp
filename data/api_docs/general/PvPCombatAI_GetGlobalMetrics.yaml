api:
  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: GetGlobalMetrics
  signature: const PvPMetrics & PvPCombatAI::GetGlobalMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the global PvP metrics instance for the AI.
  description: The GetGlobalMetrics method returns a constant reference to the PvPMetrics
    object that contains aggregated PvP statistics and performance data for the AI.
    This metrics object typically includes information such as kill counts, death
    counts, honorable kills, dishonorable kills, and other relevant PvP-related data.
    The returned reference is guaranteed to be valid throughout the lifetime of the
    AI instance, making it safe to use without copying or managing memory manually.
    This method allows external systems or other AI components to access global PvP
    statistics for analysis, reporting, or gameplay balancing purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the PvPMetrics object containing global PvP statistics
    and performance data for this AI instance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Global PvP Metrics
    code: 'const PvPMetrics& metrics = ai->GetGlobalMetrics();

      uint32 kills = metrics.GetKills();

      uint32 deaths = metrics.GetDeaths();

      printf("Kills: %u, Deaths: %u\n", kills, deaths);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PvPMetrics reference should not be modified directly as it represents
    global state. Modifications to the metrics should be done through appropriate
    setter methods or internal AI logic. This method is thread-safe if the underlying
    PvPMetrics object is properly synchronized.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI instance is properly initialized before calling this
    method, as accessing metrics from an uninitialized AI may result in undefined
    behavior. The returned reference becomes invalid if the AI instance is destroyed.
