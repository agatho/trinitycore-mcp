  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: ExecuteAsync
  signature: void BotDatabasePool::ExecuteAsync(int * stmt, int callback, uint32 timeoutMs)
documentation:
  brief: Submits an asynchronous database statement for execution within the bot database
    pool.
  description: The ExecuteAsync method schedules a database statement to be executed
    asynchronously using the BotDatabasePool's internal thread pool. This allows database
    operations to occur without blocking the main game loop, improving performance
    and responsiveness. The method takes a prepared statement identifier, a callback
    function index, and an optional timeout value. It is designed for use in bot systems
    where non-blocking database access is essential for maintaining smooth AI behavior
    and avoiding lag.
  parameters:
  - name: stmt
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the prepared database statement
      identifier to be executed asynchronously.
  - name: callback
    description: Integer index identifying the callback function to be invoked upon
      completion of the database operation.
  - name: timeoutMs
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer specifying the maximum time (in milliseconds)
      to wait for the operation to complete before timing out.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic asynchronous database execution
    code: 'int statementId = botDB->PrepareStatement(SQL_INIT, "SELECT * FROM bot_data
      WHERE id = ?");

      botDB->ExecuteAsync(&statementId, 1, 5000);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within a thread pool and should not be used for operations
    requiring immediate results. The callback mechanism allows for handling completion
    events without blocking the calling thread. Ensure that the statement identifier
    is properly prepared before calling this function.
  warnings: Improper use of statement identifiers or callback indices may lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate parameters before execution, especially
    when dealing with external data sources.
