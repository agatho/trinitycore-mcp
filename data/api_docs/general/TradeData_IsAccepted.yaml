  method: IsAccepted
  signature: bool TradeData::IsAccepted() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the trade has been accepted by both parties.
  description: The IsAccepted method determines if both players in a trade session
    have confirmed their agreement to the trade. This method is typically used during
    the trading process to verify that neither party has cancelled the trade and that
    both parties have clicked the 'accept' button. The method returns true only when
    both traders have accepted the trade, indicating it can proceed to completion.
    This check is essential for maintaining proper game state and preventing invalid
    trades from being finalized.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if both players in the trade have accepted the trade, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that one or both parties
    have not yet accepted or have cancelled the trade.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Trade Acceptance Before Finalizing
    code: "if (tradeData->IsAccepted()) {\n    // Proceed with completing the trade\n\
      \    tradeData->CompleteTrade();\n} else {\n    // Notify players that trade\
      \ is not yet accepted\n    player1->SendNotification(\"Trade not yet accepted\
      \ by both parties.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the trade session. It's
    important to note that this check should be performed frequently during the trading
    process to ensure proper synchronization between client and server states. The
    method does not perform any side effects or modify the trade state directly.
  warnings: Do not assume that a trade is valid just because IsAccepted() returns
    true. Always validate other trade conditions such as item availability, inventory
    space, and player proximity before finalizing any trade operations.
