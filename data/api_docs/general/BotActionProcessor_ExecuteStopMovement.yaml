  class: BotActionProcessor

  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteStopMovement(Player * bot,
    const BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Stops the movement of a bot player and returns the result of the action execution.
  description: The ExecuteStopMovement method is responsible for halting the movement
    of a specified bot player within the TrinityCore framework. It interrupts any
    ongoing movement commands or pathfinding for the given player, effectively stopping
    their character from moving. This method is typically invoked as part of a bot's
    action processing pipeline when a stop movement command needs to be executed.
    The method ensures that the bot's movement state is properly updated and returns
    a BotActionResult indicating success or failure of the operation. It operates
    within the context of the World of Warcraft AI system, specifically designed for
    automated player behavior in bot systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotActionResult object that indicates whether the stop movement action
    was successfully executed or if an error occurred. The result typically contains
    information about the success status and any relevant error codes or messages.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteStopMovement
    code: "BotActionProcessor processor;\nPlayer* bot = ...; // Get reference to a\
      \ bot player\nBotAction action = BotAction::StopMovement();\nBotActionResult\
      \ result = processor.ExecuteStopMovement(bot, action);\nif (result.success)\n\
      {\n    // Movement stopped successfully\n    printf(\"Bot movement stopped successfully\\\
      n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed to stop bot\
      \ movement: %s\\n\", result.error_message.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player is valid and currently in a state
    where movement can be interrupted. The implementation likely interacts with the
    underlying movement system to cancel any active movement states or pathfinding
    tasks for the player. Performance-wise, this operation should be relatively lightweight
    as it primarily involves updating internal state rather than complex calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, otherwise the behavior may result in undefined behavior or crashes. This
    method should only be called on bot players, not on real player characters, as
    it's specifically designed for automated AI-controlled entities.
