documentation:
  brief: Sets the bidder ID for a black market item entry
  description: The SetBidder method assigns a bidder identifier to a BlackMarketEntry
    object, typically representing the player who placed the bid. This method is used
    within the context of World of Warcraft's black market system where players can
    bid on items. The bidder ID usually corresponds to a player's unique identifier
    (GUID) within the game world. This setter method updates the internal state of
    the black market entry to reflect the current highest bidder.
  parameters:
  - name: bidder
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who placed the bid on
      this black market item
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a bidder for a black market entry
    code: 'BlackMarketEntry entry;

      entry.SetBidder(12345);

      // The black market entry now has bidder ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating bidder when a new bid is placed
    code: "uint64 newBidder = player->GetGUID();\nBlackMarketEntry* entry = sBlackMarketMgr->GetBlackMarketEntry(entryId);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    entry->SetBidder(newBidder);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the BlackMarketEntry
    object. It should only be called when a valid bid is placed on the item. The bidder
    ID parameter is expected to be a valid player GUID from the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the bidder parameter represents a valid player GUID before
    calling this method, as invalid GUIDs may cause unexpected behavior in the black
    market system. This method does not validate whether the bidder actually has sufficient
    funds or meets other requirements for placing the bid.
