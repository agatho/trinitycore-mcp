documentation:
  brief: Sends CUF (Compact Unit Frames) profile data to the client for player's unit
    frames configuration.
  description: The SendLoadCUFProfiles method is responsible for transmitting Compact
    Unit Frames (CUF) profile settings from the server to the connected World of Warcraft
    client. This functionality allows players to have their custom unit frame configurations,
    such as health bar positions, name display options, and other visual preferences,
    loaded and applied when they log in or switch zones. The method typically sends
    a packet containing all relevant CUF profile data that the client uses to reconstruct
    the player's preferred unit frame layout. This ensures that players maintain their
    customized UI experience across different sessions and game events.

    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    // Load player data\n\
      \    session->SendLoadCUFProfiles();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the login process or when a player
    enters a new zone where custom frame configurations might be needed. The actual
    CUF profile data is usually pre-loaded in the session object or retrieved from
    the database before this call.
