  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void VengeanceDemonHunter::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldowns for Vengeance Demon Hunter abilities based on the elapsed
    game time.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers of various abilities specific to the Vengeance Demon Hunter
    class. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and processes
    the time difference (diff) to determine which abilities have come off cooldown
    and can be used again. It ensures that player actions respect the game's cooldown
    mechanics, preventing immediate re-use of powerful abilities. The method operates
    on internal cooldown tracking data structures and modifies them based on the passed
    time delta.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value is used to decrement cooldown timers and determine when abilities become
      available again.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateCooldowns Usage
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunter::Update()\n{\n    // Called every AI tick with\
      \ time difference\n    UpdateCooldowns(sWorld->GetGameTimeMS() - _lastUpdateTime);\n\
      \    _lastUpdateTime = sWorld->GetGameTimeMS();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunter::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Update cooldowns based on time passed\n    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \n    // Proceed with normal AI logic\n    DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Vengeance Demon Hunter's AI behavior and should
    be called regularly within the creature's update loop. The implementation assumes
    that diff represents a valid time interval in milliseconds, typically obtained
    from the game's main update cycle.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called with invalid or negative time values
    as it could lead to incorrect cooldown calculations. Also, make sure this method
    is invoked within the correct AI context to avoid unexpected behavior.
