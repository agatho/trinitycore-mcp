  class: BeastMasteryHunter
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool BeastMasteryHunter::CanUseAbility(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a Beast Mastery Hunter can use a specified ability.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a Beast Mastery Hunter character
    is eligible to use a given spell or ability. This check typically considers factors
    such as the hunter's current state, resource levels (like Focus or Energy), cooldowns,
    and any applicable game mechanics or restrictions that may prevent the use of
    the specified ability. It is commonly used in AI decision-making processes for
    pet behavior and player action validation within the context of the Beast Mastery
    specialization.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability to be checked for usability.
      This value corresponds to the Spell ID defined in the game's database.
  returns: Returns true if the Beast Mastery Hunter can use the specified ability,
    false otherwise. The method may return false due to cooldowns, insufficient resources,
    invalid target state, or other gameplay restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (hunter->CanUseAbility(12345)) {\n    // Execute the ability\n    hunter->CastSpell(target,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "void BeastMasteryAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (CanUseAbility(12345) && !me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\
      \ {\n        DoCastVictim(12345);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other hunter-specific checks
    such as pet state, target validity, and resource management. It does not perform
    the actual casting of the spell; it only determines eligibility.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId provided corresponds to a valid ability for Beast
    Mastery Hunters. Incorrect spell IDs may lead to unexpected behavior or logic
    errors in AI decision-making.
