documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player member leaves a group in the bot AI system
  description: The MemberLeftHandler method is responsible for processing the removal
    of a player from a group within the TrinityCore bot AI framework. This handler
    typically executes cleanup operations, updates internal group state tracking,
    and may trigger reorganization logic to maintain optimal group composition. The
    method ensures that the bot's AI behavior adapts appropriately when group dynamics
    change, such as recalculating roles or redistributing responsibilities among remaining
    members. It is invoked automatically by the AI system when a group member departs,
    either through leaving, disbanding, or being removed from the group.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Context
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnMemberLeft()\n{\n    MemberLeftHandler handler;\n    handler.MemberLeftHandler(this);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal bot AI event handling system and should
    not be called directly unless implementing custom group management logic. The
    handler assumes that the BotAI object has valid group state information and may
    rely on other internal systems for proper cleanup.
  warnings: Improper handling of this event can lead to inconsistent group state or
    unexpected behavior in bot AI decision-making. Ensure all group-related data structures
    are properly synchronized before invoking this method.
