  class: BotThreatManager
  method: CalculateRoleModifier
  signature: float BotThreatManager::CalculateRoleModifier() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the threat modifier value based on bot role configuration.
  description: The CalculateRoleModifier method computes a float value that represents
    how much threat a bot should generate or receive based on its assigned role within
    the group. This modifier is used in threat calculations to ensure bots behave
    appropriately according to their designated roles such as tank, healer, or damage
    dealer. The method accesses internal bot configuration data and applies role-specific
    multipliers or adjustments to determine the final modifier value. It does not
    modify any state and is purely a calculation function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated threat modifier for the bot's
    current role. Positive values typically indicate increased threat generation,
    while negative values may reduce threat. The exact meaning of the returned value
    depends on how it's used within the broader threat system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float modifier = botThreatManager.CalculateRoleModifier();

      // Use the modifier in threat calculations

      float finalThreat = baseThreat * modifier;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's current role configuration and internal state.
    It is typically called during threat update cycles or when recalculating threat
    values for a specific bot. The result may vary depending on the bot's class, specialization,
    and assigned role within the group.
