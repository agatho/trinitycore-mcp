  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: SelectOptimalReward
  signature: uint32 QuestTurnIn::SelectOptimalReward(const int & rewards, Player *
    bot, RewardSelectionStrategy strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the optimal quest reward based on the provided strategy and bot's
    inventory.
  description: The SelectOptimalReward method determines the most beneficial reward
    for a player bot when turning in a quest. It evaluates available rewards using
    a specified selection strategy, considering factors such as item value, inventory
    space, and quest requirements. This method is typically used by AI systems to
    automate quest completion decisions. The method requires a valid player reference
    and a defined reward selection strategy to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: rewards
    description: An integer representing the available rewards for the quest. This
      value likely corresponds to a bitmask or index of possible rewards.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will receive
      the reward. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: strategy
    description: The RewardSelectionStrategy enum value that defines how the optimal
      reward should be chosen. This may include strategies like highest value, most
      useful item, or based on inventory capacity.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the selected reward ID. If no valid reward
    can be selected, it may return 0 or an error code depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 rewardId = questTurnIn.SelectOptimalReward(7, botPlayer, RewardSelectionStrategy::HighestValue);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Inventory Check
    code: "if (botPlayer->GetFreeInventorySlots() > 0) {\n    uint32 rewardId = questTurnIn.SelectOptimalReward(15,\
      \ botPlayer, RewardSelectionStrategy::MostUseful);\n    // Process reward selection\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest data structures and may
    cache reward selections for performance. It assumes that the player object has
    valid inventory state information.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method, as dereferencing
    an invalid pointer will cause undefined behavior. The rewards parameter must be
    a valid identifier for available quest rewards.
