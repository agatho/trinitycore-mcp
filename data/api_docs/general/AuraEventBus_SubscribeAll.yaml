  class: AuraEventBus
  method: SubscribeAll
  signature: bool AuraEventBus::SubscribeAll(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all available aura events in the AuraEventBus.
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a given BotAI subscriber to receive
    notifications for all aura-related events managed by the AuraEventBus. This allows
    the AI to react to various aura states such as application, removal, or modification
    of auras on units within the game world. The method typically returns true if
    the subscription was successful and false if it failed due to invalid input or
    internal errors. It's commonly used during initialization of AI behavior modules
    that need comprehensive aura event handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotAI subscriber was successfully registered for all
    aura events; otherwise, returns false if registration fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Subscription Example
    code: "BotAI* myAI = new BotAI();\nbool success = AuraEventBus::instance()->SubscribeAll(myAI);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // AI is now subscribed to all aura events\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during the initialization phase of a BotAI instance.
    It's recommended to check the return value for error handling purposes, as subscription
    failures may indicate issues with the event bus or invalid subscriber references.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times with the same BotAI instance may lead
    to duplicate subscriptions or unexpected behavior. Ensure that each BotAI is subscribed
    only once unless explicitly designed for multiple subscriptions.
