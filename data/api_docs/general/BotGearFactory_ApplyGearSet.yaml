  class: BotGearFactory
  method: ApplyGearSet
  signature: bool BotGearFactory::ApplyGearSet(int * player, const GearSet & gearSet)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a specified gear set to a player character, updating their inventory
    with the configured items.
  description: The ApplyGearSet method is responsible for equipping a predefined set
    of gear onto a player character within the TrinityCore framework. This function
    takes a pointer to a player object and a GearSet structure containing item configurations,
    then processes the application of these items to the player's inventory. The method
    ensures that all items in the gear set are properly equipped or added to the player's
    inventory, handling any necessary validation or error conditions. It is typically
    used in bot systems or automated character management scenarios where specific
    gear configurations need to be rapidly applied to players.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose inventory will be modified with
      the gear set. Must not be null and should point to a valid Player instance.
  - name: gearSet
    description: Reference to a GearSet structure containing the configuration of
      items to be applied. This includes item IDs, enchantments, gems, and other equipment
      properties.
  returns: Returns true if the gear set was successfully applied to the player, false
    otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid item configurations, insufficient
    inventory space, or player state issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gear Set Application
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nGearSet gearSet;\n// Configure\
      \ gearSet with items\nbool success = BotGearFactory::ApplyGearSet(&player, gearSet);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Gear set applied successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Gear Set Application with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nGearSet gearSet;\ngearSet.items.push_back({12345,\
      \ 0, 0}); // Add item ID 12345\nbool result = BotGearFactory::ApplyGearSet(&player,\
      \ gearSet);\nif (!result) {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to apply gear set to\
      \ player %u\", player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GearSet structure is properly initialized and
    contains valid item configurations. The player object must be in a valid state
    for equipment changes. Performance may be impacted if large gear sets are applied
    frequently or if inventory validation is extensive.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent segmentation faults. Also, verify that the GearSet items are compatible
    with the player's level and class to avoid invalid equipment states.
