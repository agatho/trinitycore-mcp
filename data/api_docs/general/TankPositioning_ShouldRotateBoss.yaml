  class: TankPositioning
  method: ShouldRotateBoss
  signature: bool TankPositioning::ShouldRotateBoss(Unit * target, float currentFacing,
    float desiredFacing)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the boss should rotate to face a target based on current
    and desired facing angles.
  description: The ShouldRotateBoss method evaluates if a boss unit needs to perform
    a rotation to align its facing direction with a specified target. This is typically
    used in AI behavior for managing boss positioning during combat encounters. The
    method compares the current facing angle of the boss with the desired facing angle
    toward the target, and returns true if a rotation is necessary. It considers factors
    such as rotation speed, angular difference, and potential combat mechanics that
    might prevent immediate rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target the boss should
      face. Must be a valid unit in the game world.
  - name: currentFacing
    description: The current facing angle of the boss in radians. Should be a value
      between 0 and 2*PI.
  - name: desiredFacing
    description: The desired facing angle toward the target in radians. Should be
      a value between 0 and 2*PI.
  returns: Returns true if the boss should rotate to face the target, false otherwise.
    The decision is based on angular difference and rotation mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (tankPositioning->ShouldRotateBoss(target, currentFacing, desiredFacing))\
      \ {\n    boss->SetFacingTo(desiredFacing);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state checks
    code: "if (boss->GetVictim() && ShouldRotateBoss(boss->GetVictim(), boss->GetOrientation(),\
      \ desiredAngle)) {\n    boss->SetFacingTo(desiredAngle);\n    boss->SendMovementFlagUpdate();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in boss AI scripts to manage positioning and
    facing during combat. It's important to note that the actual rotation may be constrained
    by movement flags or combat states. The facing angles are expected to be normalized
    between 0 and 2*PI radians.
  warnings: Ensure that target is not null before calling this method, as passing
    a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be aware that frequent
    calls to this method without proper cooldowns may cause performance issues in
    high-frequency AI updates.
