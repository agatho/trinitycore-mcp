documentation:
  brief: Handles player movement when they fall under the map boundaries in a battleground.
  description: The HandlePlayerUnderMap method is responsible for managing player
    behavior when their character falls below the playable area of a battleground.
    This typically occurs when a player falls through the world map or into an unreachable
    area. The method checks if the player's position is outside valid battleground
    boundaries and takes appropriate action, such as teleporting them back to a safe
    location or marking them as inactive. It plays a crucial role in maintaining game
    integrity by preventing players from exploiting map boundaries to gain unfair
    advantages or become stuck in invalid positions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully handled and moved back to a
    valid position, or false if the operation failed or no action was needed. The
    method may return false if the player is already in a valid location or if the
    battleground state prevents handling.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground update loop
    code: "void Battleground::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\
      \ ...\n    for (auto& player : m_players)\n    {\n        if (player && !player->IsAlive())\n\
      \            continue;\n        \n        if (!HandlePlayerUnderMap(player))\n\
      \        {\n            // Handle case where player couldn't be moved\n    \
      \        sLog->outError(\"Failed to handle under-map player in battleground\
      \ %u\", GetInstanceId());\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground update cycles and should
    not be invoked directly by other systems without proper context. The implementation
    likely involves checking player coordinates against predefined boundary values
    and performing teleportation or position correction. It's important to note that
    this method may have performance implications if called frequently on many players
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to players becoming stuck in
    invalid positions, which may cause server instability or exploit opportunities.
    Developers should ensure proper synchronization when calling this method from
    different threads or contexts. The method might not handle all edge cases of player
    position validation, so additional checks may be required in custom battleground
    implementations.
