  class: Channel
  method: UnsetMute
  signature: void Channel::UnsetMute(const Player * player, const std::string & newname)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the muted status from a specified player in the channel.
  description: The UnsetMute method removes the mute status of a given player within
    a channel, allowing them to speak again. This function is typically used by channel
    moderators or administrators to revoke a previous mute action. The method takes
    a pointer to the player object and the name of the new player who will be unmuted.
    It ensures that the specified player is no longer silenced in the channel's context.
    This operation affects only the mute state and does not modify other channel properties
    such as membership or permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose mute status will be removed.
      Must not be null.
  - name: newname
    description: The string name of the player to be unmuted. This is used for identification
      and validation purposes within the channel.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unmute Usage
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player->GetTeam());\n\
      if (channel)\n{\n    channel->UnsetMute(player, \"NewPlayerName\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player is already muted in the channel and that
    the provided name matches the muted player's current name. It does not perform
    any checks for administrative rights or channel ownership.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this function to
    avoid undefined behavior. Also, verify that the newname parameter correctly identifies
    the muted player to prevent unintended unmutes.
