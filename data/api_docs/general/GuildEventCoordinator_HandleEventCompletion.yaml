documentation:
  brief: Completes a guild event by processing its final state and updating related
    systems
  description: The HandleEventCompletion method is responsible for finalizing a guild
    event identified by its unique event ID. This method typically processes the event's
    completion logic, updates player and guild data, handles rewards distribution,
    and ensures all associated systems are synchronized. The method likely performs
    cleanup operations, triggers post-event callbacks, and may update the guild's
    event log or status indicators. It serves as a central handler for concluding
    guild activities such as raids, quests, or other organized events within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event to be completed. This ID
      should correspond to an existing event in the guild's event system and typically
      maps to a specific event type such as raid completion, quest finish, or guild
      activity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Completing a Raid Event
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 raidEventId = 12345;

      coordinator.HandleEventCompletion(raidEventId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Multiple Events in Sequence
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\nstd::vector<uint32> eventIds = {1001,\
      \ 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32 id : eventIds) {\n    coordinator.HandleEventCompletion(id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to persist event completion
    data and may trigger additional system notifications. It should be called only
    for valid, active events to prevent undefined behavior. The method may perform
    asynchronous operations internally, so callers should ensure proper synchronization
    if required.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid eventId may result in undefined behavior
    or database corruption. Ensure that the event exists and is in a state suitable
    for completion before invoking this method.
