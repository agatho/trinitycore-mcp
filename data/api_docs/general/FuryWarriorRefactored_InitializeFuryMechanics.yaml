  class: FuryWarriorRefactored
  method: InitializeFuryMechanics
  signature: void FuryWarriorRefactored::InitializeFuryMechanics()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the fury mechanics and associated variables for a Fury Warrior
    class instance.
  description: The InitializeFuryMechanics method sets up all necessary internal state
    and configurations required for the Fury Warrior's combat abilities. This includes
    initializing fury resource tracking, setting base values for rage generation,
    configuring ability cooldowns, and preparing the warrior's attack and spell casting
    mechanics specific to the Fury specialization. The method ensures that all fury-related
    systems are properly initialized before the warrior enters combat or begins executing
    any fury-based actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'FuryWarriorRefactored furyWarrior;

      furyWarrior.InitializeFuryMechanics();

      // Warrior is now ready to use fury-based abilities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the warrior's initialization
    phase. It must be invoked before any combat-related actions are performed. The
    method does not perform any checks for existing initialized state, so calling
    it multiple times may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks.
  warnings: Do not call this method after combat has begun as it may interfere with
    active fury mechanics and cause unexpected behavior. Ensure all prerequisite systems
    (such as player object initialization) are complete before invoking this method.
