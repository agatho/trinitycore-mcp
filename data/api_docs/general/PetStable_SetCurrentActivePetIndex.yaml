  class: PetStable
  method: SetCurrentActivePetIndex
  signature: void PetStable::SetCurrentActivePetIndex(uint32 index)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the index of the currently active pet in the pet stable.
  description: The SetCurrentActivePetIndex method updates the index that identifies
    which pet is currently active within the player's pet stable. This method is typically
    used to manage the player's active pet selection, allowing them to switch between
    different summoned pets or companions. The index parameter should correspond to
    a valid pet slot within the stable's internal array structure. This method does
    not directly summon or dismiss pets; it only updates the reference to which pet
    is considered 'active'.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: The zero-based index of the pet in the stable to set as currently
      active. Valid values are typically between 0 and the maximum number of pets
      allowed in the stable minus one.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Active Pet to First Slot
    code: 'PetStable* stable = player->GetPetStable();

      stable->SetCurrentActivePetIndex(0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Switching Active Pet Based on Condition
    code: "PetStable* stable = player->GetPetStable();\nuint32 currentActiveIndex\
      \ = stable->GetCurrentActivePetIndex();\nif (currentActiveIndex < 5) {\n   \
      \ stable->SetCurrentActivePetIndex(currentActiveIndex + 1);\n} else {\n    stable->SetCurrentActivePetIndex(0);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called with valid indices that exist within the
    pet stable's bounds. Invalid indices may cause undefined behavior or internal
    errors. The actual pet summoning and management logic is handled separately by
    other methods in the PetStable class.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided index corresponds to an existing pet in the stable,
    otherwise the method may result in invalid state or crashes. This method does
    not validate whether the pet at the given index is actually summoned or available
    for use.
