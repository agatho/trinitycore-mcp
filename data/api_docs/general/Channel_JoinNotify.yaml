documentation:
  brief: Sends a join notification to all players in the channel when a player joins.
  description: The JoinNotify method is responsible for broadcasting a notification
    message to all members of a channel when a new player successfully joins. This
    method ensures that channel members are informed about the addition of a new participant,
    which is essential for maintaining communication awareness within the channel.
    The method typically handles the logic for sending appropriate chat messages or
    system notifications to existing channel members. It does not perform any validation
    on the player parameter itself, assuming it has already been verified as valid
    before calling this method.

  - title: Basic Usage in Channel Join Logic
    code: "void Player::JoinChannel(Channel* channel)\n{\n    if (channel)\n    {\n\
      \        channel->JoinNotify(this);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely internally uses the Channel's member list to iterate through
    all connected players and send individual notifications. It may involve sending
    a specific chat message type or system message to each player in the channel,
    which could impact performance if the channel has many members.
