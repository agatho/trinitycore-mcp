  class: QuestValidation
  method: GetValidationErrors
  signature: int QuestValidation::GetValidationErrors(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates a quest for a player and returns the number of validation errors
    found.
  description: The GetValidationErrors method performs a comprehensive validation
    check on a specified quest for a given player character. It examines various aspects
    of the quest such as prerequisites, requirements, availability, and compatibility
    with the player's current state. The method returns an integer representing the
    count of validation errors detected during this process. This is commonly used
    in quest management systems to ensure quests are properly configured and accessible
    to players before they attempt to accept or interact with them. The validation
    may include checks for level requirements, quest completion status, item possession,
    faction standing, and other game-specific conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate. Must be a valid quest
      ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character for whom
      the quest validation is performed. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the number of validation errors found.
    A return value of 0 means no errors were detected, while any positive integer
    indicates the count of validation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Valid player pointer\n\
      int errorCount = QuestValidation::GetValidationErrors(questId, player);\nif\
      \ (errorCount == 0)\n{\n    // Quest is valid for this player\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest acceptance or interaction\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle validation\
      \ errors\n    // Display appropriate error messages to the player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation Error Handling
    code: "void HandleQuestValidation(uint32 questId, Player* player)\n{\n    int\
      \ errors = QuestValidation::GetValidationErrors(questId, player);\n    switch\
      \ (errors)\n    {\n        case 0:\n            // Quest is fully valid\n  \
      \          break;\n        case 1:\n            // Single validation error -\
      \ inform player\n            player->SendNotification(\"Quest has one validation\
      \ issue.\");\n            break;\n        default:\n            // Multiple\
      \ validation errors - prevent quest interaction\n            player->SendNotification(\"\
      Quest cannot be accepted due to multiple issues.\");\n            break;\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups and complex conditional checks,
    so it may have performance implications when called frequently. The validation
    process might involve checking player's quest log, inventory, reputation, level,
    and other character state information. It is recommended to cache results when
    performing multiple validations for the same quest and player combination.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    The method assumes that the questId exists in the database and may not handle
    invalid quest IDs gracefully.
