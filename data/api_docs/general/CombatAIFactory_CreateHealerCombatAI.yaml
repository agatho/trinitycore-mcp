  signature: int CombatAIFactory::CreateHealerCombatAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new healer combat AI instance for a bot.
  description: The CreateHealerCombatAI method is responsible for instantiating a
    healer-type combat AI behavior for a specified bot within the TrinityCore framework.
    This function allocates memory for the AI, configures its initial settings, and
    assigns appropriate healing abilities and strategies based on the bot's class
    and level. The method integrates with the core AI system to ensure proper behavior
    execution during combat scenarios where healing is required. It typically returns
    an identifier or status code indicating success or failure of the AI creation
    process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the result of the AI creation operation.
    A positive value usually indicates successful creation, while a negative value
    may denote an error condition such as invalid parameters, insufficient memory,
    or unsupported bot class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint result = CombatAIFactory::CreateHealerCombatAI(&botId);\n\
      if (result >= 0) {\n    // AI created successfully\n    printf(\"Healer AI created\
      \ for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed\
      \ to create healer AI for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's automated bot system and requires
    proper initialization of the bot before calling. The returned integer may represent
    either a unique identifier for the newly created AI instance or an error code
    depending on implementation details. Developers should ensure that the bot parameter
    points to a valid, initialized bot object.
  warnings: The method assumes that the input parameter 'bot' is a valid pointer to
    a bot structure. Passing null or uninitialized pointers may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Additionally, this function might not be thread-safe and
    should be called from within a safe context.
