  method: RemoveItem
  signature: void Bag::RemoveItem(int slot, bool update)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an item from a specific slot in the bag, optionally updating the
    client.
  description: The RemoveItem method removes an item from a specified slot within
    a Bag object. It takes a slot index and a boolean flag indicating whether to update
    the client's view of the inventory. This method is typically used when items are
    consumed, dropped, or moved from one container to another. The slot parameter
    refers to the position within the bag's internal array, and the update flag determines
    if the player's client should be notified of the change. If the slot is invalid
    or empty, the method may silently fail or trigger an error depending on implementation
    details.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The index of the slot from which to remove the item. Must be a valid
      slot number within the bag's capacity.
  - name: update
    description: If true, sends an update packet to the player's client to reflect
      the change in inventory. If false, only removes the item internally without
      notifying the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Item and Update Client
    code: "Bag* bag = player->GetBag(0);\nif (bag)\n{\n    bag->RemoveItem(5, true);\
      \ // Remove item from slot 5 and update client\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Item Without Client Update
    code: "Bag* bag = player->GetBag(1);\nif (bag)\n{\n    bag->RemoveItem(3, false);\
      \ // Remove item from slot 3 without updating client\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the slot index beyond basic
    bounds checking. It is recommended to verify that the slot contains an item before
    calling this function to avoid unexpected behavior. The update flag should be
    set to false when performing batch operations or internal processing to prevent
    excessive network traffic.
  warnings: Calling RemoveItem with an invalid slot index may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always ensure the slot is valid and contains an item before
    removal. Using update = true in high-frequency scenarios can cause performance
    issues due to client updates.
