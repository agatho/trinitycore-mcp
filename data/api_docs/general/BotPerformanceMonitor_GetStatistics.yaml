  signature: MetricStatistics BotPerformanceMonitor::GetStatistics(MetricType type)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical metrics for a specified performance monitoring type.
  description: The GetStatistics method retrieves pre-calculated statistical data
    for a given metric type from the BotPerformanceMonitor. This method is used to
    access aggregated performance data such as average, minimum, maximum, and total
    values for various bot-related performance indicators. The statistics are typically
    updated periodically or upon specific events within the performance monitoring
    system. The method does not modify any internal state and is safe for concurrent
    access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A MetricStatistics object containing aggregated statistical data for the
    requested metric type, including average, minimum, maximum, total count, and other
    relevant performance metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve average bot response time statistics
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      MetricStatistics stats = monitor.GetStatistics(MetricType::BOT_RESPONSE_TIME);

      std::cout << "Average response time: " << stats.average << " ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that statistics have been previously calculated and stored
    for the requested metric type. If no data exists for the specified type, the returned
    structure will contain default or zero values. The method is designed to be lightweight
    and should not cause performance bottlenecks in high-frequency usage scenarios.
