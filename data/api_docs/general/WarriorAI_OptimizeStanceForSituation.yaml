  class: WarriorAI
  method: OptimizeStanceForSituation
  signature: void WarriorAI::OptimizeStanceForSituation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the warrior's combat stance based on the current target situation.
  description: The OptimizeStanceForSituation method evaluates the current combat
    scenario and dynamically switches the warrior AI's stance to optimize performance
    for the given target. This includes assessing factors such as target proximity,
    threat level, and available abilities to determine whether to use Battle Stance,
    Defensive Stance, or Berserker Stance. The method is typically called during combat
    updates to ensure the warrior maintains the most effective stance for dealing
    damage or surviving incoming attacks. It integrates with the AI's decision-making
    process and does not directly control stance changes but rather influences them
    based on situational awareness.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter is used to evaluate the threat level, distance, and other combat-relevant
      properties for stance optimization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI update
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n    OptimizeStanceForSituation(target);\n\
      \n    // Additional combat logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WarriorAI's internal decision-making system and
    should be called regularly during combat updates. The stance optimization is based
    on heuristics rather than precise calculations, so results may vary slightly depending
    on current game state and AI implementation details.
