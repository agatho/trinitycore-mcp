documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotMemoryManager instance and releases all associated memory
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotMemoryManager class is responsible for cleaning
    up all dynamically allocated memory and resources that were managed by this instance.
    It ensures proper deallocation of bot-related memory structures, preventing memory
    leaks within the TrinityCore environment. This method is automatically invoked
    when a BotMemoryManager object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The
    destructor typically handles cleanup of internal data structures such as memory
    pools, cached bot states, and any temporary allocations used during bot operation.
    It's crucial that this destructor is called to maintain stable performance and
    prevent resource exhaustion in long-running server environments.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotMemoryManager instance
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = new BotMemoryManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete memoryManager; // Triggers ~BotMemoryManager()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotMemoryManager localManager;\n    // ...\
      \ use localManager ...\n    // ~BotMemoryManager() called automatically when\
      \ function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. In most cases, the destructor is invoked automatically by the C++ runtime
    when objects go out of scope or are deleted. Memory allocated by this manager
    may include bot behavior trees, cached target information, and temporary action
    queues.
  warnings: Improper handling of BotMemoryManager destruction can lead to memory leaks
    in long-running server instances. Never call the destructor manually on stack-allocated
    objects as it will be called automatically. Ensure all references to managed resources
    are properly cleaned up before destruction.
