  signature: bool Creature::HasLootMode(uint16 lootMode) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the creature has a specific loot mode enabled.
  description: This method determines whether a creature's loot system is configured
    with a particular loot mode. It is used to verify the current loot mode settings
    for the creature, which affects how loot is distributed among players. The method
    returns true if the specified loot mode is active, false otherwise. This functionality
    is essential for managing loot distribution in World of Warcraft instances and
    raids where different loot modes (Normal, Heroic, LFR, etc.) may be used.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature has the specified loot mode enabled, false
    otherwise. The method does not return null or error values as it is a boolean
    check.
  examples:
  - title: Checking loot mode for a creature
    code: "if (creature->HasLootMode(1)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related methods
    to manage creature loot behavior. It's important to note that loot modes are usually
    defined by the game's internal system and may vary depending on instance difficulty
    or raid content.
  warnings: The method should be used carefully when checking for specific loot modes,
    as incorrect usage can lead to improper loot distribution. Ensure that the loot
    mode being checked is valid and corresponds to expected game mechanics.
