documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature should not search for assistance when being attacked.
  description: This method controls the creature's behavior regarding assistance searching,
    determining whether it will automatically seek help from nearby allies when taking
    damage. When set to true, the creature will not call for assistance even if it
    is under attack. This is particularly useful for boss creatures or NPCs that should
    remain focused on their current target without distractions. The setting affects
    the creature's AI behavior and can be used to control combat dynamics in World
    of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: If true, the creature will not search for assistance when attacked;
      if false, it will search for assistance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetNoSearchAssistance(true);

      // Creature will not call for assistance when attacked'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the creature's AI behavior and should be used
    carefully during creature creation or modification. It is typically used in conjunction
    with other AI-related methods to control NPC behavior in combat.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in creature
    combat, potentially causing creatures to become unresponsive or unable to engage
    properly with players. This setting should be applied only when specific AI behavior
    is desired.
