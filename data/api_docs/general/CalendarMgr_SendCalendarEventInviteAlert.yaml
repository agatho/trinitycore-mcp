documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar event invite alert to the invited player.
  description: The SendCalendarEventInviteAlert method is responsible for notifying
    a player that they have been invited to a calendar event. This method is typically
    invoked when an event is created or modified, and it ensures that the invited
    player receives an in-game notification about the event details. The alert includes
    information such as the event name, date, time, and any associated notes. This
    functionality is part of the World of Warcraft calendar system within TrinityCore,
    enabling players to stay informed about scheduled events and activities.
  parameters:
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: A constant reference to the CalendarEvent object that contains the
      event details being invited to.
  - name: invite
    description: A constant reference to the CalendarInvite object that holds information
      about the invite, including the invited player's GUID and invite status.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void SendCalendarEventInviteAlert(const CalendarEvent& calendarEvent, const\
      \ CalendarInvite& invite) const {\n    // Implementation would send a packet\
      \ to the invited player's client\n    // notifying them of the event invitation\n\
      }\n\n// Example usage:\nCalendarEvent event;\nCalendarInvite invite;\n// ...\
      \ populate event and invite data ...\ninstance->SendCalendarEventInviteAlert(event,\
      \ invite);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal calendar management system in TrinityCore.
    It likely sends a specific packet to the client to display the invite alert. The
    method should only be called when an event invite is actually being sent, not
    for every event modification.
