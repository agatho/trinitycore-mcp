  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleShieldBlockValue
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleShieldBlockValue(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes shield block value modifications from the aura application.
  description: The HandleShieldBlockValue method is responsible for managing the shield
    block value effect of an aura. When applied, it modifies the target's shield block
    value, typically increasing their ability to block incoming attacks. This method
    is invoked during aura application or removal and interacts with the AuraApplication
    object to determine how the shield block value should be adjusted. The method
    operates based on the mode parameter which indicates whether the effect is being
    applied or removed, and it uses the apply flag to control the direction of the
    modification.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This contains information about the aura's state and target.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation indicating how the effect should be handled.
      Typically represents the application state (e.g., 0 for apply, 1 for remove).
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the shield block value modification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shield Block Value Application
    code: "void ApplyShieldBlockAura(Unit* target, uint32 spellId)\n{\n    AuraApplication*\
      \ auraApp = target->GetAuraApplication(spellId);\n    if (auraApp)\n    {\n\
      \        AuraEffect* effect = auraApp->GetBase()->GetEffect(0);\n        if\
      \ (effect && effect->GetAuraType() == SPELL_AURA_MOD_SHIELD_BLOCK_VALUE)\n \
      \       {\n            effect->HandleShieldBlockValue(auraApp, 0, true);\n \
      \       }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system and should only be called
    from within the context of aura application or removal. The mode parameter typically
    corresponds to the aura's application state and must be correctly set for proper
    behavior. This method modifies the target's shield block value directly, affecting
    combat mechanics such as damage reduction.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect shield block calculations,
    potentially causing gameplay imbalance or unexpected behavior in combat. Ensure
    that aurApp is valid before calling this method and that the mode parameter accurately
    reflects the aura's current state.
