  signature: FormationType FormationUtils::GetOptimalFormationForTerrain(const int
    & location)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal battle formation type based on the specified terrain
    location.
  description: The GetOptimalFormationForTerrain method evaluates the given terrain
    location and returns the most suitable formation type for tactical effectiveness
    in that environment. This utility function is typically used by AI-controlled
    units or player characters to select an appropriate combat formation based on
    environmental factors such as terrain type, obstacles, or battlefield conditions.
    The method likely considers various attributes of the location, including elevation
    changes, visibility, and potential cover, to determine whether a tight formation
    (for close-quarters combat), spread formation (for ranged attacks), or another
    specialized formation would be most effective.
  parameters:
  - name: location
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific terrain location within
      the game world. This value typically corresponds to a unique map coordinate,
      zone ID, or terrain type index that determines the environmental conditions
      for combat.
  returns: Returns a FormationType enum value indicating the optimal formation strategy
    for the specified terrain. Possible values may include FORMATION_TIGHT, FORMATION_WIDE,
    FORMATION_COLUMN, or other formation types depending on the implementation and
    game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'FormationType optimalFormation = FormationUtils::GetOptimalFormationForTerrain(12345);

      // Use optimalFormation to set unit formation before combat'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Formation Selection
    code: 'int currentLocation = player->GetMap()->GetZoneId();

      FormationType selectedFormation = FormationUtils::GetOptimalFormationForTerrain(currentLocation);

      player->SetFormation(selectedFormation);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger tactical AI system that dynamically
    adjusts unit formations based on battlefield conditions. The exact logic for determining
    optimal formations may be influenced by factors such as unit types, available
    resources, and enemy positioning.
  warnings: Ensure that the location parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual
    terrain in the game world; invalid or out-of-bounds values could lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect formation selection.
