documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the unit has a specific spell focus.
  description: This method determines if a unit possesses a particular spell focus,
    which is typically related to specific spell effects or mechanics that require
    the unit to have certain focus types. The method evaluates the spell's focus requirements
    against the unit's current state and returns true if the focus condition is met.
    This functionality is commonly used in spell handling and game mechanics for determining
    whether a unit can cast or interact with spells that require specific focus conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has the specified spell focus, false otherwise.
    The method may return false if the spell focus does not exist or if the unit lacks
    the required focus type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->HasSpellFocus(spell)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely checks against the spell's focus type and may involve internal
    unit state evaluation. Performance impact is minimal as it only involves simple
    comparisons.
