  method: UpdateCombatCache
  signature: bool GroupCombatTrigger::UpdateCombatCache(Group * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat cache for a group, determining if any member is currently
    in combat.
  description: The UpdateCombatCache method evaluates the current combat status of
    all members within a specified group. It checks whether any player or creature
    in the group has engaged in combat and updates an internal cache accordingly.
    This functionality is crucial for group-based AI behaviors, loot distribution
    rules, and quest progression that depend on group combat activity. The method
    returns true if the cache was successfully updated, and false if no changes occurred
    or if the group is invalid.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat cache was successfully updated with new combat
    status information for the group members; returns false if no update was necessary
    or if the group parameter is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup && groupCombatTrigger->UpdateCombatCache(myGroup))\
      \ {\n    // Cache updated successfully\n    // Proceed with combat-dependent\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group updates or when combat state
    changes occur. It may be optimized to avoid redundant checks if the group's combat
    status hasn't changed since the last update.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
