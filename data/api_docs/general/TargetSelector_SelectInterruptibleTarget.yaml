  class: TargetSelector
  method: SelectInterruptibleTarget
  signature: Unit * TargetSelector::SelectInterruptibleTarget(float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the most interruptible target within a specified range for casting
    spells that can be interrupted.
  description: The SelectInterruptibleTarget method identifies and returns the Unit
    (player or creature) that is currently casting a spell which can be interrupted,
    located within the given maximum range. This function prioritizes targets based
    on their current casting state and interruptibility, making it useful for AI behavior
    where interrupting enemy casts is beneficial. It typically evaluates all units
    in the vicinity of the caster, checking if they are casting spells that support
    interruption such as channeled spells or cast times longer than a certain threshold.
    The method ensures that only valid, non-self targets within range are considered.
  parameters:
  - name: maxRange
    description: The maximum distance in yards within which to search for interruptible
      targets. Must be a positive value; negative or zero values will result in no
      targets being selected.
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object representing the most interruptible target
    within range, or nullptr if no suitable target is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "Unit* target = selector->SelectInterruptibleTarget(30.0f);\nif (target)\n\
      {\n    // Cast an interrupt spell on the selected target\n    caster->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_INTERRUPT_SPELL, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with conditional logic for better targeting
    code: "Unit* target = selector->SelectInterruptibleTarget(25.0f);\nif (target\
      \ && target->IsCasting())\n{\n    // Ensure the target is actively casting before\
      \ interrupting\n    if (target->GetSpellHistory()->HasCooldown(SPELL_INTERRUPTIBLE_SPELL))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    caster->CastSpell(target, SPELL_INTERRUPT_SPELL,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI logic and spell casting state tracking.
    It may not consider all possible interruptible spells unless explicitly supported
    by the core's spell system. Performance is optimized for typical use cases but
    can be affected when many units are in range.
  warnings: Do not assume that a returned target will always be castable or interruptible;
    always verify the target's current casting state before attempting to interrupt.
    Also, ensure maxRange is set appropriately to avoid unnecessary computation or
    targeting issues.
