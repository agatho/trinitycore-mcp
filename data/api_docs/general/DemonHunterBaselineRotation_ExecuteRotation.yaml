  class: DemonHunterBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool DemonHunterBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target,
    BaselineRotationManager & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Demon Hunter baseline rotation logic for a bot character.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method performs the core logic of the Demon Hunter
    class's baseline rotation behavior. It evaluates the current combat state, player
    resources, and target conditions to determine the appropriate ability to cast
    or execute next. This method integrates with the BaselineRotationManager to coordinate
    rotation decisions and ensures proper resource management according to Demon Hunter
    gameplay mechanics. The method returns true if a rotation action was successfully
    executed, or false if no valid action could be determined or performed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot character's data structure containing player state
      and attributes
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target character's data structure for combat evaluation
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager that handles rotation coordination
      and state tracking
  returns: True if a valid rotation action was executed successfully, false otherwise.
    Returns false when no suitable ability can be determined or when execution conditions
    are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rotation Execution
    code: "int botData = 0;\nint targetData = 0;\nBaselineRotationManager manager;\n\
      DemonHunterBaselineRotation rotation;\nbool result = rotation.ExecuteRotation(&botData,\
      \ &targetData, manager);\nif (result) {\n    // Rotation action was executed\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI() {\n    int bot = GetBotData();\n    int\
      \ target = GetTargetData();\n    BaselineRotationManager manager;\n    \n  \
      \  if (!rotation.ExecuteRotation(&bot, &target, manager)) {\n        // Handle\
      \ case where no rotation action was performed\n        MoveToTarget();\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called within the AI update loop of a Demon
    Hunter bot. It assumes that the bot and target data structures are properly initialized
    and contain valid information about player state, health, mana, and combat conditions.
    The method performs internal checks for resource availability and cooldowns before
    executing any rotation actions.
  warnings: The method may return false if the bot's current state does not meet requirements
    for rotation execution. Ensure that the bot data structures are properly synchronized
    with the game state to avoid incorrect rotation decisions. This method should
    not be called outside of a valid combat context without proper state validation.
