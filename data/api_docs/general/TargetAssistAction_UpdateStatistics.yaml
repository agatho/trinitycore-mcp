  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: UpdateStatistics
  signature: void TargetAssistAction::UpdateStatistics(bool assistedLeader, std::chrono::milliseconds
    switchTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates target assist statistics based on whether the leader was assisted
    and the time elapsed since last switch.
  description: The UpdateStatistics method is used in the TargetAssistAction class
    to maintain internal tracking of target assistance behavior. It records whether
    the current target assist action resulted in assisting the leader and tracks the
    time elapsed since the last target switch. This functionality is typically used
    within AI decision-making processes for group-based actions, particularly in scenarios
    where maintaining proper targeting order or cooldowns between target switches
    is important. The method updates internal state variables that may be used by
    other methods in the class to determine next action logic.
  parameters:
  - name: assistedLeader
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the leader was successfully assisted
      during this action cycle. True if assistance occurred, false otherwise.
  - name: switchTime
    description: The time duration (in milliseconds) since the last target switch
      occurred. Used to track cooldown periods and timing between actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'TargetAssistAction action;

      action.UpdateStatistics(true, std::chrono::milliseconds(500));

      // Updates statistics indicating leader was assisted after 500ms since last
      switch'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with different parameters
    code: 'TargetAssistAction action;

      action.UpdateStatistics(false, std::chrono::milliseconds(2000));

      // Updates statistics indicating no assistance occurred after 2 seconds since
      last switch'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the AI system when evaluating
    target assist actions. The internal state tracking may influence future targeting
    decisions, such as whether to wait before switching targets again or to prioritize
    certain actions over others.
