  signature: InstanceEvent InstanceEvent::RaidGroupOnlyWarning(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a warning message to the player indicating they must be in a raid group
    to proceed with the instance event.
  description: The RaidGroupOnlyWarning method is used within the InstanceEvent class
    to notify players that they are required to be part of a raid group before they
    can participate in certain instance events or activities. This method typically
    checks if the player is in a raid group and, if not, sends an appropriate warning
    message to the player's client. It is commonly used in scenarios where instance
    content is restricted to raid groups for balance or gameplay reasons. The method
    returns an InstanceEvent object, likely to allow for method chaining or to maintain
    state within the event system. This functionality supports TrinityCore's instance
    management and group-based content restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is being warned about
      raid group requirements.
  returns: Returns an InstanceEvent object, which may be used for method chaining
    or to maintain the state of the instance event after sending the warning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance event handling
    code: "InstanceEvent event;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Get player reference\nif\
      \ (!player->GetGroup() || !player->GetGroup()->isRaidGroup()) {\n    event.RaidGroupOnlyWarning(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger instance event system that manages
    player access to various content based on group composition. It's important to
    note that the player GUID parameter should be validated before use to prevent
    potential errors or exploits.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method corresponds to an active
    player in the world, as invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or client-side
    issues. Also, verify that the player is actually in a group before calling this
    method to avoid unnecessary warnings.
