  signature: void CreatureAI::JustRegisteredAreaTrigger(AreaTrigger * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature AI registers an area trigger, typically during initialization
    or activation.
  description: The JustRegisteredAreaTrigger method is invoked by the TrinityCore
    framework when a CreatureAI instance has successfully registered an area trigger.
    This method serves as a callback mechanism that allows the AI to perform specific
    actions or state updates upon the registration of an area trigger. It is commonly
    used in AI scripts to initialize behavior, set up event listeners, or modify creature
    properties based on the presence of nearby area triggers. The method does not
    accept any parameters and is typically called internally by the core engine when
    area trigger registration occurs.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Implementation Override
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustRegisteredAreaTrigger(AreaTrigger*\
      \ trigger) override\n    {\n        // Custom logic when area trigger is registered\n\
      \        if (trigger)\n        {\n            // Perform actions based on the\
      \ area trigger\n            DoSomethingWithTrigger(trigger);\n        }\n  \
      \  }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI callback system and should be overridden
    in custom AI implementations. It's important to note that this method may be called
    multiple times during a creature's lifetime if area triggers are dynamically added
    or removed. The AreaTrigger pointer passed to this method will be valid only for
    the duration of the call.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations or blocking calls within this method
    as it may affect performance. Do not modify the area trigger itself directly from
    this callback unless explicitly documented as safe to do so.
