  method: Map
  signature: TrinityCorePriority MovementPriorityMapper::Map(PlayerBotMovementPriority
    pbPriority)
documentation:
  brief: Maps a player bot movement priority to a TrinityCore movement priority value.
  description: The Map method translates a PlayerBotMovementPriority enumeration value
    into its corresponding TrinityCorePriority enumeration value. This conversion
    is essential for ensuring consistent movement behavior across different parts
    of the TrinityCore AI system. The method acts as a bridge between the bot-specific
    movement priorities and the core TrinityCore movement system, allowing bots to
    communicate their intended movement behaviors to the game engine. It performs
    a direct mapping without any additional processing or validation, assuming valid
    input values are provided.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a TrinityCorePriority value that corresponds to the input PlayerBotMovementPriority.
    The mapping ensures compatibility between bot movement logic and core TrinityCore
    movement systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Priority Mapping
    code: 'PlayerBotMovementPriority botPriority = PlayerBotMovementPriority::LOW;

      TrinityCorePriority corePriority = priorityMapper.Map(botPriority);

      // Returns the corresponding TrinityCorePriority value for LOW priority'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input PlayerBotMovementPriority is valid and
    within expected range. The implementation likely uses a simple lookup table or
    switch statement for performance optimization. Developers should ensure that all
    possible PlayerBotMovementPriority values are properly handled in the mapping
    logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the input parameter is a valid PlayerBotMovementPriority value
    to avoid undefined behavior. If new priority levels are added to PlayerBotMovementPriority,
    corresponding mappings must be implemented in this method.
