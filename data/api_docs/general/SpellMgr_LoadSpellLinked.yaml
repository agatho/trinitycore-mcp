  class: SpellMgr
  method: LoadSpellLinked
  signature: void SpellMgr::LoadSpellLinked()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the spell linked data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadSpellLinked method is responsible for loading all spell linking
    relationships from the database tables into the in-memory structures of the SpellMgr
    class. This includes loading data such as spell triggers, spell effects that are
    linked to other spells, and any conditional spell interactions. The method typically
    executes during server startup or when spell data needs to be refreshed. It processes
    the linked spell information and stores it in internal lookup tables for fast
    access during gameplay. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper spell
    behavior where one spell may trigger another, or where certain spells are dependent
    on the existence or state of other spells.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellSystem()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellLinked();\n\
      \    // Spell linking data is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    spell data needs to be reloaded. It's typically invoked after database connection
    is established but before the server begins accepting connections. The method
    performs database queries and populates internal hash tables, so it may have performance
    implications during server startup.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in internal data structures. It should not be
    called during active gameplay sessions as it may disrupt existing spell states.
