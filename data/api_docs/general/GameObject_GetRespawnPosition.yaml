  class: GameObject
  method: GetRespawnPosition
  signature: int GameObject::GetRespawnPosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the respawn position index of the GameObject, indicating its current
    respawn state in the world.
  description: The GetRespawnPosition method retrieves the respawn position index
    of a GameObject, which represents its current state within the game world's respawn
    system. This index is used to determine whether the GameObject is currently spawned
    or despawned, and helps track the object's respawn behavior during server operations.
    The method returns an integer value that corresponds to the GameObject's respawn
    position in the internal respawn tracking system, allowing developers to understand
    the object's current status and timing for respawn events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the respawn position index of the GameObject.
    This value indicates the current state of the object within the world's respawn
    system, where values typically correspond to different respawn states such as
    'spawned', 'despawned', or 'pending'. The exact meaning may vary based on internal
    implementation but generally reflects the object's current respawn status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int respawnPosition = gameObject->GetRespawnPosition();\nif (respawnPosition\
      \ == 0) {\n    // GameObject is currently despawned\n}\nelse {\n    // GameObject\
      \ is currently spawned\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with respawn tracking systems
    and may be called during server updates or when checking object states. The returned
    value should be interpreted carefully as it may vary based on internal implementation
    details. Performance considerations are minimal but may be relevant when checking
    multiple objects simultaneously.
  warnings: Care should be taken when interpreting the return value, as it may not
    always represent a straightforward 'spawned' or 'despawned' state. The method
    may return different values depending on the object's current respawn status and
    internal tracking mechanisms.
