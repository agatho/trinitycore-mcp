  signature: void ObjectGridLoader::ObjectGridLoader(NGridType & grid, int * map,
    const int & cell)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an ObjectGridLoader instance for processing grid objects in a
    specific cell of a map
  description: The ObjectGridLoader constructor initializes a loader object that handles
    loading and managing game objects within a specified grid cell of a map. This
    method is typically used during map loading or grid transition processes to ensure
    all relevant objects are properly loaded into memory. The loader uses the provided
    grid reference, map identifier array, and cell coordinates to determine which
    objects need to be processed. It prepares internal state for object loading operations
    without performing actual loading, as that is typically handled by separate methods
    in the class.
  parameters:
  - name: grid
    description: Reference to the NGridType object representing the grid cell to be
      loaded. This parameter specifies which grid area will have its objects processed.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing map identifiers. This typically
      represents the map coordinates or identifiers used to locate and organize grid
      objects within the game world.
  - name: cell
    description: Reference to an integer representing the specific cell coordinate
      within the grid. This identifies which particular cell of the grid should be
      processed by this loader instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ObjectGridLoader Initialization
    code: 'NGridType grid;

      int mapCoords[2] = {100, 200};

      int cellCoord = 5;

      ObjectGridLoader loader(grid, mapCoords, cellCoord);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore world
    management system during map loading operations. The grid parameter should be
    a valid grid object that has been properly initialized before passing to this
    constructor.
