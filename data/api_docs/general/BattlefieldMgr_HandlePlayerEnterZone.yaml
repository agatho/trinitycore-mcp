  class: BattlefieldMgr
  method: HandlePlayerEnterZone
  signature: void BattlefieldMgr::HandlePlayerEnterZone(Player * player, int zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles a player entering a specific zone and manages associated battlefield
    logic.
  description: The HandlePlayerEnterZone method is responsible for processing when
    a player enters a designated zone, typically related to battlefield or arena gameplay.
    It ensures that the player's state is correctly updated within the battlefield
    system, including assigning the appropriate battlefield, updating player flags,
    and triggering any necessary events or notifications. This method plays a crucial
    role in maintaining synchronization between the player's location and the active
    battlefield mechanics. The method does not return any value but modifies internal
    battlefield state and player data as needed.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player entering the
      zone. Must be a valid player instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: zoneId
    description: Integer identifier of the zone the player is entering. Should correspond
      to a known battlefield or arena zone ID in the game's zone database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when a player enters a battlefield zone
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player instance

      int zoneId = 1234; // Example battlefield zone ID

      BattlefieldMgr::instance()->HandlePlayerEnterZone(player, zoneId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with zone change detection system
    code: "void OnPlayerZoneChange(Player* player, uint32 newZoneId)\n{\n    if (IsBattlefieldZone(newZoneId))\n\
      \    {\n        BattlefieldMgr::instance()->HandlePlayerEnterZone(player, newZoneId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core game loop when
    a player's zone changes. It assumes that the provided zoneId corresponds to an
    active battlefield or arena instance. Developers should ensure that any custom
    zone handling logic properly calls this method for correct battlefield state management.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player pointer or an unrecognized
    zoneId may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate inputs before
    calling this method in custom code.
