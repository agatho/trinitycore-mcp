documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a party member.
  description: The IsParty method checks if the ObjectGuid instance corresponds to
    a party member within the World of Warcraft game context. This method evaluates
    the GUID's type and structure to identify if it belongs to a player or creature
    that is part of a group or party. It is commonly used in group-based gameplay
    mechanics, such as determining valid targets for party-specific spells, loot distribution,
    or communication between group members. The method does not perform any external
    lookups; it solely relies on the internal structure and type information encoded
    within the GUID itself.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a party member (player or creature
    in a party context), false otherwise. This includes players who are in a group,
    as well as creatures that are part of a party formation or have party-related
    associations.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a GUID is a party member
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);\nif (guid.IsParty())\
      \ {\n    // This GUID represents a party member\n    printf(\"GUID belongs to\
      \ a party member\\n\");\n} else {\n    // This GUID does not represent a party\
      \ member\n    printf(\"GUID does not belong to a party member\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal HighGuid type encoding within ObjectGuid.
    It is important to note that this check only verifies the GUID's association with
    party context and does not validate if the actual entity represented by the GUID
    exists or is currently online.
