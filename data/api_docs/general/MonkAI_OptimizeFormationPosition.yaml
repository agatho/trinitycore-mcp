  method: OptimizeFormationPosition
  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeFormationPosition()
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the monk's position within a formation to optimize combat effectiveness
    and resource management.
  description: The OptimizeFormationPosition method is responsible for dynamically
    repositioning a monk AI unit within a group formation. This method evaluates the
    current battlefield conditions, including threat levels, target positioning, and
    available resources such as mana or energy. It calculates an optimal position
    that maximizes the monk's ability to perform abilities like Spinning Crane Kick,
    Tiger Palm, or other combat maneuvers while maintaining proper distance from allies
    and enemies. The method ensures that the monk remains in a strategic location
    for both damage output and support roles within the group structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n        me->GetAI()->OptimizeFormationPosition();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Monk AI Logic
    code: "class MyMonkAI : public MonkAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (me->IsInCombat()) {\n            OptimizeFormationPosition();\n\
      \            // Additional custom logic here\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates and should be used
    sparingly to avoid performance overhead. The optimization algorithm considers
    factors such as distance to targets, proximity to allies, and current cooldowns
    of key abilities.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context unless the AI logic
    specifically requires it, as it may cause unexpected positioning behavior or resource
    mismanagement.
