  class: CategoryMemoryStats
  method: RecordAllocation
  signature: void CategoryMemoryStats::RecordAllocation(uint64_t size)
documentation:
  brief: Records a memory allocation of the specified size within the category's memory
    statistics.
  description: The RecordAllocation method is used to track memory allocations within
    a specific category. It updates internal counters and statistics to reflect the
    newly allocated memory block. This method is typically called by the memory management
    system when new objects are created or memory blocks are reserved. The method
    does not perform any actual allocation itself, but rather records the occurrence
    of an allocation event for statistical purposes. It's part of the memory profiling
    infrastructure used to monitor and analyze memory usage patterns in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: size
    description: The size in bytes of the memory allocation being recorded. Must be
      a positive integer value representing the amount of memory allocated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CategoryMemoryStats stats;

      stats.RecordAllocation(1024); // Records a 1KB allocation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Memory Allocation Tracking
    code: "void* CustomAlloc(size_t size) {\n    void* ptr = malloc(size);\n    memoryStats.RecordAllocation(size);\n\
      \    return ptr;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within memory allocation wrappers or
    hooks. The implementation may be thread-safe depending on the underlying statistics
    collection mechanism. It's important to ensure that all allocations are properly
    recorded for accurate profiling data.
  warnings: Calling this method with a size of zero may lead to unexpected behavior
    in statistical calculations. Ensure that only valid, non-zero allocation sizes
    are passed to maintain data integrity.
