  class: Unit
  method: SetModSpellHaste
  signature: void Unit::SetModSpellHaste(float spellHaste)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spell haste modifier for the unit, affecting spell casting speed.
  description: This method modifies the spell haste percentage for a Unit, which influences
    how quickly spells are cast. Spell haste reduces the casting time of spells, making
    them faster to execute. The method adjusts the overall spell casting speed based
    on the provided value, typically used in game mechanics involving buffs or debuffs
    that affect spell casting time.
  parameters:
  - name: spellHaste
    description: The spell haste percentage modifier to apply to the unit's spell
      casting speed. Positive values reduce casting time, while negative values increase
      it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      target->SetModSpellHaste(25.0f); // Apply 25% haste to spell casting speed'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with buff application
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit();

      player->SetModSpellHaste(-10.0f); // Apply 10% slow to spell casting speed

      // This could be used in a scenario where a debuff is applied'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects the internal spell casting time calculations within
    the Unit class, and may interact with other spell-related modifiers such as haste
    or slow effects. Performance considerations include potential impact on spell
    cooldowns and overall gameplay balance.
  warnings: Care should be taken when applying negative values to spellHaste, as this
    can significantly slow down spell casting and potentially disrupt game balance.
    This method should not be used in isolation without considering other related
    modifiers.
