  class: MarksmanshipCastManager
  method: MarksmanshipCastManager
  signature: void MarksmanshipCastManager::MarksmanshipCastManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a MarksmanshipCastManager instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The MarksmanshipCastManager constructor initializes the casting manager
    for a player bot, setting up internal state and configurations required for managing
    marksmanship-related spell casts. This includes initializing tracking variables,
    setting up necessary data structures, and preparing the bot's casting behavior
    according to marksmanship class mechanics. The method ensures that the bot is
    properly configured to handle marksmanship-specific abilities such as Aimed Shot,
    Steady Shot, and other ranged attacks within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will use this
      marksmanship cast manager. Must be a valid player instance with marksmanship
      specialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot

      MarksmanshipCastManager castManager(myBot);

      // Manager is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI System
    code: "class MyAI : public PlayerbotAI {\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\n   \
      \ {\n        // Assuming we have access to a bot player\n        MarksmanshipCastManager*\
      \ manager = new MarksmanshipCastManager(bot);\n        // Use manager for casting\
      \ logic\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The manager
    assumes that the provided player has already been initialized with proper marksmanship
    specialization and stats. Internal state tracking is initialized to default values,
    which may be overridden by subsequent configuration calls.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'bot' will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure the Player object is fully constructed and valid before passing
    it to this constructor.
