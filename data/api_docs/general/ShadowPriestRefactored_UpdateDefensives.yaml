documentation:
  brief: Updates the shadow priest's defensive abilities and cooldowns based on current
    game state.
  description: 'The UpdateDefensives method manages the activation, deactivation,
    and cooldown tracking of all defensive abilities available to the Shadow Priest
    AI. This includes handling mana management, spell prioritization, and ensuring
    that defensive cooldowns are used optimally during combat. The method evaluates
    the current threat level, player health, and available resources to determine
    when and how to apply defensive spells such as Power Word: Shield, Pain Suppression,
    or other relevant abilities. It is typically called during the AI''s update cycle
    to maintain optimal defensive posture throughout encounters.'

    code: "void ShadowPriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateDefensives();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making loop and should be called
    regularly during combat updates. It assumes that the AI has access to valid target
    information and player state data. The implementation may vary depending on the
    specific version of TrinityCore and the shadow priest's specialization.
  warnings: Improper handling of defensive cooldowns can lead to reduced survivability
    in high-damage encounters. Ensure that this method is not called too frequently
    without proper cooldown management to avoid performance issues or spell spamming.
