documentation:
  brief: Retrieves fallback item IDs associated with a quest package ID from the database.
  description: The GetQuestPackageItemsFallback method retrieves an array of item
    IDs that serve as fallback items for a given quest package ID. This functionality
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's quest system to provide alternative rewards
    when the primary quest reward cannot be awarded, such as when a player's inventory
    is full or certain conditions are not met. The returned pointer points to an internal
    static array that should not be modified or freed by the caller. The method accesses
    data stored in DB2 files, specifically those related to quest packages and their
    associated items.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointing to the first element of an array containing item
    IDs associated with the specified quest package ID. Returns nullptr if no fallback
    items are found for the given quest package ID or if the quest package ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through fallback items for a quest package
    code: "const int* items = sDB2Manager->GetQuestPackageItemsFallback(12345);\n\
      if (items != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10 && items[i] != 0; ++i)\n\
      \    {\n        printf(\"Fallback item ID: %d\\n\", items[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures and should only be called
    after the DB2 files have been loaded. The returned array is static and must not
    be freed or modified by the caller. The size of the returned array is not explicitly
    provided; it's up to the caller to determine where the list ends (typically indicated
    by a zero value).
  warnings: The returned pointer points to internal data that may change between calls
    or during runtime, so avoid storing references to it for extended periods. This
    method assumes valid quest package IDs and does not perform validation on input
    parameters.
