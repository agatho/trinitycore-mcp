  class: PathfindingUtils
  method: GetGroundDistance
  signature: float PathfindingUtils::GetGroundDistance(const int & pos, Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the ground distance between two points in a given map.
  description: The GetGroundDistance method computes the horizontal distance between
    two positions on the ground within a specified map. This utility function is commonly
    used in pathfinding and movement calculations for NPCs and players. The method
    takes into account the map's terrain and height information to provide an accurate
    ground-based distance measurement. It requires valid map and position parameters
    to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer representing a position identifier or coordinate.
      This typically corresponds to a specific location within the map's coordinate
      system.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to a Map object that represents the game world area where
      the distance calculation should be performed. Must not be null for valid operation.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated ground distance between
    the specified points in the given map. The value is measured in game units (typically
    yards or meters depending on the map configuration). Returns zero if invalid parameters
    are provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float distance = PathfindingUtils::GetGroundDistance(12345, player->GetMap());\n\
      if (distance > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use calculated distance\n    std::cout << \"\
      Ground distance: \" << distance << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Pathfinding Distance Check
    code: "uint32 start_pos = 54321;\nuint32 end_pos = 67890;\nMap* current_map =\
      \ player->GetMap();\nfloat dist = PathfindingUtils::GetGroundDistance(start_pos,\
      \ current_map);\nif (dist > 10.0f)\n{\n    // Trigger long-distance movement\
      \ logic\n    player->MoveTowards(end_pos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying map's height data to compute accurate
    ground distances. Ensure that the provided map pointer is valid and not null before
    calling this function. The position parameter should represent a valid location
    within the map's coordinate system for meaningful results.
  warnings: Passing a null map pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or
    crash. Make sure the position identifier corresponds to an actual point in the
    map space. This method does not account for obstacles or line-of-sight; it only
    calculates straight-line ground distance.
