  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::SetLimits(const PerformanceLimits & limits)
documentation:
  brief: Sets performance limits for machine learning operations within the tracker
  description: Configures the maximum resource usage thresholds for machine learning
    performance tracking. This method allows developers to define constraints on CPU,
    memory, and execution time that the ML system should not exceed. The limits are
    applied immediately and affect all subsequent ML operations tracked by this instance.
    This is crucial for maintaining server stability and preventing excessive resource
    consumption during AI-driven gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: limits
    description: A PerformanceLimits structure containing the maximum allowed values
      for CPU usage, memory consumption, and execution time thresholds that define
      the operational boundaries for ML performance tracking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Basic Performance Limits
    code: 'PerformanceLimits limits;

      limits.maxCpuUsage = 80.0f;

      limits.maxMemoryUsage = 512.0f;

      limits.maxExecutionTimeMs = 100;

      tracker.SetLimits(limits);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Strict Resource Constraints
    code: 'PerformanceLimits strictLimits;

      strictLimits.maxCpuUsage = 60.0f;

      strictLimits.maxMemoryUsage = 256.0f;

      strictLimits.maxExecutionTimeMs = 50;

      tracker.SetLimits(strictLimits);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method overrides any previously set limits. The PerformanceLimits structure
    should be validated before calling to ensure values are within acceptable ranges.
    Changes take effect immediately for all subsequent ML operations.
  warnings: Setting limits too restrictive may cause ML operations to fail or perform
    poorly. Ensure that limit values are reasonable for your server's hardware capabilities
    and gameplay requirements.
