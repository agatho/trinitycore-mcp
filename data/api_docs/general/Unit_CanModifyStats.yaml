documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit can modify its stats
  description: This method checks if a unit (such as a player or creature) is allowed
    to modify its own stats, including attributes like strength, agility, intellect,
    and other stat-related properties. It typically returns true when the unit has
    permission to adjust its stats, such as during character creation or when certain
    game mechanics are active. The method is often used in conjunction with other
    stat-related functions to ensure that modifications are allowed within the game's
    rules and constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is allowed to modify its stats, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the unit can perform stat adjustments based on game mechanics
    and restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->CanModifyStats()) {\n    // Perform stat modifications\n}\nelse\
      \ {\n    // Do not modify stats\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other stat-related methods
    to ensure that modifications are allowed. It may be affected by game state, such
    as when a player is in combat or when certain conditions prevent stat changes.
  warnings: This method should not be used to directly modify stats without checking
    the result first; modifying stats without verifying this condition can lead to
    game rule violations or unexpected behavior.
