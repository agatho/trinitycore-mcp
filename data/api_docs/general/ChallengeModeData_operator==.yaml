  method: operator==
  signature: bool ChallengeModeData::operator==(const ChallengeModeData & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ChallengeModeData objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    ChallengeModeData object and another ChallengeModeData object. It returns true
    if all corresponding members of both objects are equal, and false otherwise. This
    comparison is typically used to determine if two challenge mode dungeon runs have
    identical data, such as the same level, time, and reward information. The method
    is const, meaning it does not modify either object during comparison.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The ChallengeModeData object to compare against this object.
  returns: True if all members of both ChallengeModeData objects are equal; false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two ChallengeModeData objects
    code: 'ChallengeModeData data1;

      ChallengeModeData data2;

      bool isEqual = (data1 == data2); // Returns true if both objects have identical
      data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using equality operator in a conditional statement
    code: "if (playerChallengeData == savedChallengeData) {\n    // Player's current\
      \ challenge mode data matches saved data\n    SendNotification(\"Challenge mode\
      \ data unchanged\");\n} else {\n    // Data has changed, update saved state\n\
      \    SaveChallengeModeData(playerChallengeData);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely compares key fields such as dungeon level, completion
    time, and reward identifiers. This operator is essential for identifying when
    challenge mode progress has not changed between sessions or updates.
