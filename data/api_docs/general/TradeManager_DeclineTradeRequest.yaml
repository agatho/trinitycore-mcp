  signature: bool TradeManager::DeclineTradeRequest(int requesterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Declines a pending trade request from another player.
  description: The DeclineTradeRequest method is used to reject an active trade request
    initiated by another player. This method handles the cleanup of trade state and
    sends appropriate notifications to both parties involved in the trade. It ensures
    that any temporary trade data is properly removed from memory and that the trading
    interface is closed for both players. The method typically gets called when a
    player chooses not to proceed with a trade after receiving a trade request.
  parameters:
  - name: requesterGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the player who initiated
      the trade request. This parameter identifies which specific trade request should
      be declined.
  returns: Returns true if the trade request was successfully declined and cleaned
    up, or false if no active trade request exists for the specified requester GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Decline a Trade Request
    code: "if (tradeManager.DeclineTradeRequest(playerGuid)) {\n    // Trade request\
      \ successfully declined\n    player->SendNotification(\"Trade request declined.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // No active trade request found for this player\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      No pending trade request to decline.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the TradeManager maintains internal state tracking
    of active trade requests. It should only be called when a valid trade session
    exists for the given requester GUID. The method may also trigger additional cleanup
    operations such as removing temporary trade items or resetting player states.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that a trade request actually exists
    for the provided GUID may result in unexpected behavior or silent failures. Ensure
    proper validation of the requester GUID before invoking this method.
