  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: UpdatePerformanceMetrics
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::UpdatePerformanceMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates performance metrics for NPC interactions within the TrinityCore server.
  description: The UpdatePerformanceMetrics method collects and processes timing data
    related to NPC interaction handling, including response times, processing overhead,
    and resource utilization. This method is typically invoked periodically or upon
    significant changes in NPC interaction activity to maintain accurate performance
    statistics. The collected metrics help developers identify bottlenecks and optimize
    NPC behavior in the game world. It operates on internal tracking structures and
    does not directly interact with external systems or players.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* manager = sWorld->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      manager->UpdatePerformanceMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called from within the server's main loop or at regular
    intervals to ensure accurate performance tracking. It may impact performance slightly
    during execution due to data collection and processing overhead.
