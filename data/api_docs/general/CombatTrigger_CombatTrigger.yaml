documentation:
  brief: Initializes a combat trigger with the specified name for handling combat-related
    events in the game world.
  description: The CombatTrigger constructor initializes a new combat trigger instance
    with the provided name. This method sets up the internal state required to manage
    combat-related events and interactions within the TrinityCore framework. The name
    parameter serves as a unique identifier for the trigger, allowing developers to
    distinguish between different combat triggers in their scripts or AI behaviors.
    This initialization is typically called when creating custom combat logic or integrating
    with existing combat systems. The method does not return any value but prepares
    the object for subsequent operations such as event registration, activation, or
    deactivation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Trigger Initialization
    code: 'CombatTrigger trigger("PlayerCombatTrigger");

      // Initializes a new combat trigger with the name "PlayerCombatTrigger"'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Combat Triggers
    code: 'CombatTrigger playerTrigger("PlayerCombat");

      CombatTrigger npcTrigger("NPCCombat");

      CombatTrigger areaTrigger("AreaCombat");

      // Creates three distinct combat triggers for different game entities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat trigger methods
    such as Activate(), Deactivate(), and RegisterEvent(). The name parameter should
    be unique within the scope of active triggers to prevent conflicts. This constructor
    does not perform any validation on the input name, so developers should ensure
    proper naming conventions are followed.
  warnings: Ensure that the name parameter is properly sanitized if it comes from
    external sources to avoid potential issues with trigger identification or conflicts.
    Since this is a constructor, calling it multiple times on the same object will
    result in undefined behavior unless the object is properly reset between calls.
