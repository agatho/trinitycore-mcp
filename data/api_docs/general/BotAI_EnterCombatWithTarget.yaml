  class: BotAI
  method: EnterCombatWithTarget
  signature: void BotAI::EnterCombatWithTarget(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates combat with the specified target unit.
  description: The EnterCombatWithTarget method is used by bot AI to engage a specific
    target unit in combat. This method handles the necessary steps to transition the
    bot from idle or passive state into active combat mode against the provided target.
    The method typically sets up combat-related flags, initiates attack behavior,
    and may handle target selection logic depending on the bot's configuration. It
    is commonly used when a bot needs to start fighting a particular enemy, such as
    during quest objectives or scripted encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that the bot should enter combat with.
      This parameter must be a valid pointer to an existing unit in the game world;
      passing a null pointer may result in undefined behavior or errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Entry
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    botAI->EnterCombatWithTarget(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Combat Entry
    code: "if (botAI->GetBot()->GetMap() && botAI->GetBot()->IsAlive())\n{\n    Unit*\
      \ target = botAI->GetBot()->GetVictim();\n    if (target && target->IsInWorld())\n\
      \    {\n        botAI->EnterCombatWithTarget(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the target unit is valid and in the same map as the bot.
    It does not perform any checks for line of sight or range; these should be handled
    by calling code before invoking this method. The bot's AI state machine may override
    this call if the bot is already in combat with another target.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the target parameter can lead to crashes or
    undefined behavior. Always verify that the target unit exists and is valid before
    calling this method. Additionally, ensure the target is within appropriate range
    and visible to avoid unexpected combat behavior.
