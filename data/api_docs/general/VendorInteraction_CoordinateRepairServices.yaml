documentation:
  brief: Coordinates repair services for a player by interacting with the vendor's
    repair interface.
  description: The CoordinateRepairServices method handles the logic for allowing
    a player to repair their items through a vendor interaction. It typically checks
    if the player has items that can be repaired, calculates the cost based on item
    durability and vendor settings, and processes the repair transaction. This method
    is part of the general vendor interaction system in TrinityCore and integrates
    with the game's economy and item management systems. The method assumes the player
    is within range of a repair-enabled vendor and that appropriate preconditions
    such as sufficient funds are met.

  - title: Basic Vendor Repair Interaction
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      VendorInteraction vendor;

      vendor.CoordinateRepairServices(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's inventory and the vendor's
    repair cost calculation system. It may trigger UI updates or send packets to the
    client to reflect repair status changes.
