  class: BrewmasterShuffleTracker
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool BrewmasterShuffleTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the Brewmaster Shuffle effect is currently active on the player.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the Brewmaster Shuffle buff, which
    provides increased movement speed and dodge chance, is currently applied to the
    player character. This method is typically used within the context of the Brewmaster
    monk's ability system to verify the state of the shuffle effect before applying
    additional mechanics or displaying visual feedback. The check considers all active
    buffs and debuffs that may affect the player's movement and combat abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Brewmaster Shuffle effect is currently active, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the player has the buff applied and is benefiting
    from its effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (player->GetBrewmasterShuffleTracker()->IsActive()) {\n    // Apply\
      \ additional effects or modify combat behavior\n    player->ModifySpeed(1.2f);\
      \ // Increase speed by 20%\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Shuffle State Before Ability Usage
    code: "BrewmasterShuffleTracker* tracker = player->GetBrewmasterShuffleTracker();\n\
      if (!tracker->IsActive()) {\n    // Player cannot use certain abilities without\
      \ shuffle active\n    player->SendSpellFailed(abilityId, SPELL_FAILED_NO_COMBO_POINTS);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check against the internal tracking system
    for Brewmaster Shuffle. It does not modify any game state or trigger side effects.
    The implementation likely relies on checking the presence of specific aura effects
    or buff stacks associated with the Brewmaster Shuffle ability.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only reflects the current active state and does
    not account for potential delays in effect application or removal. Also, ensure
    proper null-checking when accessing the tracker object to prevent crashes if the
    player doesn't have a valid tracker instance.
