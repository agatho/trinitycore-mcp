documentation:
  brief: Returns the world state values for the map
  description: This method retrieves the current world state values associated with
    the map instance. World state values represent dynamic game variables that control
    various in-game systems such as seasonal events, achievements, or global game
    mechanics. The returned reference allows access to these values without copying,
    making it efficient for performance-critical operations. This method is commonly
    used in conjunction with WorldState management systems to monitor and update game
    conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a constant reference to an integer representing the world state
    value. This value typically corresponds to a specific game state or condition
    that can be modified by various triggers or events within the map.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing World State Values
    code: "int const& worldState = map->GetWorldStateValues();\nif (worldState !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Process world state value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a constant reference to avoid unnecessary copying of data.
    It's important to note that world state values may change during gameplay, so
    accessing this value should be done carefully to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: This method should not be used for modifying world state values directly;
    it only provides read access. Modifications should be handled through proper WorldState
    update mechanisms rather than direct reference manipulation.
