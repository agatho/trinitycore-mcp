  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: UpdateZonePopulation
  signature: void BotSpawnerOptimized::UpdateZonePopulation(uint32 zoneId, uint32
    mapId, uint32 realPlayers)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the population count for bots in a specified zone and map.
  description: The UpdateZonePopulation method is responsible for maintaining accurate
    bot population data within a specific zone and map context. This method adjusts
    internal tracking mechanisms to reflect the current number of real players in
    the zone, which can influence bot spawning behavior and distribution. It serves
    as a core component in dynamic bot management systems that adapt to player activity
    levels across different areas of the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone where population is being updated.
      This value corresponds to the zone ID used internally by TrinityCore's map system.
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map containing the specified zone. Used
      in conjunction with zoneId to determine the exact location context for bot population
      tracking.
  - name: realPlayers
    description: The count of real players currently present in the specified zone.
      This value determines how many bots should be spawned or adjusted in that area.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Zone Population Update
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized spawner;

      spawner.UpdateZonePopulation(1234, 5678, 15);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Population After Player Join
    code: 'uint32 zoneId = player->GetZoneId();

      uint32 mapId = player->GetMapId();

      uint32 currentPlayers = GetPlayerCountInZone(zoneId, mapId);

      spawner.UpdateZonePopulation(zoneId, mapId, currentPlayers);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called whenever a player enters or leaves a zone
    to maintain accurate population data for bot spawning logic. It may trigger internal
    recalculations of bot distribution and spawn rates based on the updated real player
    count.
