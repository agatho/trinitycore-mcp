  class: PerformanceProfile
  method: GetMetricTrend
  signature: float PerformanceProfile::GetMetricTrend(PerformanceMetric metric) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the trend value for a specified performance metric.
  description: The GetMetricTrend method computes and retrieves the trend of a given
    performance metric, which is typically used to analyze system performance over
    time. This method is part of the PerformanceProfile class that tracks various
    metrics related to server performance, such as update times, frame rates, or resource
    usage. The returned float value represents the calculated trend, often expressed
    as a rate of change or percentage difference from a baseline. This functionality
    is essential for monitoring and optimizing the performance of TrinityCore servers
    in real-time environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the computed trend for the specified
    performance metric. The value may be positive (indicating an increase), negative
    (indicating a decrease), or zero (indicating no change).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float trend = profile.GetMetricTrend(PerformanceMetric::UpdateDuration);

      std::cout << "Update duration trend: " << trend << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring with Trend Analysis
    code: "PerformanceProfile profile;\n// Assume profile has been populated with\
      \ data\nfloat frameRateTrend = profile.GetMetricTrend(PerformanceMetric::FrameRate);\n\
      if (frameRateTrend < -0.1f) {\n    // Alert: Frame rate is dropping significantly\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Frame rate declining by %.2f%%\", frameRateTrend\
      \ * 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations based on historical data points
    stored within the PerformanceProfile instance. It may use statistical methods
    such as linear regression or moving averages to determine trends. The accuracy
    of trend calculation depends on sufficient historical data being available.
  warnings: Ensure that the PerformanceProfile instance has been properly initialized
    and populated with relevant metric data before calling this method, otherwise
    the returned trend value may be meaningless or cause unexpected behavior.
