api:
  class: Map
  method: GetWaterLevel
  signature: float Map::GetWaterLevel(const PhaseShift & phaseShift, float x, float
    y)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the water level at specified coordinates within the map.
  description: The GetWaterLevel method returns the Z-coordinate of the water surface
    at given 2D coordinates (x, y) for a specific phase shift. This is essential for
    determining whether objects are submerged or if players can swim in certain areas.
    The method accounts for different phase states and provides accurate water level
    information for gameplay mechanics involving water interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: The phase shift object that defines the current phase state of the
      map, including any active phase masks or flags affecting visibility.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate (horizontal) where water level is being queried.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate (horizontal) where water level is being queried.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the Z-coordinate of the water surface
    at the specified coordinates, or 0.0f if no water exists at that location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float zLevel = map->GetWaterLevel(phaseShift, x, y);\nif (zLevel > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Water exists here\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No water at this location\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with collision detection systems
    to determine if an object or player is submerged. Performance considerations include
    caching of water level values for frequently accessed locations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using coordinates outside the map boundaries as this
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure that phaseShift is
    properly initialized before calling this method.
