documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature can perform melee attacks
  description: The CanMelee method checks if a creature is capable of engaging in
    melee combat, which includes both attacking with its primary weapon and performing
    melee attacks. This method evaluates various conditions such as the creature's
    current state, target validity, and whether it has a valid melee attack target.
    It is commonly used in AI behavior scripts to determine if a creature should engage
    in melee combat during combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature can perform melee attacks, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the creature is not in combat or when it lacks a
    valid target for melee attack.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI script
    code: "if (creature->CanMelee()) {\n    // Perform melee attack\n    creature->AttackMelee();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    like CanAutoAttack or CanSpellAttack. It's important to note that the method may
    return false even if a creature has a valid target, due to conditions such as
    being stunned or having no attack power.
  warnings: This method does not account for the creature's current state or whether
    it is in combat mode. Developers should ensure that proper checks are performed
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
