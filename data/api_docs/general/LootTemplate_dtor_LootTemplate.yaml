documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LootTemplate object and releases all associated memory resources.
  description: The LootTemplate destructor is responsible for cleaning up all dynamically
    allocated memory and resources used by the LootTemplate instance. This includes
    releasing any internal data structures that store loot item definitions, probability
    weights, and other template metadata. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this method ensures proper cleanup when a loot template (such as for a specific
    creature or game object) is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks and maintaining
    system stability. The destructor is automatically invoked when the LootTemplate
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of LootTemplate instance
    code: 'LootTemplate* lootTemplate = new LootTemplate();

      // ... use the loot template ...

      delete lootTemplate; // Triggers ~LootTemplate()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via smart pointer
    code: '#include <memory>

      std::unique_ptr<LootTemplate> lootTemplate = std::make_unique<LootTemplate>();

      // ... use the loot template ...

      // ~LootTemplate() automatically called when unique_ptr goes out of scope'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for memory
    management in TrinityCore's loot system. It is important to note that this method
    should not be called directly unless you have explicit ownership of the object.
    The destruction process handles all internal resource deallocation, including
    any linked lists or containers that may contain loot item entries.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor unless you are certain about object
    ownership and memory management. Improper use can lead to double-free errors or
    undefined behavior. Also, ensure that no other objects hold references to the
    template before destruction, as dangling pointers may cause crashes.
