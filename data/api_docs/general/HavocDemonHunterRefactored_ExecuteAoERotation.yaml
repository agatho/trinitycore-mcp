  signature: void HavocDemonHunterRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32
    enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the havoc demon hunter's AoE rotation logic for targeting multiple
    enemies
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for a havoc
    demon hunter's area-of-effect combat rotation. This method determines the optimal
    sequence of abilities and spells to cast when multiple enemies are present, prioritizing
    damage output while managing resource usage such as fury and soul fragments. It
    evaluates the current combat state, enemy positions, and available cooldowns to
    select the most effective abilities for maximum AoE damage within the constraints
    of the class's gameplay mechanics. The method assumes that the AI has already
    identified a valid target array and enemy count for processing.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the IDs or references of
      targets in the current AoE environment. Each element corresponds to a single
      enemy unit within range.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the total number of enemies currently
      within the demon hunter's effective AoE range. Must be greater than zero for
      meaningful execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: 'int targets[5] = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005};

      uint32 count = 5;

      hunter->ExecuteAoERotation(targets, count);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Management with Rotation
    code: "std::vector<int> enemyTargets;\n// Populate enemyTargets with valid unit\
      \ IDs\nuint32 targetCount = static_cast<uint32>(enemyTargets.size());\nif (targetCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    hunter->ExecuteAoERotation(enemyTargets.data(), targetCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the AI's main execution
    loop during combat scenarios. It does not perform any validation on input parameters
    beyond basic type checking, so callers should ensure that 'target' points to a
    valid array and 'enemyCount' reflects actual enemy presence. The implementation
    may utilize internal state tracking for cooldowns, resource management, and ability
    prioritization.
  warnings: Calling this method without valid targets or with an enemyCount of zero
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect AI decision-making. Ensure that the
    target array is properly populated before invoking this function. This method
    modifies internal AI state and should not be called concurrently from multiple
    threads without proper synchronization.
