documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the death recovery statistics for the DeathRecoveryManager instance.
  description: The GetStatistics method provides access to a constant reference of
    the DeathRecoveryStatistics structure, which contains aggregated data about death-related
    events and recovery actions within the game. This includes information such as
    total deaths, successful recoveries, and other relevant metrics that track player
    survival and revival behavior. The returned statistics object is read-only and
    should not be modified directly. This method is typically used for monitoring
    player behavior, balancing game mechanics, or generating reports on death-related
    gameplay elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a DeathRecoveryStatistics object containing aggregated
    death recovery metrics. The statistics are immutable and represent the cumulative
    data since the manager was initialized or last reset.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Death Recovery Statistics
    code: 'const DeathRecoveryStatistics& stats = deathRecoveryManager.GetStatistics();

      uint32 totalDeaths = stats.TotalDeaths;

      uint32 successfulRecoveries = stats.SuccessfulRecoveries;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference is valid only as long as the DeathRecoveryManager
    instance exists. The statistics are updated incrementally as death events occur
    and recovery actions are processed. This method does not perform any locking or
    synchronization internally, so thread safety must be handled by the caller if
    accessed from multiple threads.
