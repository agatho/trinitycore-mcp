  class: MovementAction
  method: Execute
  signature: ActionResult MovementAction::Execute(BotAI * ai, const ActionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the movement action within the bot's AI context, determining and
    performing the appropriate movement behavior.
  description: The Execute method of the MovementAction class is responsible for carrying
    out the defined movement logic within the TrinityCore bot AI system. It takes
    the current AI context and performs necessary calculations to determine how the
    bot should move, whether that be walking, running, jumping, or other locomotion
    behaviors. This method integrates with the broader AI decision-making framework
    to ensure coordinated and realistic character movement. The action's result is
    returned as an ActionResult which indicates success, failure, or other states
    that may affect subsequent AI processing. This method typically operates within
    the context of a larger bot behavior tree or state machine.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the current bot's behavior
      and decision-making process
  - name: context
    description: Reference to the ActionContext containing current game state, target
      information, and contextual data needed for movement decisions
  returns: ActionResult indicating the outcome of the movement execution. Possible
    values include success, failure, or other status codes that influence AI flow
    control.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Execution
    code: "ActionResult result = movementAction.Execute(ai, context);\nif (result\
      \ == ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Movement completed successfully\n    ai->SetNextAction(ActionType::IDLE);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle movement failure\n    ai->SetNextAction(ActionType::RETRY_MOVEMENT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Movement with Context Awareness
    code: "ActionResult result = movementAction.Execute(ai, context);\nswitch (result)\
      \ {\n    case ActionResult::SUCCESS:\n        // Continue with next action\n\
      \        break;\n    case ActionResult::FAILED:\n        // Retry or fallback\
      \ to alternative movement\n        ai->SetNextAction(ActionType::FIND_ALTERNATIVE_PATH);\n\
      \        break;\n    case ActionResult::PENDING:\n        // Movement in progress,\
      \ check again later\n        ai->SetNextAction(ActionType::WAIT_FOR_MOVEMENT);\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI's main execution loop
    and should be thread-safe as it may be invoked concurrently with other AI operations.
    The context parameter must contain valid data for movement calculations to succeed,
    including target positions and environmental constraints.
  warnings: Improper handling of ActionResult codes can lead to infinite loops or
    incorrect bot behavior. Ensure that all possible return values are properly handled
    in the calling code. This method may block if movement requires pathfinding calculations
    which could impact AI responsiveness.
