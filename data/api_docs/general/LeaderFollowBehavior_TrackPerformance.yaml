  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: TrackPerformance
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds
    duration, const std::string & operation)
documentation:
  brief: Records performance metrics for leader-follow behavior operations.
  description: The TrackPerformance method logs timing information for specific operations
    within the LeaderFollowBehavior class. It accepts a duration measurement and an
    operation identifier to track how long various leader-follow actions take. This
    functionality is crucial for monitoring AI performance and identifying potential
    bottlenecks in player following behavior. The method likely stores this data for
    debugging, profiling, or optimization purposes. No preconditions are required
    for calling this method, and it does not return any value.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The time duration of the operation measured in microseconds. This
      parameter represents how long a specific leader-follow behavior operation took
      to complete.
  - name: operation
    description: A string identifier describing the type of operation being tracked.
      This helps categorize performance data for analysis and debugging purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Tracking
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior behavior;

      std::chrono::microseconds duration(1500);

      behavior.TrackPerformance(duration, "UpdatePosition");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Multiple Operations
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior behavior;

      behavior.TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds(2300), "CheckDistance");

      behavior.TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds(850), "AdjustSpeed");

      behavior.TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds(1200), "Pathfinding");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with performance monitoring systems
    within TrinityCore to analyze AI behavior efficiency. It may store data in internal
    buffers or log files for later analysis by developers or system administrators.
