  method: GetTimer
  signature: int32 Spell::GetTimer() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for the spell's cooldown.
  description: The GetTimer method retrieves the current cooldown time remaining for
    a spell, expressed in milliseconds. This value represents how long the spell must
    wait before it can be used again. The method is commonly used in conjunction with
    spell cooldowns and game mechanics that require timing information. It is particularly
    useful for determining when a spell is ready to be cast again after its cooldown
    period has elapsed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the remaining time in milliseconds
    until the spell can be used again. A value of 0 indicates that the spell is currently
    available for use, while negative values indicate that the spell is still on cooldown
    but has already passed its cooldown period.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 cooldownTime = spell->GetTimer();\nif (cooldownTime <= 0)\n{\n  \
      \  // Spell is available\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Spell is on cooldown\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the GetSpellInfo() function
    to determine if a spell is ready to be cast. The returned value is directly related
    to the spell's cooldown period and may vary depending on the game mechanics involved.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can lead to incorrect behavior
    if not properly handled. Ensure that the spell being checked is actually on cooldown
    before relying on this value.
