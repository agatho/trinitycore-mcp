documentation:
  brief: Checks if a prioritized action is valid within the action priority queue.
  description: The IsActionValid method determines whether a given PrioritizedAction
    object meets the criteria for validity within the ActionPriorityQueue. This validation
    typically involves checking if the action has valid parameters, is not expired,
    and conforms to the queue's internal rules. The method is used internally by the
    action priority queue to filter out invalid actions before processing them. It
    ensures that only properly formed actions are considered during AI decision-making
    processes in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: The PrioritizedAction object to validate within the queue context.
      This represents an action with associated priority and target information.
  returns: Returns true if the action is valid according to the queue's validation
    rules, false otherwise. An invalid action may be due to missing targets, expired
    timestamps, or other constraint violations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "ActionPriorityQueue queue;\nPrioritizedAction action;\n// ... populate\
      \ action with valid data ...\nbool isValid = queue.IsActionValid(action);\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Process the action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "ActionPriorityQueue queue;\nstd::vector<PrioritizedAction> actions = GetAvailableActions();\n\
      for (const auto& action : actions)\n{\n    if (queue.IsActionValid(action))\n\
      \    {\n        // Add valid action to processing list\n        queue.AddAction(action);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during action validation phases within the
    AI system. It's important to note that this check may involve checking for target
    validity, action expiration, and other constraints specific to the TrinityCore
    AI framework. The implementation likely performs lightweight checks to avoid performance
    bottlenecks in high-frequency AI decision loops.
  warnings: Developers should be aware that invalid actions returned by this method
    may still be processed by other systems if not properly filtered out. Additionally,
    calling IsActionValid on an uninitialized or improperly constructed PrioritizedAction
    object could lead to undefined behavior or false negatives.
