  class: AbstractFollower
  method: ~AbstractFollower
  signature: void AbstractFollower::~AbstractFollower()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AbstractFollower instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AbstractFollower class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used by the follower
    object. This method is automatically invoked when an AbstractFollower object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's World of
    Warcraft emulation, this could involve releasing references to creature data,
    removing the follower from active lists, or performing cleanup operations necessary
    for proper memory management. The destructor ensures that no memory leaks occur
    and that all subsystems are properly notified of the follower's removal.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of AbstractFollower
    code: 'AbstractFollower* follower = new AbstractFollower();

      // ... use the follower ...

      delete follower; // Triggers ~AbstractFollower()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically called automatically by the C++ runtime when
    an object is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process
    may involve calling base class destructors and cleaning up any internal data structures
    or pointers held by the follower.
