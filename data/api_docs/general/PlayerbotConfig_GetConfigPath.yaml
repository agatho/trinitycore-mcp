documentation:
  brief: Returns the file system path to the playerbot configuration directory
  description: The GetConfigPath method retrieves the absolute file system path where
    playerbot configuration files are stored. This path is typically constructed based
    on the game installation directory and a predefined subdirectory structure for
    bot configurations. The returned path can be used to locate or manipulate playerbot
    settings files, such as bot behavior scripts, strategy definitions, or custom
    configuration files. This method is essential for initializing playerbot systems
    and ensuring proper file access during runtime operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the absolute file system path to the playerbot
    configuration directory
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::string configPath = playerbotConfig->GetConfigPath();

      std::cout << "Playerbot config path: " << configPath << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Path for File Operations
    code: 'std::string configPath = playerbotConfig->GetConfigPath();

      std::string botFile = configPath + "/bots/custom_bot.lua";

      // Use botFile to read or write configuration files'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a constant string and is thread-safe. The returned path
    may vary depending on the TrinityCore installation and server configuration. This
    method should be called during initialization phase when the server environment
    is fully set up.
