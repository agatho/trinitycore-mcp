  class: LFGMgr
  method: GetKicksLeft
  signature: uint8 LFGMgr::GetKicksLeft(int gguid)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of remaining kicks allowed for a specific LFG group.
  description: The GetKicksLeft method retrieves the count of how many more times
    a player can be kicked from a Looking For Group (LFG) instance before being banned
    from joining LFG groups for a set period. This mechanism prevents abuse of group
    finding systems by players who repeatedly leave or are removed from groups. The
    method takes a group GUID as input and returns a uint8 value representing the
    remaining kick attempts. If the returned value is zero, no further kicks are allowed
    for that group.
  parameters:
  - name: gguid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the LFG group to check kick
      limits for. This represents a specific group within the LFG system.
  returns: A uint8 value indicating how many more kicks are allowed for the specified
    LFG group. Returns 0 if no kicks remain, or if the group does not exist in the
    LFG manager.
  examples:
  - title: Check kick limit for a group
    code: "uint8 kicksLeft = sLFGMgr->GetKicksLeft(groupGuid);\nif (kicksLeft > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Allow kick\n    sLFGMgr->KickPlayerFromGroup(playerGuid, groupGuid);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot be kicked anymore\n    SendLFGDeniedMessage(\"\
      You have been kicked too many times.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG (Looking For Group) system in TrinityCore,
    which manages group creation, matching, and player behavior within dungeons and
    raids. The kick limit is typically configured via server settings or game rules
    to balance group stability with player flexibility.
  warnings: Ensure that gguid is a valid group GUID before calling this method; otherwise,
    the result may be undefined or incorrect. This method should not be used to enforce
    kick limits outside of LFG context as it's designed specifically for group management
    within the LFG framework.
