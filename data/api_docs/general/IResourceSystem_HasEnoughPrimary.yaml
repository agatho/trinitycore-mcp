documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has sufficient primary resources to meet a specified
    requirement.
  description: The HasEnoughPrimary method evaluates whether the current player entity
    possesses at least the specified amount of primary resources. This is commonly
    used in game mechanics such as spell casting, item crafting, or ability activation
    where resource costs must be validated before execution. The method performs a
    direct comparison against the player's current primary resource pool without modifying
    it. It returns true if the available resources are greater than or equal to the
    requested amount, and false otherwise. This check is typically performed before
    deducting resources from the player's inventory.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least the specified amount of primary
    resources; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (player->GetResourceSystem()->HasEnoughPrimary(100)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with resource-consuming action\n    player->ModifyPrimaryResource(-100);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Casting Validation
    code: "if (spell->GetManaCost() > 0 && !player->GetResourceSystem()->HasEnoughPrimary(spell->GetManaCost()))\
      \ {\n    SendCastResult(SPELL_FAILED_NO_POWER);\n    return false;\n}\n// Continue\
      \ with spell casting logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any side effects or modifications to the player's
    resource state. It is a read-only check that should be used in conjunction with
    resource deduction methods. The primary resource type being checked may vary depending
    on the implementation context, but typically refers to mana, energy, rage, or
    similar core gameplay resources.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is called before attempting to consume resources,
    as calling it after resource deduction without prior validation can lead to negative
    resource values. This check does not account for temporary modifiers or buffs
    that might affect resource availability.
