  class: LootCoordination
  method: OptimizeLootSequence
  signature: void LootCoordination::OptimizeLootSequence(Group * group, int & items)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the loot distribution sequence for a group based on item priorities
    and player participation.
  description: The OptimizeLootSequence method in the LootCoordination class adjusts
    the order of loot distribution within a group to ensure efficient and fair allocation
    of items. It analyzes the current state of the group's loot coordination, including
    player participation, item values, and distribution rules, to determine an optimal
    sequence that minimizes conflicts and maximizes satisfaction. This method is typically
    invoked during loot rolling or when new loot is added to the group's loot pool
    to re-evaluate and adjust the distribution order. The optimization considers factors
    such as player roles, loot preferences, and group dynamics to enhance overall
    loot fairness and reduce disputes.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group for which loot
      sequence is being optimized. Must not be null.
  - name: items
    description: Reference to an integer that tracks the number of items in the loot
      sequence. This value is updated by the method to reflect the current item count
      after optimization.
  returns: None. The method modifies the group's internal loot sequence state directly
    and updates the items count.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeLootSequence
    code: 'Group* group = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);

      int itemCount = 0;

      LootCoordination::OptimizeLootSequence(group, itemCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore loot system and
    may be called automatically during loot events. Developers should not typically
    invoke this method directly unless implementing custom loot coordination logic.
    The optimization process may involve multiple iterations and could have performance
    implications for large groups.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group object is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this function. The items parameter should be initialized to zero
    or a valid count before passing it to the method.
