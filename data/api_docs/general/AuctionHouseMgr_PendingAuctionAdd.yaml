  class: AuctionHouseMgr
  method: PendingAuctionAdd
  signature: bool AuctionHouseMgr::PendingAuctionAdd(const Player * player, uint32
    auctionHouseId, uint32 auctionId, uint64 deposit)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a pending auction to the auction house manager for processing.
  description: The PendingAuctionAdd method is responsible for registering a new auction
    with the auction house system. It takes in player information, auction house identifier,
    and auction details to prepare the auction for listing. This method typically
    acts as an intermediary step before the actual auction is finalized and added
    to the auction house database. The method returns true if the auction was successfully
    queued for processing, or false if there were issues such as invalid parameters
    or system errors. This functionality is crucial for maintaining the integrity
    of the auction system in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is creating
      the auction. Must not be null and must represent a valid online player.
  - name: auctionHouseId
    description: Unique identifier for the auction house where the auction will be
      listed. Valid values correspond to known auction house entries in the game database.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific auction being created. Must be
      a valid, unused auction ID within the system's range.
  - name: deposit
    description: The bid deposit amount in copper that the player must pay to place
      the auction. This value determines the minimum bid required and is used for
      auction mechanics.
  returns: Returns true if the auction was successfully queued for processing by the
    auction house manager, false otherwise. A return of false may indicate invalid
    parameters, insufficient funds, or system errors during the queuing process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Addition
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Valid player object\nuint32 auctionHouseId = 1;\n\
      uint32 auctionId = 1001;\nuint64 deposit = 50000; // 5 gold in copper\n\nbool\
      \ success = sAuctionHouseMgr->PendingAuctionAdd(player, auctionHouseId, auctionId,\
      \ deposit);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Auction queued successfully\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_AUCTION_ADD_SUCCESS);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to queue auction\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_AUCTION_ADD_FAILED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the auction house system when
    a player attempts to create an auction. The actual auction creation and database
    insertion may occur asynchronously after this method returns. Developers should
    ensure that all input parameters are validated before calling this method to prevent
    unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null player pointers can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the auctionHouseId and auctionId values are
    valid and within expected ranges. The deposit value must be properly calculated
    according to game rules to avoid inconsistencies in auction mechanics.
