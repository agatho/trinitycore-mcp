  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SetExtraScaleCurve
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetExtraScaleCurve(const int & points, int startTimeOffset,
    int interpolation)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the extra scale curve for an area trigger, defining how its visual scale
    changes over time.
  description: The SetExtraScaleCurve method configures the scaling behavior of an
    area trigger's visual effect over time. This allows developers to define a custom
    curve that controls how the area trigger expands or contracts during its duration.
    The method takes parameters that define the number of points in the curve, a start
    time offset, and an interpolation type to determine how the scale transitions
    between key points. This functionality is commonly used for creating dynamic visual
    effects such as expanding circles, growing explosions, or pulsating auras in World
    of Warcraft's spell and ability systems.
  parameters:
  - name: points
    description: The number of control points defining the scale curve. This determines
      how many keyframes are used to define the scaling behavior over time.
  - name: startTimeOffset
    description: Time offset in milliseconds from the start of the area trigger's
      duration when the scaling curve begins to take effect.
  - name: interpolation
    description: The interpolation method used between control points. Valid values
      typically include linear, quadratic, cubic, or other curve types that define
      how the scale transitions smoothly between keyframes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Area Trigger Scale Curve Setup
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);

      trigger->SetExtraScaleCurve(3, 0, 1); // 3 points, no offset, linear interpolation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Area Trigger with Delayed Scaling
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(67890);

      trigger->SetExtraScaleCurve(5, 1000, 2); // 5 points, 1 second delay, cubic
      interpolation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the visual representation of the area trigger and
    does not influence its hit detection or gameplay mechanics. The curve points are
    typically defined in a separate data structure or database entry. Developers should
    ensure that the interpolation type matches the intended visual effect, as different
    interpolation methods will produce varying smoothness and acceleration curves.
  warnings: Incorrect point counts or invalid interpolation types may cause undefined
    behavior or visual glitches. Setting a large number of points without proper optimization
    can impact performance. The startTimeOffset parameter must be carefully considered
    to avoid conflicts with other timed effects in the same area trigger.
