  signature: bool Map::GameObjectRespawnRelocation(GameObject * go, bool diffGridOnly)
documentation:
  brief: Relocates a game object to its respawn position if it has moved from its
    original grid.
  description: The GameObjectRespawnRelocation method is responsible for managing
    the positioning of game objects (such as doors, chests, or other interactive elements)
    within the World of Warcraft environment. It checks whether a given game object
    has been moved away from its original grid location and, if so, attempts to relocate
    it back to its respawn position. This functionality ensures that game objects
    maintain their intended placement in the world, especially after being interacted
    with or moved by players or other game mechanics. The method operates on a per-object
    basis and can optionally restrict relocation to only those objects that have crossed
    grid boundaries. It is typically invoked during map updates or when object states
    change to ensure consistency.
  parameters:
  - name: go
    description: A pointer to the GameObject instance that needs to be relocated.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid game object currently
      loaded on the map.
  - name: diffGridOnly
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether relocation should occur only for
      objects that have moved to a different grid. If true, only objects that have
      crossed grid boundaries will be relocated; if false, all eligible objects are
      processed regardless of grid status.
  returns: Returns true if the game object was successfully relocated to its respawn
    position, or if no relocation was needed. Returns false if the operation failed
    due to invalid state or other errors during the process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GameObjectRespawnRelocation
    code: "GameObject* go = ...; // Assume valid GameObject pointer\nbool result =\
      \ map->GameObjectRespawnRelocation(go, true);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Object\
      \ was relocated successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Relocating all objects without grid restriction
    code: "for (auto& go : map->GetGameObjectMap())\n{\n    map->GameObjectRespawnRelocation(go,\
      \ false);\n}\n// Relocates all game objects regardless of grid status"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core map management system and is crucial for
    maintaining object consistency in dynamic environments. It relies on internal
    tracking of original positions and grid boundaries to determine if relocation
    is necessary. Performance may be impacted when processing many objects, especially
    in large maps with numerous game objects.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null GameObject pointer as it will likely
    cause a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the GameObject passed is valid
    and loaded on the map before invoking this function. Also, calling this method
    frequently during active gameplay may introduce performance overhead.
