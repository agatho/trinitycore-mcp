  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::OnBotLogoutRequested(int guid, const std::string
    & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the logout request for a bot, processing cleanup and state changes.
  description: The OnBotLogoutRequested method is invoked when a bot player requests
    to log out from the game. This method is responsible for managing the necessary
    cleanup operations and updating internal state to reflect that the bot is no longer
    active. It typically handles tasks such as saving the bot's current state, releasing
    resources, and notifying other systems about the logout event. The method ensures
    proper handling of the bot's session termination while maintaining consistency
    in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot player requesting to log
      out. This value is used to locate and identify the specific bot instance within
      the system.
  - name: reason
    description: A string describing the reason for the logout request. This may be
      used for logging purposes or to determine special handling based on why the
      bot is logging out.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OnBotLogoutRequested
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::OnBotLogoutRequested(12345, "Player requested logout");
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling logout with different reasons
    code: "if (bot->IsInCombat()) {\n    BotLifecycleMgr::OnBotLogoutRequested(bot->GetGUID(),\
      \ \"Combat ended\");\n} else {\n    BotLifecycleMgr::OnBotLogoutRequested(bot->GetGUID(),\
      \ \"Scheduled logout\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a bot player initiates a logout sequence. It's important to ensure that all necessary
    cleanup operations are performed before this method returns, as further processing
    may depend on the completion of these tasks.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to resource leaks or inconsistent
    game state. Ensure that all associated resources are properly released and that
    no references to the bot remain after logout is processed.
