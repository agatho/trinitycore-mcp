  method: SendCorpseReclaimDelay
  signature: void Player::SendCorpseReclaimDelay(uint32 delay) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a corpse reclaim delay message to the player's client.
  description: This method sends a notification to the player's client indicating
    the delay before their corpse can be reclaimed by other players. The delay is
    typically set to 30 seconds after death, but can be adjusted based on game mechanics
    or player status. This method is used in conjunction with the corpse reclaim system
    to prevent immediate corpse looting and maintain game balance. It ensures that
    players cannot immediately loot another's corpse upon death.
  parameters:
  - name: delay
    description: The delay in seconds before a player's corpse can be reclaimed by
      others. Valid values are typically 30 seconds or higher, representing the time
      during which the corpse remains unlootable.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SendCorpseReclaimDelay(30);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nuint32 delay = 30;\nif (player->GetPlayer()->HasAura(12345))\n\
      \    delay = 60;\nplayer->SendCorpseReclaimDelay(delay);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player death or when a player's corpse
    becomes available for looting. It should be used in conjunction with other methods
    that handle corpse reclaim mechanics, such as SendCorpseReclaimDelay or related
    functions. The delay value is usually set to 30 seconds but can vary based on
    game rules.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly during player death unless specifically
    required by game mechanics. It's important to ensure that the delay is properly
    calculated and applied to avoid unintended consequences in corpse looting mechanics.
