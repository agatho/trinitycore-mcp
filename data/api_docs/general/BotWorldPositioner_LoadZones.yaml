  method: LoadZones
  signature: bool BotWorldPositioner::LoadZones()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes zone data for bot positioning calculations
  description: The LoadZones method initializes and loads all relevant zone information
    required for the BotWorldPositioner to accurately determine valid positions within
    game zones. This method typically reads zone-related data from the database or
    internal caches, setting up necessary structures for pathfinding and position
    validation. It ensures that bots can properly navigate and spawn within appropriate
    zones based on their assigned roles and the game world's geographical constraints.
    The method should be called during initialization or when zone data needs to be
    refreshed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the zone data was successfully loaded and initialized,
    false otherwise. A failure may occur due to database access issues, missing zone
    data, or internal initialization errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot initialization
    code: "BotWorldPositioner positioner;\nif (positioner.LoadZones()) {\n    // Zone\
      \ data loaded successfully\n    // Proceed with bot positioning logic\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle zone loading failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to load\
      \ zone data for bot positioning\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally expensive as it loads all zone data into
    memory. It's recommended to call this method once during system initialization
    rather than repeatedly. The method likely performs database queries and cache
    population which could impact performance if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling LoadZones without proper game context or database connectivity
    may result in incomplete or corrupted zone data, leading to incorrect bot positioning
    behavior. Ensure that the TrinityCore world server is properly initialized before
    invoking this method.
