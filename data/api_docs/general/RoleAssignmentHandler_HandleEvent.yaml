  method: HandleEvent
  signature: bool RoleAssignmentHandler::HandleEvent(const GroupEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles group events related to role assignment within a World
    of Warcraft instance
  description: The HandleEvent method is responsible for processing incoming group
    events that are relevant to role assignment in TrinityCore's group management
    system. This method typically receives a GroupEvent object containing information
    about changes in group composition, role distribution, or player status updates.
    It evaluates the event and performs necessary actions such as updating role assignments,
    notifying players, or adjusting group configurations. The method is part of the
    RoleAssignmentHandler class which manages how roles like tank, healer, and damage
    dealer are assigned and maintained within player groups.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A const reference to a GroupEvent object containing details about
      the group event that occurred. This includes information such as player joining/leaving,
      role changes, or group state modifications.
  returns: Returns true if the event was successfully processed and handled, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates an error in processing
    or an unsupported event type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Handling
    code: "RoleAssignmentHandler handler;\nGroupEvent event;\nevent.type = GroupEventType::PLAYER_JOINED;\n\
      event.playerGuid = 12345;\nbool result = handler.HandleEvent(event);\nif (result)\
      \ {\n    // Event processed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Assignment Update
    code: "RoleAssignmentHandler handler;\nGroupEvent event;\nevent.type = GroupEventType::ROLE_CHANGED;\n\
      event.playerGuid = 12345;\nevent.newRole = RoleType::TANK;\nbool result = handler.HandleEvent(event);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Player role updated to tank\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the group management subsystem when
    events occur. The implementation should be thread-safe as it may be invoked from
    different threads during concurrent group operations. Performance considerations
    include avoiding expensive operations within this method since it may be called
    frequently during active gameplay.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with invalid GroupEvent objects, as this
    could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the event data is properly
    initialized before passing it to this method.
