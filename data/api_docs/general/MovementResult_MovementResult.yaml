  brief: Initializes a new MovementResult object with default values
  description: The MovementResult constructor initializes a new instance of the MovementResult
    class, setting up internal state variables to their default values. This constructor
    is typically used when creating movement-related result objects within the TrinityCore
    server's movement handling system. The initialization ensures that all member
    variables are properly configured before being used in movement operations such
    as pathfinding, unit movement validation, or client response generation. This
    method does not require any parameters and prepares the object for subsequent
    method calls or data assignment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic MovementResult Construction
    code: 'MovementResult result;

      // Creates a new MovementResult object with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Movement Handler Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerMove(Player* player, const Position& dest)\n{\n    MovementResult\
      \ result;\n    // Use result for movement validation or response handling\n\
      \    if (result.IsValid())\n    {\n        // Process valid movement\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs minimal initialization and should be followed by
    appropriate method calls to populate the object with meaningful data. The MovementResult
    class is typically part of TrinityCore's internal movement system and may be used
    in conjunction with other movement-related classes such as MovementInfo, PathGenerator,
    or MovementHandler.
