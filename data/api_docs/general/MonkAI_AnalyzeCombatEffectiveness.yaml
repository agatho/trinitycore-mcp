  brief: Evaluates and updates the monk's combat effectiveness based on current target
    and ability states.
  description: The AnalyzeCombatEffectiveness method performs a comprehensive assessment
    of the monk's current combat situation, determining optimal abilities and actions
    to maximize damage output or survivability. It evaluates factors such as target
    health percentage, available energy resources, active buffs/debuffs, and cooldown
    states to inform decision-making for the AI controller. This method is typically
    invoked during combat updates to ensure the monk selects the most effective abilities
    based on real-time game state conditions.
