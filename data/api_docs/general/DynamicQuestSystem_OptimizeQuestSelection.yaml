  method: OptimizeQuestSelection
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::OptimizeQuestSelection(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes quest selection for a player bot by evaluating available quests
    and selecting the most beneficial ones based on dynamic criteria.
  description: The OptimizeQuestSelection method evaluates all available quests for
    a given player bot and determines the optimal sequence or selection of quests
    to maximize efficiency, reward accumulation, or other game-specific objectives.
    This method likely considers factors such as quest level requirements, available
    experience rewards, item rewards, quest completion time, and the bot's current
    inventory or character state. It is typically used in automated questing systems
    or AI-driven player bots to ensure that the bot makes intelligent decisions about
    which quests to pursue next. The method modifies the bot's quest selection behavior
    without directly modifying the player's quest log or state, focusing instead on
    optimizing the decision-making process for future quest engagement.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest selection
      will be optimized. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid
      player instance with active questing capabilities.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      DynamicQuestSystem::OptimizeQuestSelection(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Questing AI Loop
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    if (HasAvailableQuests())\n    {\n       \
      \ OptimizeQuestSelection(GetPlayer());\n        SelectNextQuest();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a dynamic questing system and may be called frequently
    during AI processing. It assumes that the player object passed in has valid quest
    data and is actively engaged in questing activities. The optimization algorithm
    likely prioritizes quests based on configurable weights such as experience per
    time unit, gold rewards, or quest chain progression.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is a valid Player instance before calling
    this method; passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. This method
    does not modify the actual quest log but affects internal quest selection logic,
    so it should be used carefully in systems where quest state integrity is critical.
