    * spellProto, uint32 damage, Unit * victim)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the critical healing bonus for a spell based on caster and spell
    information.
  description: This method computes the critical healing bonus applied to a spell's
    damage or healing output, considering the caster's critical strike chance and
    the spell's critical healing properties. It is used in the context of World of
    Warcraft's spell system to determine how much additional healing is applied when
    a spell critically hits. The method takes into account the caster's status, the
    spell's prototype information, and the damage amount to calculate the final bonus
    value.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit that is casting the spell; can be null if the
      spell is not cast by a unit.
  - name: spellProto
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure defining the spell being cast;
      represents the spell's properties and mechanics.
  - name: damage
    description: The base damage amount for which critical healing bonus is calculated;
      typically used to determine how much additional healing is added.
  - name: victim
    description: Pointer to the Unit receiving the healing; represents the target
      of the spell.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total critical healing bonus applied
    to the spell, which may be zero if no critical strike occurs or if the spell does
    not have critical healing properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 criticalBonus = unit->SpellCriticalHealingBonus(caster, spellProto,
      damage, victim);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other healing calculations
    and may be part of a larger healing system. It requires proper handling of the
    caster's status and spell properties to ensure accurate results.
  warnings: The method assumes that the caster and victim are valid units; invalid
    pointers can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Also, if the spellProto is
    null, it will result in an error condition.
