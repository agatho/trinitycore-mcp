  class: BotActionProcessor
  method: ExecuteAttackTarget
  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteAttackTarget(Player * bot,
    const BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an attack action on a specified target for a bot player.
  description: The ExecuteAttackTarget method processes and executes an attack command
    for a given bot player, targeting a specific enemy within range. This method is
    part of the TrinityCore AI system that governs bot behavior in World of Warcraft.
    It evaluates the bot's current state, checks if the target is valid and attackable,
    and then performs the necessary actions to initiate combat with the target. The
    method respects game mechanics such as line of sight, target validity, and bot
    combat settings.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the attack action. Must be a valid bot instance with proper AI configuration.
  - name: action
    description: Reference to a BotAction object containing the attack command details,
      including target information and any relevant parameters for the attack execution.
  returns: Returns a BotActionResult enum value indicating the outcome of the attack
    execution. Possible values include SUCCESS if the attack was initiated, FAILED
    if the action could not be completed due to invalid target or state, and other
    status codes depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Target Execution
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player\nBotAction action;\naction.type =\
      \ BotActionType::ATTACK;\naction.targetGuid = targetGuid;\nBotActionResult result\
      \ = processor.ExecuteAttackTarget(bot, action);\nif (result == BotActionResult::SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Attack initiated successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Attack Result
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nBotAction action;\naction.type = BotActionType::ATTACK;\n\
      action.targetGuid = targetGuid;\nBotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteAttackTarget(bot,\
      \ action);\nswitch (result) {\n    case BotActionResult::SUCCESS:\n        //\
      \ Attack started\n        break;\n    case BotActionResult::FAILED:\n      \
      \  // Could not attack - invalid target or state\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Other error conditions\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has been properly initialized with AI capabilities
    and that the target exists in the same map. The method may perform internal checks
    for combat readiness, target validity, and line of sight before attempting to
    attack. It is designed to be thread-safe as part of the core AI processing system.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player object passed is valid and represents an actual
    bot instance. Passing a null pointer or non-bot player will likely result in undefined
    behavior. Also, make sure the target GUID corresponds to a valid, attackable unit
    in the same map.
