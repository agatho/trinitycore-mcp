  signature: int EvokerAI::GetMaxEssence()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum essence value that the evoker can currently store
  description: The GetMaxEssence method retrieves the maximum amount of essence that
    an Evoker AI character can hold at any given time. This value is typically determined
    by the evoker's current level, gear, and any applicable buffs or debuffs. The
    returned integer represents the cap on essence accumulation, which affects how
    much essence can be generated through abilities like Essence Burst or other mechanics.
    This method is commonly used in AI decision-making to determine when to use essence-based
    abilities or when to conserve essence for higher-priority actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum essence capacity of the evoker. This
    value typically ranges from 0 to several hundred depending on the evoker's level
    and equipment. Returns 0 if the evoker is in an invalid state or has no essence
    capacity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int maxEssence = evokerAI->GetMaxEssence();\nif (maxEssence > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Proceed with essence-based logic\n    printf(\"Maximum essence: %d\\\
      n\", maxEssence);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Essence Management
    code: "int currentEssence = evokerAI->GetEssence();\nint maxEssence = evokerAI->GetMaxEssence();\n\
      \nif (currentEssence >= maxEssence)\n{\n    // Essence is at maximum, consider\
      \ using abilities that consume essence\n    evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_ESSENCE_BURST);\n\
      }\nelse if (currentEssence < maxEssence * 0.3f)\n{\n    // Low on essence, avoid\
      \ wasting it\n    evokerAI->DoNothing();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may return different values during combat versus non-combat states
    due to temporary buffs or debuffs. The returned value should be cached locally
    if used frequently within a single AI decision cycle to avoid unnecessary calls
    to the game engine.
  warnings: Do not assume that the maximum essence is static; it can change based
    on level-ups, gear changes, or temporary effects. Always verify the return value
    before making decisions that depend on essence capacity.
