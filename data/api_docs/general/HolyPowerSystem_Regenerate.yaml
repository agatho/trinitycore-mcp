  class: HolyPowerSystem
  method: Regenerate
  signature: void HolyPowerSystem::Regenerate(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Regenerates holy power for the player based on the specified parameter.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for restoring holy power to a
    player character within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically gets
    invoked during gameplay events such as combat ticks, periodic effects, or specific
    ability usage that should replenish holy power. The regeneration process is governed
    by internal game mechanics and may be influenced by buffs, talents, or class-specific
    abilities. It is designed to maintain balance in gameplay by ensuring players
    can sustain their holy power usage over time.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An unsigned 32-bit integer representing the regeneration amount or
      type of holy power to be regenerated. The exact meaning depends on implementation
      details, but typically corresponds to a fixed value or multiplier used in the
      calculation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Holy Power Regeneration
    code: 'HolyPowerSystem* system = player->GetHolyPowerSystem();

      system->Regenerate(10); // Regenerates 10 units of holy power'
    language: cpp
  - title: Regenerating Based on Combat Event
    code: "void OnCombatTick(Player* player)\n{\n    HolyPowerSystem* system = player->GetHolyPowerSystem();\n\
      \    if (player->IsInCombat())\n        system->Regenerate(5); // Regenerate\
      \ 5 holy power during combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the game engine or through event
    handlers rather than directly by external code. The regeneration logic may be
    affected by player state, such as being in combat or under certain buffs. Ensure
    that any calls to this method are synchronized with the game's timing mechanisms.
  warnings: Direct invocation of Regenerate without proper context may lead to unexpected
    behavior or imbalance in gameplay. Avoid calling this method outside of appropriate
    game events or tick handlers to prevent unintended power accumulation.
