documentation:
  brief: Sets the script loader callback function for dynamic script loading in TrinityCore.
  description: The SetScriptLoader method registers a callback function that will
    be invoked during the server initialization process to load scripts dynamically.
    This allows the TrinityCore server to integrate custom game logic, AI behaviors,
    or other scripted components at runtime. The registered callback is typically
    used by the scripting system to initialize and register various script objects
    such as AI scripts, event handlers, or custom game mechanics. This method should
    be called before the server begins loading its core systems to ensure proper script
    integration.
  parameters:
  - name: script_loader_callback
    description: A function pointer of type ScriptLoaderCallbackType that will be
      invoked during server initialization to load scripts. This callback typically
      registers script objects with the scripting system and should not perform heavy
      operations as it's called during startup.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Script Loader Registration
    code: "#include \"ScriptMgr.h\"\n\nvoid MyScriptLoader()\n{\n    // Register custom\
      \ AI scripts\n    // Register event handlers\n    // Initialize custom game\
      \ mechanics\n}\n\n// In server initialization code:\nScriptMgr::SetScriptLoader(&MyScriptLoader);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the TrinityCore server startup process,
    before any world objects are created. The script loader callback should be thread-safe
    and avoid blocking operations as it's invoked in a critical initialization path.
  warnings: Calling this method after server initialization may have unpredictable
    results or fail silently. Ensure that all script registration logic within the
    callback is robust and handles errors gracefully to prevent server startup failures.
