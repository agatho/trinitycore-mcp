documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LootItemStorage instance and releases all associated memory resources.
  description: The destructor for the LootItemStorage class is responsible for cleaning
    up all dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the loot item storage
    container. This includes freeing any memory occupied by stored loot items, clearing
    internal data structures, and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's World of
    Warcraft emulation, this destructor ensures proper cleanup of loot data that may
    have been accumulated during creature kills, quest rewards, or other game events
    involving item distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction via scope
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    LootItemStorage storage;\n    // ... populate\
      \ storage with loot items ...\n    // storage is automatically destroyed here\
      \ when function ends\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of heap-allocated instance
    code: 'LootItemStorage* storage = new LootItemStorage();

      // ... use storage ...

      delete storage; // Triggers destructor

      storage = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a LootItemStorage object goes
    out of scope or is deleted. It's important to note that this class likely manages
    resources that are critical for maintaining game state consistency, so improper
    destruction could lead to memory leaks or inconsistent loot data. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Developers should avoid manually calling destructors directly unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. Also, ensure that no other objects hold references
    to items within the storage before it is destroyed, as this could lead to dangling
    pointers or undefined behavior.
