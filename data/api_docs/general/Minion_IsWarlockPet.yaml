documentation:
  brief: Determines whether this minion is a warlock pet.
  description: The IsWarlockPet method checks if the current minion instance represents
    a warlock pet summoned by a player. This method is typically used in AI and game
    logic to differentiate between regular pets, guardian summons, and warlock-specific
    demonic minions. It returns true if the minion was summoned by a warlock class,
    false otherwise. The check relies on internal flags or creature template data
    that identifies the minion's summoner type.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the minion is a warlock pet (i.e., summoned by a warlock),
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a minion is a warlock pet
    code: "if (minion->IsWarlockPet()) {\n    // Handle warlock pet specific behavior\n\
      \    SendPetSpellInfo();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in AI decision making for warlock pets
    code: "class WarlockPetAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (me->GetCharmerOrOwner() && me->GetCharmerOrOwner()->IsPlayer())\
      \ {\n            if (auto minion = dynamic_cast<Minion*>(me)) {\n          \
      \      if (minion->IsWarlockPet()) {\n                    // Apply warlock pet\
      \ AI logic\n                    DoWarlockPetBehavior();\n                }\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the minion's summoner type being correctly identified
    as a warlock. It may not work properly if the minion was summoned through unconventional
    means or if the summoner information is corrupted.
  warnings: Ensure that the minion object is valid and initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing an uninitialized or invalid Minion instance could lead
    to undefined behavior.
