documentation:
  brief: Initializes and returns a ChatPacketSender for sending creature text messages
    in the specified locale.
  description: The operator() method of CreatureTextTextBuilder is responsible for
    constructing and returning a ChatPacketSender instance that can be used to send
    creature text messages to players. This method takes a LocaleConstant parameter
    to determine the language in which the text should be sent, ensuring proper localization
    of NPC dialogue. The returned ChatPacketSender is typically used within the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to handle creature communication
    with players. This method is part of the creature text system that allows NPCs
    to display localized messages, emotes, or sounds based on various triggers or
    events in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a ChatPacketSender object configured for sending creature
    text messages in the specified locale. The returned pointer may be null if the
    initialization fails or if the locale is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of CreatureTextTextBuilder
    code: "CreatureTextTextBuilder builder;\nLocaleConstant locale = LOCALE_en;\n\
      ChatPacketSender* sender = builder(locale);\nif (sender)\n{\n    // Use sender\
      \ to send creature text\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    processing creature text events. The ChatPacketSender returned should be used
    immediately and not stored for later use as it may be destroyed after sending.
    Ensure that the locale parameter is valid to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Do not attempt to use the returned ChatPacketSender pointer after the
    CreatureTextTextBuilder object has been destroyed or if the locale parameter is
    invalid. The method assumes proper initialization of the underlying text data
    structures and may return null in error conditions.
