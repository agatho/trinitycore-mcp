documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique identifier for bug reports within the support management
    system.
  description: The GenerateBugId method creates and returns a unique integer identifier
    that is used to track and manage bug reports submitted through the TrinityCore
    support system. This identifier is typically assigned when a new bug report is
    created and helps ensure that each report can be uniquely referenced throughout
    the system. The generated ID is usually sequential or based on a hash of relevant
    data to prevent collisions. This method does not require any input parameters
    and is designed to be called whenever a new bug entry needs to be initialized
    in the support database.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique identifier assigned to a newly
    created bug report. This ID should be used to reference the specific bug report
    in subsequent operations such as updates, queries, or resolution tracking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int bugId = sSupportMgr->GenerateBugId();

      // Use bugId to initialize a new bug report entry'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is likely thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded environment,
    but developers should verify that the underlying ID generation mechanism properly
    handles concurrent access. The generated IDs are typically stored in a database
    table alongside other bug report metadata.
