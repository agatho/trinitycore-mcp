  class: ThreatReference
  method: GetOnlineState
  signature: OnlineState ThreatReference::GetOnlineState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the online state of the threat reference target.
  description: The GetOnlineState method returns the current online status of the
    entity associated with this threat reference. This is typically used in AI and
    threat management systems to determine whether a target is currently connected
    to the game world or has logged out. The returned OnlineState enum indicates whether
    the target is online, offline, or in a transitional state. This method does not
    perform any network operations but rather checks an internal tracking mechanism
    maintained by the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: An OnlineState enumeration value indicating the current online status of
    the threat reference target. Possible values include ONLINE, OFFLINE, and potentially
    TRANSITIONING depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a target is online
    code: "ThreatReference threatRef;\nif (threatRef.GetOnlineState() == OnlineState::ONLINE)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with threat calculations\n    DoThreatCalculation(threatRef);\n\
      } else {\n    // Target is not currently online\n    Log(\"Target is offline,\
      \ skipping threat update.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a fast, local check of the target's online state without
    requiring network communication. It relies on internal tracking maintained by
    the server's session management system. The implementation may cache this value
    for performance reasons.
