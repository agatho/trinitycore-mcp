  class: ShadowPriestRefactored
  method: ShadowPriestRefactored
  signature: void ShadowPriestRefactored::ShadowPriestRefactored(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ShadowPriestRefactored AI class instance with the specified
    player bot.
  description: The ShadowPriestRefactored constructor initializes the AI behavior
    for a shadow priest bot. This method sets up internal state variables, configures
    spell priorities, and prepares the AI to handle combat decisions based on shadow
    priest mechanics. The constructor typically assigns the provided Player pointer
    to an internal member variable, allowing the AI to access player properties such
    as health, mana, and current target. It also initializes any necessary cooldown
    tracking or spell usage counters required for proper shadow priest gameplay logic.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the shadow priest bot that
      this AI will control. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* shadowPriest = ...; // Get reference to player

      ShadowPriestRefactored* ai = new ShadowPriestRefactored(shadowPriest);

      // AI is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    pointer must remain valid throughout the lifetime of the ShadowPriestRefactored
    object to prevent dangling pointer issues.
