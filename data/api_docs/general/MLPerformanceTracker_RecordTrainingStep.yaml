  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: RecordTrainingStep
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::RecordTrainingStep(uint32_t botGuid, float
    loss, float reward)
documentation:
  brief: Records a training step for an AI bot with associated loss and reward metrics.
  description: The RecordTrainingStep method logs performance data for a specific
    AI bot during machine learning training. It stores the bot's unique identifier
    (GUID), the loss value from the training iteration, and the reward obtained. This
    data is typically used for monitoring training progress, analyzing bot behavior,
    and optimizing AI decision-making algorithms within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method does not return any value and is designed to be called during active
    training sessions when performance metrics are available.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the AI bot for which training data
      is being recorded. This should correspond to a valid bot in the system's AI
      management structure.
  - name: loss
    description: The loss value from the current training iteration, representing
      how far the bot's predictions are from expected outcomes. Lower values indicate
      better performance.
  - name: reward
    description: The reward value obtained during the training step, reflecting the
      bot's success in completing tasks or achieving objectives within the game environment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: MLPerformanceTracker::Instance()->RecordTrainingStep(12345, 0.05f, 10.5f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Training Loop
    code: "void BotTrainingLoop() {\n    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {\n      \
      \  float loss = CalculateLoss();\n        float reward = CalculateReward();\n\
      \        MLPerformanceTracker::Instance()->RecordTrainingStep(botGuid, loss,\
      \ reward);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within AI training contexts and may
    be used in conjunction with other performance tracking mechanisms. The data recorded
    here is often persisted to database or memory structures for later analysis. Ensure
    that botGuid corresponds to an active bot, as invalid GUIDs might lead to data
    loss or errors in tracking systems.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid botGuid values may result in corrupted
    tracking data or system instability. Avoid calling this method from multiple threads
    without proper synchronization mechanisms. The loss and reward parameters should
    be within reasonable ranges for accurate performance analysis.
