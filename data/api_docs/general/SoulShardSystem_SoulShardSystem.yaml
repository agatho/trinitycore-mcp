documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the SoulShardSystem class for managing soul
    shard resources in the game.
  description: The SoulShardSystem constructor initializes a new instance of the SoulShardSystem
    class, which is responsible for handling soul shard mechanics within the TrinityCore
    framework. This system manages the collection, storage, and usage of soul shards
    for warlocks and other classes that utilize this resource. The initialization
    process sets up internal data structures and prepares the system to track soul
    shard counts, handle shard generation, and integrate with player actions such
    as spell casting or item usage. This constructor does not require any parameters
    and performs all necessary setup internally.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new SoulShardSystem instance
    code: 'SoulShardSystem shardSystem;

      // The system is now initialized and ready to manage soul shards'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new SoulShardSystem
    object. It performs no operations on existing data, so it's safe to call multiple
    times on the same instance. The system will automatically initialize default values
    for soul shard tracking and management.
