  class: LootStrategy
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool LootStrategy::IsActive(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the loot strategy is currently active for the specified
    bot AI.
  description: The IsActive method checks if a particular loot strategy is enabled
    and applicable for the given BotAI instance. This method evaluates internal state
    flags or conditions to determine whether the strategy should be considered active
    during loot evaluation processes. It typically returns true when the strategy
    is ready to influence loot distribution decisions, and false otherwise. The method
    does not modify any state but serves as a query interface to assess the current
    operational status of the loot strategy within the context of the AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the loot strategy is currently active for the specified
    bot AI; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a loot strategy is active before processing loot
    code: "if (lootStrategy->IsActive(botAI)) {\n    // Proceed with loot evaluation\
      \ using this strategy\n    lootStrategy->ProcessLoot(botAI);\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Skip loot processing or fall back to default behavior\n    botAI->GetBot()->GetLoot()->SetLootMode(LootMode::DEFAULT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in the context of bot AI decision-making loops
    where strategies need to be evaluated for applicability before being applied.
    It's expected that this method will be called frequently during gameplay, so performance
    should be considered when implementing custom logic.
