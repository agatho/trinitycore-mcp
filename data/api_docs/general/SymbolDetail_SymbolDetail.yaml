documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SymbolDetail object with default values.
  description: The SymbolDetail constructor initializes a new instance of the SymbolDetail
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the object with default values,
    preparing it for use in the TrinityCore framework. The constructor is typically
    called automatically when creating a new SymbolDetail object on the stack or heap.
    It ensures that all member variables are properly initialized before any other
    operations are performed on the object. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, this class likely represents some form of symbolic data structure
    used for game mechanics or scripting.

  - title: Basic SymbolDetail Construction
    code: 'SymbolDetail detail;

      // Creates a new SymbolDetail object with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor, meaning it takes no parameters. The constructor
    performs basic initialization of member variables to their default states. In
    TrinityCore, objects created with this constructor should be ready for immediate
    use in game systems without requiring additional setup.
