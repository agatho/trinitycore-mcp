  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: StartRealTimeMonitoring
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::StartRealTimeMonitoring()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates real-time performance monitoring for bot analytics within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The StartRealTimeMonitoring method begins collecting and tracking performance
    metrics for bot operations in real-time. This functionality is typically used
    by the BotPerformanceAnalytics class to monitor resource usage, response times,
    and other key indicators of bot behavior during active gameplay. The method initializes
    internal timers and data structures required for continuous monitoring without
    requiring manual intervention. It does not require any prior setup or configuration
    beyond the existence of a valid BotPerformanceAnalytics instance. Once invoked,
    this method will start recording performance data until explicitly stopped via
    a corresponding stop method.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.StartRealTimeMonitoring();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not block the calling
    thread. It may spawn background threads internally for monitoring purposes. The
    performance data collected is typically stored in memory and can be accessed through
    other methods of the BotPerformanceAnalytics class.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without stopping previous monitoring
    sessions may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that a matching
    StopRealTimeMonitoring call is made to properly clean up resources.
