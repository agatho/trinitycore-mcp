  class: AuctionBotConfig
  method: SetConfig
  signature: void AuctionBotConfig::SetConfig(AuctionBotConfigFloatValues index, float
    value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a float configuration value for the Auction Bot system by index.
  description: The SetConfig method allows developers or administrators to modify
    specific float-based configuration parameters within the AuctionBot system. This
    method takes an enumeration index that identifies which configuration setting
    to update and assigns it a new float value. The AuctionBotConfigFloatValues enum
    likely represents various adjustable parameters such as bid percentages, price
    multipliers, or time intervals. Changes made using this method are typically applied
    immediately to the running Auction Bot instance, affecting its behavior in real-time.
    This method is part of the core configuration management system for the Auction
    Bot addon/module within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: An enumeration value that specifies which float configuration parameter
      to modify. This index maps to a specific setting such as bid multiplier, price
      adjustment factor, or time-based parameters within the Auction Bot system.
  - name: value
    description: The new float value to assign to the specified configuration parameter.
      This value should be within acceptable ranges for the particular configuration
      setting being modified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Bid Multiplier
    code: AuctionBotConfig::SetConfig(AuctionBotConfigFloatValues::BID_MULTIPLIER,
      1.5f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Price Adjustment Factor
    code: AuctionBotConfig::SetConfig(AuctionBotConfigFloatValues::PRICE_ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR,
      0.95f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on a global configuration cache that may require
    synchronization or persistence to disk depending on the implementation. The index
    parameter should be validated against known enum values to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Modifying configuration values at runtime without proper validation may
    cause unexpected auction behaviors or system instability. Ensure that float values
    are within expected ranges for each configuration parameter.
