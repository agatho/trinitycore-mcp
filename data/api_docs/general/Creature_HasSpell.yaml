  brief: Checks if the creature has a specific spell in its spell list
  description: The HasSpell method determines whether a creature possesses a particular
    spell in its database spell list. This is commonly used for checking if a creature
    has a specific spell available for use, such as during NPC dialog or when a player
    interacts with the creature. The method returns true if the spell exists in the
    creature's spell list, false otherwise. It is often used in conjunction with other
    spell-related methods to manage creature behavior and interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature has the specified spell in its spell list,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the spell is available for use by the
    creature.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->HasSpell(12345))\n{\n    // Creature has this spell\n   \
      \ // Perform action\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Creature does not have this spell\n\
      \    // Perform alternative action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks against the creature's database spell list,
    which includes spells that are part of its behavior or AI. Performance considerations
    include checking against a large number of spells in the creature's list, though
    this is generally minimal as most creatures have only a few specific spells.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with spells that may be dynamically
    added or removed from creature spell lists during runtime, as the result may not
    reflect current state if the creature's spell list changes.
