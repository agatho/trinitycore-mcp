  class: EssenceResource
  method: ConsumeEssence
  signature: void EssenceResource::ConsumeEssence(uint8 charges)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified number of essence charges from the resource.
  description: The ConsumeEssence method reduces the current charge count of an EssenceResource
    by the provided amount. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's spell
    and ability systems where certain powers or abilities require consuming essence
    as part of their usage. The method does not validate whether sufficient charges
    are available before consumption, so it's expected that callers ensure there are
    enough charges prior to invoking this function. If the charge count drops below
    zero, the behavior is undefined and may result in negative values or unexpected
    game state.
  parameters:
  - name: charges
    description: The number of essence charges to consume from the resource. Must
      be a non-negative integer value representing the quantity of charges to deduct.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Essence Consumption
    code: 'EssenceResource resource;

      resource.SetCharges(10);

      resource.ConsumeEssence(3); // Consumes 3 charges, leaving 7'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming All Charges
    code: 'EssenceResource resource;

      resource.SetCharges(5);

      resource.ConsumeEssence(5); // Consumes all 5 charges, leaving 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal charge count of the EssenceResource.
    It is recommended to check available charges before calling this method to prevent
    unintended negative values. The implementation assumes that the resource has been
    properly initialized and that the charge count is managed correctly elsewhere
    in the system.
  warnings: Calling this method with a charge value greater than the current resource's
    charge count may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect game state. Ensure proper
    validation is performed before invoking this function.
