  class: BotAIDecisionProfile
  method: BotAIDecisionProfile
  signature: void BotAIDecisionProfile::BotAIDecisionProfile(uint32_t guid, uint8_t
    cls, uint8_t lvl, uint8_t spec)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new bot AI decision profile with specified GUID, class, level,
    and specialization.
  description: The BotAIDecisionProfile constructor initializes a new instance of
    the bot AI decision profile using the provided parameters. This method sets up
    internal data structures that define how a bot will make decisions based on its
    character's attributes such as class, level, and specialization. The GUID identifies
    the specific bot instance, while cls, lvl, and spec determine the bot's behavior
    patterns and decision-making logic within the TrinityCore framework. This initialization
    is crucial for proper AI operation in scripted bot systems.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character. Must be a valid, non-zero
      value that uniquely identifies this specific bot instance within the game world.
  - name: cls
    description: Class identifier of the bot character. Represents the player class
      (e.g., Warrior=1, Paladin=2, etc.) according to TrinityCore's class enumeration
      system.
  - name: lvl
    description: Level of the bot character. Must be a valid level between 1 and maximum
      allowed level in the current game version (typically 80 for retail).
  - name: spec
    description: Specialization identifier of the bot character. Indicates which talent
      specialization the bot is using, with values typically ranging from 0 to 2 depending
      on class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot AI Profile Initialization
    code: 'BotAIDecisionProfile profile(123456, CLASS_WARRIOR, 70, 0);

      // Creates a new bot AI decision profile for a level 70 Warrior with no specialization'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing a Mage Bot Profile
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = sObjectMgr->GetNextTemporarySpawnId();

      BotAIDecisionProfile mageProfile(botGuid, CLASS_MAGE, 60, 2);

      // Creates a new bot AI profile for a level 60 Frost Mage with Frost specialization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during bot creation or when reinitializing
    an existing bot's AI behavior. The parameters are stored internally and used to
    determine decision-making priorities, spell selection, and combat strategies.
    Performance is generally not a concern for this constructor as it performs simple
    data assignment operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter is unique among all active bots in the
    system to prevent conflicts. Invalid class values may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect AI decisions. The level should be within valid game range, otherwise
    bot behavior may become unpredictable.
