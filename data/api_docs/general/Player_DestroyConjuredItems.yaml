documentation:
  brief: Destroys all conjured items owned by the player.
  description: The DestroyConjuredItems method removes all items that were created
    through conjuration effects (such as those from spells like Conjure Food or Conjure
    Water) from the player's inventory. This method is typically invoked when a player
    logs out, changes zones, or when conjured items are no longer valid due to game
    state changes. The optional 'update' parameter controls whether the client is
    notified of the item removal. If update is true, the client will receive an update
    packet to reflect the changes in the inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: update
    description: Controls whether to send an update packet to the client. When true,
      the client's inventory UI will be refreshed to reflect removed conjured items.
      When false, only internal state is updated without notifying the client.
  returns: null
