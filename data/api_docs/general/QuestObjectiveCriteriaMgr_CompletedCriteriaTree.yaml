  class: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  method: CompletedCriteriaTree
  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::CompletedCriteriaTree(const int * tree,
    int * referencePlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and completes a criteria tree for a quest objective, updating player
    progress.
  description: The CompletedCriteriaTree method is responsible for handling the completion
    of a criteria tree associated with a quest objective. It takes an array of integers
    representing the criteria tree structure and updates the player's progress accordingly.
    This method is typically invoked when a player fulfills all requirements within
    a specific quest objective that uses a criteria tree for tracking progress. The
    method modifies internal state to reflect completed objectives and may trigger
    related events or updates in the player's quest log. It operates on the provided
    reference player data, ensuring that progress is correctly attributed to the appropriate
    player character.
  parameters:
  - name: tree
    description: Pointer to an array of integers representing the criteria tree structure.
      Each element corresponds to a specific criteria node in the quest objective
      progression.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to an integer array or data structure that references the
      player's current progress and state. Used to update the player's quest completion
      status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int criteriaTree[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};

      int playerData[] = {0, 0, 0, 0};

      questObjectiveCriteriaMgr->CompletedCriteriaTree(criteriaTree, playerData);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Player Context
    code: 'const int* tree = GetQuestCriteriaTree(12345);

      Player* player = session->GetPlayer();

      int playerRef[PLAYER_MAX_QUEST_LOG_SIZE];

      FillPlayerReferenceData(player, playerRef);

      questObjectiveCriteriaMgr->CompletedCriteriaTree(tree, playerRef);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the quest system when a player
    completes all criteria within a quest objective. The tree parameter should contain
    valid criteria node identifiers that correspond to existing quest objectives in
    the database. The referencePlayer parameter must point to a valid data structure
    containing player progress information.
  warnings: Improperly formatted or invalid criteria tree arrays may cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all referenced criteria nodes exist in the database
    before calling this method. Do not call this method directly with unvalidated
    input data without proper bounds checking.
