documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an array of item IDs associated with a specified reward pack ID
    from the DB2 database.
  description: The GetRewardPackItemsByRewardID method fetches a list of item identifiers
    (IDs) that are linked to a specific reward pack within the TrinityCore database.
    This functionality is commonly used in World of Warcraft content to determine
    what items a player will receive when claiming a particular reward pack, such
    as those from quest rewards or achievement-based loot systems. The method accesses
    internal DB2 data structures and returns a pointer to an array of integers representing
    item IDs. It's important to note that the returned pointer is managed internally
    and should not be freed by the caller. The method assumes that the rewardPackID
    provided corresponds to a valid entry in the database; otherwise, it may return
    a null or empty result.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointing to an array of item IDs associated with the given
    reward pack ID. If no items are found for the specified reward pack, or if the
    rewardPackID is invalid, the method may return nullptr or an empty array depending
    on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Items from a Reward Pack
    code: "uint32 rewardPackId = 12345;\nconst int* items = sDB2Manager->GetRewardPackItemsByRewardID(rewardPackId);\n\
      if (items != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; items[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n \
      \       printf(\"Item ID: %d\\n\", items[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on DB2 data tables which are loaded at server startup.
    Ensure that the DB2 files are properly configured and loaded before calling this
    method. The returned array is not dynamically allocated, so it should not be freed
    by the caller. The method does not perform bounds checking on the returned array,
    so callers must ensure safe access to avoid buffer overruns.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid rewardPackID may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. Always validate input parameters before invoking
    the method. Be cautious when iterating through the returned array; ensure that
    the end of the list is properly detected (typically by checking for a zero value
    or using a known length).
