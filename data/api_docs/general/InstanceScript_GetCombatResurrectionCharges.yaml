  class: InstanceScript
  method: GetCombatResurrectionCharges
  signature: uint8 InstanceScript::GetCombatResurrectionCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of combat resurrection charges available in
    the instance.
  description: The GetCombatResurrectionCharges method returns the count of combat
    resurrection charges that are currently available for use within the instance.
    These charges typically represent temporary abilities or items that allow players
    to resurrect themselves or others during combat, often limited by cooldowns or
    usage restrictions. The value returned is usually used to determine whether a
    player can perform a combat resurrection at the current time. This method is commonly
    utilized in instance scripts to manage game mechanics related to player survival
    and resurrection within dungeon or raid environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the number of available combat resurrection
    charges. A return value of 0 indicates no charges are currently available, while
    higher values indicate the number of usable charges remaining.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Combat Resurrection Charges
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::HandlePlayerDeath(Player* player)\n{\n    uint8\
      \ charges = GetCombatResurrectionCharges();\n    if (charges > 0)\n    {\n \
      \       // Allow combat resurrection\n        player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_COMBAT_RESURRECTION,\
      \ true);\n        // Decrease charge count\n        --m_combatResurrectionCharges;\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // No charges available, proceed with normal\
      \ death mechanics\n        player->KillPlayer();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger combat resurrection system that
    may include cooldown tracking, charge regeneration, or usage limits. The implementation
    likely depends on instance-specific rules and may be influenced by player actions
    or events within the dungeon or raid.
  warnings: Ensure proper synchronization when accessing this value in multi-threaded
    contexts, as combat resurrection charges might be modified concurrently by different
    game systems. Also, be cautious not to assume a fixed number of charges; always
    check the return value before attempting to use them.
