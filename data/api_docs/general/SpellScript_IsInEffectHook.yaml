  class: SpellScript
  method: IsInEffectHook
  signature: bool SpellScript::IsInEffectHook() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current spell script execution is within an effect
    hook context.
  description: The IsInEffectHook method checks if the current execution context of
    a SpellScript is inside an effect hook, which occurs when a spell effect is being
    processed. This is particularly useful for conditional logic that should only
    execute during specific phases of spell processing, such as when applying or removing
    aura effects. The method returns true if the script is currently executing within
    an effect handler, and false otherwise. This can be used to prevent certain operations
    from occurring at inappropriate times during spell lifecycle events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current SpellScript execution context is inside an
    effect hook (i.e., during spell effect application/removal), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell effect handler
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleEffect(SpellEffIndex\
      \ effIndex) override\n    {\n        if (IsInEffectHook())\n        {\n    \
      \        // Only execute this logic when within an effect hook context\n   \
      \         // e.g., modifying target stats during aura application\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in custom spell scripts to determine the execution
    context. It's important to note that the return value may change depending on
    where in the spell lifecycle the script is currently executing. The method should
    only be called from within SpellScript methods that are part of the spell effect
    handling chain.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for critical logic flow decisions without understanding
    the full spell execution context. Incorrect usage might lead to unexpected behavior
    during spell processing, especially when dealing with complex multi-effect spells
    or chained effects.
