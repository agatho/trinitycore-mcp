documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the group coordinator system is enabled
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the group coordinator functionality
    is currently active within the TrinityCore instance. This system manages group-related
    operations such as loot distribution, role assignments, and coordination between
    group members. The method returns a boolean value indicating the operational status
    of the group coordinator subsystem. This check is typically performed before attempting
    to use group coordination features to avoid errors or unexpected behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group coordinator system is enabled and functional;
    otherwise returns false if the system is disabled or not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (groupCoordinator.IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with group coordination\
      \ operations\n    groupCoordinator.AssignRoles();\n} else {\n    // Fallback\
      \ behavior when coordinator is disabled\n    SendErrorMessage(\"Group coordination\
      \ is not available\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple boolean check against an internal flag and
    has minimal performance impact. It's recommended to cache this value if checking
    frequently in performance-critical sections of code.
