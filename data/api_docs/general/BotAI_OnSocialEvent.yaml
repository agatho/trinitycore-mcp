  brief: Handles social events for bot AI characters in the game world
  description: The OnSocialEvent method processes and responds to various social interactions
    and events that occur within the World of Warcraft environment for bot AI instances.
    This method is invoked when a bot encounters social triggers such as greetings,
    emotes, or other player interactions, allowing the AI to react appropriately based
    on its configured behavior patterns. The method integrates with TrinityCore's
    social system to ensure bots maintain realistic and contextually appropriate responses
    during player encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Social Event Handling
    code: "void BotAI::OnSocialEvent(const SocialEvent& event)\n{\n    switch (event.GetType())\n\
      \    {\n        case SOCIAL_EVENT_GREET:\n            // Respond to player greeting\n\
      \            SendChatMessage(\"Hello there!\");\n            break;\n      \
      \  case SOCIAL_EVENT_EMOTE:\n            // React to emote events\n        \
      \    HandleEmoteResponse(event.GetEmoteId());\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            break;\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically called by the core game loop when social events
    are detected for bot characters. Developers should ensure that any custom implementations
    properly handle different social event types and maintain thread safety when accessing
    shared AI state data.
  warnings: Improper handling of social events may cause bots to behave unnaturally
    or crash the game. Always validate event data before processing and avoid blocking
    operations within this method as it's called frequently during gameplay.
