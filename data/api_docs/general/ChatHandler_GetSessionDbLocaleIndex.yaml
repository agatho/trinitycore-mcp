documentation:
  brief: Returns the database locale index associated with the current session's player.
  description: The GetSessionDbLocaleIndex method retrieves the numeric locale identifier
    (LocaleConstant) that corresponds to the language settings of the player currently
    associated with this chat handler's session. This value determines which localized
    strings and data should be served from the database for the player. The method
    is typically used in commands or functions that need to respect the player's language
    preference when retrieving or displaying localized content. It does not validate
    whether the locale is valid or active, but rather returns whatever locale was
    set during the session initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LocaleConstant enum value representing the database locale index for
    the current session's player. This value typically maps to a specific language
    (e.g., LOCALE_en, LOCALE_fr, etc.) used for localization purposes in the TrinityCore
    database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log the session's locale
    code: "void MyCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    LocaleConstant locale = handler->GetSessionDbLocaleIndex();\n\
      \    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Current session locale index: %u\", locale);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a valid session exists and that the player's locale
    has been properly initialized. The returned LocaleConstant value is typically
    set during login based on the client's language settings or server configuration.
