api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: CalculateVendorPricing
  signature: void VendorInteraction::CalculateVendorPricing(uint32 vendorGuid, VendorAnalysis
    & analysis)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates vendor pricing for a given vendor GUID and stores the analysis
    results in the provided VendorAnalysis structure.
  description: The CalculateVendorPricing method processes vendor item pricing logic
    for a specified vendor identified by its GUID. It analyzes the vendor's item offerings,
    applies relevant game mechanics such as faction modifiers, reputation levels,
    and vendor-specific pricing adjustments. The method populates the provided VendorAnalysis
    parameter with detailed pricing information including base prices, adjusted prices,
    and any applicable discounts or surcharges. This functionality is typically used
    during vendor interaction events to determine final item costs presented to players.
  parameters:
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor NPC whose pricing will
      be calculated. Must correspond to a valid NPC in the game world.
  - name: analysis
    description: Reference to a VendorAnalysis structure that will store the calculated
      pricing data and analysis results for the vendor's items.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Pricing Calculation
    code: 'uint32 vendorGuid = 12345;

      VendorAnalysis analysis;

      VendorInteraction::CalculateVendorPricing(vendorGuid, analysis);

      // The analysis structure now contains pricing information for the vendor''s
      items'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Calculated Pricing in Vendor Interaction
    code: "void HandleVendorInteraction(Player* player, uint32 vendorGuid)\n{\n  \
      \  VendorAnalysis analysis;\n    VendorInteraction::CalculateVendorPricing(vendorGuid,\
      \ analysis);\n    \n    for (auto& item : analysis.items)\n    {\n        uint32\
      \ finalPrice = item.adjustedPrice;\n        // Process item purchase logic\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the vendor's item database, reputation
    systems, and faction-specific pricing rules. The VendorAnalysis structure may
    contain additional metadata beyond just pricing such as item availability status
    or special discounts. Performance-wise, this method should be called sparingly
    during vendor interactions to avoid excessive processing overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the vendorGuid parameter references a valid NPC in the game
    world; invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or crashes. The VendorAnalysis
    structure must be properly initialized before calling this method to prevent memory
    corruption issues.
