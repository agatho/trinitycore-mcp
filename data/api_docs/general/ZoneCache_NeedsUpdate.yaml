  method: NeedsUpdate
  signature: bool ZoneCache::NeedsUpdate(uint32 currentTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the zone cache requires an update based on the current
    time.
  description: The NeedsUpdate method checks if the zone cache data has expired and
    needs to be refreshed. It compares the current time against the last update timestamp
    of the zone cache to determine if a new update cycle should begin. This method
    is typically used in game loop logic to manage when zone-related data should be
    recalculated or reloaded. The method does not perform the actual update, but rather
    evaluates whether one is needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the zone cache needs to be updated based on the current
    time; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "if (zoneCache.NeedsUpdate(getCurrentTime())) {\n    zoneCache.Update();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's world update cycle to manage
    zone data refresh rates. The time-based check helps balance performance with data
    freshness, preventing unnecessary frequent updates while ensuring that stale data
    doesn't persist too long.
