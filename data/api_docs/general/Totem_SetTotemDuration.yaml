  class: Totem
  method: SetTotemDuration
  signature: void Totem::SetTotemDuration(int duration)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the duration of the totem in seconds
  description: The SetTotemDuration method configures the time remaining before a
    totem expires. This method directly modifies the internal duration timer of the
    totem object, affecting when it will be automatically removed from the game world.
    The duration is typically set based on spell effects or player actions, and controls
    how long the totem remains active. When the duration reaches zero, the totem is
    destroyed and removed from the world.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The new duration value in seconds for the totem. Must be a non-negative
      integer. Values of zero or less will typically result in immediate removal of
      the totem.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Totem Duration to 30 Seconds
    code: "Totem* totem = player->GetTotem(TOTEM_SLOT_FIRE);\nif (totem)\n{\n    totem->SetTotemDuration(30);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Extend Totem Duration Based on Spell Effect
    code: 'int newDuration = 60 + spellEffect->GetMiscValue(); // Base 60 seconds
      plus bonus

      player->GetTotem(TOTEM_SLOT_EARTH)->SetTotemDuration(newDuration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate the input duration against game limits or spell
    restrictions. It directly sets the internal timer value without triggering any
    additional events or checks. The totem's visual effects and gameplay behavior
    are typically handled by other systems, with this method only controlling the
    expiration timing.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative or zero value will likely cause the
    totem to be removed immediately from the game world. This can lead to unexpected
    behavior if not properly coordinated with other systems that depend on the totem's
    existence. Ensure proper validation of duration values before calling this method.
