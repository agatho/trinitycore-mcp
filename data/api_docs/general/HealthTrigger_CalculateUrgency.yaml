documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the urgency level of a health trigger for bot AI decision
    making.
  description: The CalculateUrgency method evaluates the current health state of a
    bot and determines how urgent it is to address health-related actions. This method
    is typically used within the TrinityCore's BotAI system to prioritize health-based
    behaviors such as seeking healing, avoiding damage, or using health potions. The
    urgency value is derived from comparing the bot's current health percentage against
    predefined thresholds, with higher values indicating more critical health conditions
    that require immediate attention. The method takes into account the AI context
    provided by the BotAI parameter to ensure accurate assessment based on the bot's
    current situation and available resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the urgency level of the health trigger, typically
    ranging from 0.0 (no urgency) to 1.0 (critical urgency). Values closer to 1.0
    indicate that immediate health action is required.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Context
    code: "float urgency = trigger->CalculateUrgency(ai);\nif (urgency > 0.7f) {\n\
      \    // Execute high-priority healing behavior\n    ai->DoHeal();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during AI decision-making
    cycles, so performance is important. The calculation should avoid heavy operations
    or database lookups. The method assumes that the BotAI parameter provides valid
    context about the bot's current state.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as accessing invalid AI context may lead to undefined behavior. The urgency values
    are relative and should be compared against appropriate thresholds within the
    calling code.
