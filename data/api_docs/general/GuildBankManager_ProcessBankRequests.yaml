  signature: void GuildBankManager::ProcessBankRequests()
documentation:
  brief: Processes pending guild bank requests and updates the bank state accordingly.
  description: The ProcessBankRequests method handles all queued guild bank transactions
    and operations, ensuring that pending actions such as item deposits, withdrawals,
    and transfers are properly executed. This method is typically invoked during game
    loop processing to maintain synchronization between the in-game guild bank and
    the database. It manages request queues, validates transaction permissions, and
    updates relevant player and guild data structures. The method ensures that all
    guild bank activities are processed in a timely manner and maintains consistency
    across the guild's banking system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    sGuildBankMgr->ProcessBankRequests();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from the main game thread to ensure thread
    safety. It performs database operations and may cause performance overhead if
    there are many pending requests. The method is designed to be lightweight but
    can block briefly during database synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the main game loop may result in race conditions
    or inconsistent state. Do not invoke it from multiple threads simultaneously without
    proper synchronization mechanisms.
