  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: AdaptToComposition
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::AdaptToComposition()
documentation:
  brief: Adapts AI behavior based on current composition of nearby units and environmental
    factors.
  description: The AdaptToComposition method dynamically adjusts the behavior of an
    AI entity according to the current group composition, including the presence and
    types of friendly and hostile units in the vicinity. This method evaluates various
    factors such as unit count, class distribution, health status, and proximity to
    modify the AI's decision-making process. It is typically invoked during combat
    or strategic phases where situational awareness is crucial for optimal performance.
    The behavior adaptation may include changes in targeting priority, spell selection,
    movement patterns, or tactical positioning.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n    m_adaptiveManager.AdaptToComposition();\n\
      \    // ... continue with adapted behavior ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during AI update cycles.
    It performs lightweight composition analysis without blocking the main thread,
    making it suitable for real-time tactical adjustments. The internal logic may
    cache certain values for performance but will refresh when significant changes
    occur in the unit composition.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called excessively within a short time
    frame as it might lead to unnecessary recalculations. Avoid calling this method
    during critical sections where AI state transitions are already in progress.
