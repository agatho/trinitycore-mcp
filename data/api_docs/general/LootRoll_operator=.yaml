documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a LootRoll object to another LootRoll object.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources from the source
    LootRoll object (other) to the current object. This operation leaves the source
    object in a valid but unspecified state, typically with empty or reset internal
    data. The method is used primarily for efficient resource management when transferring
    ownership of loot roll data between objects without unnecessary copying. In the
    context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this is commonly used during
    loot processing and cleanup operations where temporary or intermediate LootRoll
    instances need to be efficiently moved rather than copied.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current LootRoll object after the move assignment has
    been completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'LootRoll roll1;

      LootRoll roll2 = std::move(roll1); // Uses move assignment

      // roll1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'LootRoll roll1, roll2, roll3;

      roll1 = std::move(roll2); // Move roll2 to roll1

      roll1 = std::move(roll3); // Move roll3 to roll1

      // Both roll2 and roll3 are now in valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation, which is more efficient than copy
    assignment as it transfers ownership of resources rather than copying them. The
    source object after move assignment should not be used in any way that requires
    its previous state to remain valid. This method is typically auto-generated by
    the compiler for classes that manage resources, but may be explicitly defined
    for performance optimization or custom behavior.
  warnings: After a move assignment, the source object should not be accessed or used
    in any way that assumes it contains valid data. The object will be left in a valid
    but unspecified state, and using it could lead to undefined behavior or unexpected
    results.
