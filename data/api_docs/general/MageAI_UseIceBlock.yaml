  class: MageAI
  method: UseIceBlock
  signature: void MageAI::UseIceBlock()
documentation:
  brief: Activates the Mage's Ice Block ability to prevent all damage and interrupts
    for a short duration.
  description: The UseIceBlock method triggers the Mage's Ice Block spell, which provides
    a protective barrier that makes the mage immune to all damage and spell interruption
    effects for a specified time. This ability is typically used as a defensive mechanism
    during combat when the Mage needs to avoid taking damage or prevent enemy spells
    from interrupting ongoing casts. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    no return value operations, directly initiating the spell's effect on the caster.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Logic
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->HasAura(SPELL_ICE_BLOCK))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Use Ice Block when health drops below 20%\n \
      \   if (me->GetHealthPct() < 20.0f)\n        UseIceBlock();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the MageAI class during combat
    decision making, and should only be invoked when the spell is not on cooldown
    or already active. The Ice Block ability has a significant cooldown period in
    World of Warcraft, so frequent use will result in the spell being unavailable.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking for existing Ice Block effects or
    spell cooldowns may result in unintended behavior or failed spell activation.
    Ensure that the Mage has sufficient mana and that the spell is not already active
    before invoking this method.
