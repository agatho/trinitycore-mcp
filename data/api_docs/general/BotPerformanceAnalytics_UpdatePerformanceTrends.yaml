api:
  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: UpdatePerformanceTrends
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::UpdatePerformanceTrends(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Updates performance trends for a specified bot by analyzing its behavior
    and resource usage patterns.
  description: The UpdatePerformanceTrends method is responsible for collecting and
    processing performance data related to a specific bot identified by its GUID.
    This method analyzes various metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, response
    times, and task completion rates to generate trend data that can be used for optimization
    or reporting purposes. The method typically runs periodically or in response to
    significant events within the bot's lifecycle. It updates internal analytics structures
    with new data points while maintaining historical context for trend analysis.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining efficient bot operations and identifying
    potential performance bottlenecks.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose performance trends
      are to be updated. This value must correspond to an existing bot instance in
      the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      analytics.UpdatePerformanceTrends(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic Performance Update
    code: "void UpdateAllBots()\n{\n    for (auto& bot : GetActiveBots())\n    {\n\
      \        BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\n        analytics.UpdatePerformanceTrends(bot.GetGUID());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database operations to persist performance metrics.
    It should be called with appropriate frequency to maintain accurate trend data
    without overloading system resources. The method assumes that the bot identified
    by botGuid is currently active and exists in the system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the bot exists before calling this
    method. Frequent calls to this method without proper throttling can impact performance.
