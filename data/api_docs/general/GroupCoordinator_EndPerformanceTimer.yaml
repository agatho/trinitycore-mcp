  signature: void GroupCoordinator::EndPerformanceTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Stops the performance timer and records the elapsed time for group coordination
    operations.
  description: The EndPerformanceTimer method terminates a previously started performance
    measurement cycle within the GroupCoordinator class. This method is typically
    used to track execution times of group-related operations such as member management,
    loot distribution, or quest progression. It calculates the duration since the
    timer was initiated and stores this data for potential logging, debugging, or
    performance analysis purposes. The method does not require any parameters and
    has no return value. It assumes that a corresponding StartPerformanceTimer call
    has been made beforehand to initialize the timing mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Coordination
    code: 'GroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.StartPerformanceTimer();

      // Perform group operations here

      coordinator.EndPerformanceTimer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a successful StartPerformanceTimer()
    invocation. The timer data is typically stored internally and may be accessed
    via other methods for reporting or analysis. Ensure that performance timing is
    enabled in the TrinityCore configuration for accurate measurements.
  warnings: Calling this method without a prior StartPerformanceTimer() may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect timing data. This method does not perform any
    validation on whether the timer was actually started, so developers must ensure
    proper usage order.
