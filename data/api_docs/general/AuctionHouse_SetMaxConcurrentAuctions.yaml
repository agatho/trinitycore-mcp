api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: SetMaxConcurrentAuctions
  signature: void AuctionHouse::SetMaxConcurrentAuctions(uint32 playerGuid, uint32
    maxAuctions)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of concurrent auctions a player can post in the auction
    house.
  description: The SetMaxConcurrentAuctions method configures the limit on how many
    auctions a specific player can have active at the same time within the auction
    house system. This setting is typically used to manage server resources and prevent
    abuse by limiting the number of concurrent listings per user. The method updates
    internal player data structures that track auction limits, ensuring that players
    cannot exceed their configured maximum even if they attempt to post more auctions
    than allowed. This functionality helps maintain fair play and system stability
    in the auction house environment.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose auction limit is
      being set. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game database.
  - name: maxAuctions
    description: The maximum number of concurrent auctions that the specified player
      is allowed to post. Must be a non-negative integer representing the cap on active
      auctions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Auctions for a Player
    code: 'AuctionHouse::SetMaxConcurrentAuctions(12345, 10);

      // Sets player with GUID 12345 to be allowed up to 10 concurrent auctions.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Auction Limit for a Player
    code: 'AuctionHouse::SetMaxConcurrentAuctions(67890, 0);

      // Removes auction limit for player with GUID 67890 (effectively disabling concurrent
      auctions).'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal database records or in-memory caches
    to reflect the new auction limit. It may also trigger validation checks to ensure
    that existing auctions do not exceed the new cap, potentially removing or invalidating
    any excess auctions if necessary.
  warnings: Setting a very low value (e.g., 0) will prevent players from posting any
    new auctions, which could negatively impact gameplay experience. Ensure that this
    method is called appropriately during player account management or server configuration
    updates to avoid unintended consequences.
