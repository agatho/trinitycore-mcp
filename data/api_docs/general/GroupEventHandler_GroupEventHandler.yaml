  method: GroupEventHandler
  signature: void GroupEventHandler::GroupEventHandler(BotAI * botAI)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GroupEventHandler instance with the provided BotAI object for
    managing group-related events.
  description: The GroupEventHandler constructor initializes an event handler responsible
    for processing and responding to group-related events within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method sets up internal state using the provided BotAI pointer, which is
    essential for the handler to access bot-specific data, player information, and
    group management functions. The initialization ensures that the event handler
    can properly monitor group changes, member status updates, and other relevant
    group events during gameplay. This constructor is typically called when creating
    a new instance of a group event handler for a specific bot AI instance.

  examples:
  - title: Basic GroupEventHandler Initialization
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();

      GroupEventHandler handler(botAI);

      // The handler is now ready to process group events for the specified bot AI'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any asynchronous operations or heavy initialization.
    It simply stores the provided BotAI pointer and sets up basic internal state.
    The actual event handling logic is implemented in separate methods that are called
    when group events occur.
