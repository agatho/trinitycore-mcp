documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spell resource cost data from the database into memory
    for use during spell execution.
  description: The LoadSpellResourceCosts method is responsible for retrieving all
    spell resource cost definitions from the database and caching them in memory.
    This method is typically called during server startup or when reloading spell
    data to ensure that all spells have their correct resource requirements (such
    as mana, rage, energy, or focus) available for validation and deduction during
    spell casting. The method iterates through the database entries for spell resource
    costs, parses the data, and stores it in internal lookup structures so that spell
    systems can quickly access these values when processing player actions or NPC
    spell casts.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellResourceCosts()\n{\n    sResourceManager->LoadSpellResourceCosts();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    explicitly reloading spell data. It is not thread-safe and should be executed
    in a single-threaded context to prevent race conditions. The method assumes that
    the database connection is already established and that the relevant tables (such
    as spell_resource_costs) contain valid data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that any existing cached data is properly
    cleared before reloading. This method does not validate the integrity of the loaded
    data; it simply loads what's present in the database.
