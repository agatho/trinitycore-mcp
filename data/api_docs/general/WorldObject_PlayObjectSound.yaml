documentation:
  brief: Plays a sound effect at the object location for specified targets
  description: The PlayObjectSound method plays a sound kit at the WorldObject's location,
    allowing for custom sound effects to be triggered for specific target players.
    This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft for triggering audio events
    during quest interactions, NPC dialogues, or other game mechanics where sound
    feedback is required. The sound can be broadcast to a single player or multiple
    players depending on the target parameters provided. It's important to note that
    this method does not directly play sounds for all players in the area, but rather
    requires explicit targeting of specific players.
  parameters:
  - name: soundKitId
    description: The sound kit ID to play, which corresponds to a specific sound entry
      in the game database. This value determines what sound will be played at the
      object location.
  - name: targetObject
    description: The GUID of the target object that will hear the sound. This parameter
      is optional and can be used to specify a single player or other object.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the specific Player object that will receive the sound.
      This parameter is optional and allows for targeting specific players rather
      than all nearby players.
  - name: broadcastTextId
    description: The broadcast text ID associated with the sound, which can be used
      to link sound effects to specific text messages or dialogue events in the game.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'WorldObject* object = GetWorldObject();

      object->PlayObjectSound(12345, ObjectGuid::Full, nullptr, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with player targeting
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = GetPlayer();

      WorldObject* object = GetWorldObject();

      object->PlayObjectSound(12345, ObjectGuid::Full, targetPlayer, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other game mechanics such
    as quest completion or NPC dialogue. The sound kit ID must be valid and exist
    in the database for this method to work properly. Performance considerations include
    the fact that playing sounds for multiple players simultaneously can impact server
    performance if not handled carefully.
  warnings: The method requires proper targeting of objects to ensure correct playback.
    Improper use may result in sounds playing at incorrect locations or to wrong players.
    Also, using invalid sound kit IDs can cause errors and potential crashes.
