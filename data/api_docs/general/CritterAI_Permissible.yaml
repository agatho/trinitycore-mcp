  class: CritterAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int CritterAI::Permissible(const int * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether this AI can be assigned to a given creature type
  description: The Permissible method is used by the TrinityCore AI system to evaluate
    if a CritterAI instance should be assigned to a specific creature. It takes a
    pointer to a creature's entry ID and returns an integer indicating the level of
    permissibility. This allows the core AI selection logic to determine which AI
    behavior should be applied to different types of creatures. The method is part
    of the AI system's dynamic assignment mechanism and helps ensure that only appropriate
    AIs are attached to creatures based on their type or other criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the creature's entry ID. This
      value identifies what type of creature this AI is being evaluated for assignment
      to.
  returns: 'Returns an integer indicating permissibility level:

    - 100: Fully permissible, CritterAI should be assigned

    - 0: Not permissible, do not assign CritterAI

    - Negative values: May indicate conditional or restricted assignment

    The return value is used by the AI system to make assignment decisions during
    creature initialization'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Permissible Check
    code: "class MyCritterAI : public CritterAI {\npublic:\n    int Permissible(const\
      \ int* creature) override {\n        // Allow assignment to all critters\n \
      \       return 100;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Permissible Assignment
    code: "class SpecialCritterAI : public CritterAI {\npublic:\n    int Permissible(const\
      \ int* creature) override {\n        // Only allow for specific critter types\n\
      \        if (*creature == 12345 || *creature == 12346) {\n            return\
      \ 100; // Assign this AI\n        }\n        return 0; // Do not assign\n  \
      \  }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during creature creation and AI assignment. It's important
    to note that returning 100 doesn't guarantee the AI will be assigned - other systems
    may override this decision. The parameter is a pointer to an integer, so make
    sure it's not null before dereferencing.
  warnings: Never return values outside of the expected range (typically 0-100) as
    this can cause undefined behavior in the AI system. Be cautious when using pointers
    and ensure they are valid before dereferencing them.
