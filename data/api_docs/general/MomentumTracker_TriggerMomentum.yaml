  class: MomentumTracker
  method: TriggerMomentum
  signature: void MomentumTracker::TriggerMomentum()
documentation:
  brief: Triggers the momentum effect for the tracked unit, applying movement speed
    modifications and cooldowns.
  description: The TriggerMomentum method activates the momentum mechanic for a unit
    that is being tracked by this MomentumTracker instance. This typically involves
    increasing the unit's movement speed temporarily, applying relevant buffs or debuffs,
    and initiating a cooldown period to prevent immediate reactivation. The method
    is commonly used in game mechanics such as sprinting, dash abilities, or other
    movement-based powers that require momentum tracking. It modifies the unit's current
    movement state and ensures proper timing between successive momentum applications.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Momentum Trigger
    code: "MomentumTracker* tracker = player->GetMomentumTracker();\nif (tracker)\n\
      {\n    tracker->TriggerMomentum();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on units that have an active MomentumTracker.
    The cooldown period is managed internally and cannot be overridden directly by
    external calls.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying the existence of a valid MomentumTracker
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper null checks are performed
    before invocation.
