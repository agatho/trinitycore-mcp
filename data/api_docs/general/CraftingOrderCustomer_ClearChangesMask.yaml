documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the crafting order customer, resetting its modified
    state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a CraftingOrderCustomer instance. This operation typically clears any dirty
    flags or modification indicators that track which fields of the customer object
    have been altered since the last synchronization or update. In the context of
    TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this is commonly used during data serialization,
    network packet preparation, or when committing changes to the database to ensure
    only modified fields are processed. The method does not take any parameters and
    has no return value.

    code: 'CraftingOrderCustomer customer;

      customer.ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core system when preparing
    data for synchronization or after applying changes. It's important to understand
    that clearing the mask does not revert any actual data changes; it only resets
    the tracking mechanism.
