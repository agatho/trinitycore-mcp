documentation:
  brief: Enables the Beacon of Faith ability for a Holy Paladin, allowing them to
    share healing with nearby allies.
  description: The EnableBeaconOfFaith method activates the Beacon of Faith spell
    effect for a Holy Paladin character. This ability allows the paladin to place
    a beacon that shares a portion of incoming heals with nearby friendly targets
    within a specified radius. The method typically sets internal flags or state variables
    to indicate that the beacon is active and ready to function. It's part of the
    Holy Paladin's healing toolkit, enabling strategic positioning and efficient damage
    mitigation for group encounters. This method should only be called when the paladin
    has the required spell learned and meets any necessary resource or condition requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Beacon Activation
    code: 'HolyPaladinBeaconTracker* beaconTracker = player->GetBeaconTracker();

      beaconTracker->EnableBeaconOfFaith();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state tracking variables to indicate
    that Beacon of Faith is active. It may also register the beacon with the game's
    spell effect system or healing distribution logic. The actual visual effects and
    gameplay mechanics are handled by the core TrinityCore spell system.
  warnings: Ensure that the paladin has learned the Beacon of Faith spell before calling
    this method, otherwise it may result in undefined behavior or silent failure.
    This method should not be called repeatedly without proper cooldown handling.
