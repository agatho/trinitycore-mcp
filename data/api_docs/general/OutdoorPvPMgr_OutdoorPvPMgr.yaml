  brief: Moves an OutdoorPvPMgr instance to another OutdoorPvPMgr instance using move
    semantics.
  description: This method is a move constructor for the OutdoorPvPMgr class, which
    transfers ownership of resources from one OutdoorPvPMgr object to another. It
    is typically used in scenarios where an existing OutdoorPvPMgr instance needs
    to be replaced or reassigned without copying its contents. The move constructor
    ensures efficient resource management by transferring internal data structures
    and pointers rather than performing deep copies. This operation leaves the source
    object in a valid but unspecified state, meaning it should not be used after the
    move operation. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, OutdoorPvPMgr
    handles outdoor player versus player zones and their associated logic, so this
    move constructor allows for efficient management of these systems during object
    lifecycle operations.

  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'OutdoorPvPMgr manager1;

      // ... initialize manager1 ...

      OutdoorPvPMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Moves resources from manager1
      to manager2

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard C++ move semantics. After the move, the source
    object should not be used unless reinitialized. The move constructor is particularly
    useful when returning objects from functions or managing containers of OutdoorPvPMgr
    instances.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after this operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that any references or pointers to the original object are invalidated
    after the move.
