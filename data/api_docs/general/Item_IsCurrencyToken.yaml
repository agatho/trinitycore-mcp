documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is a currency token
  description: This method checks if the current Item object represents a currency
    token, which are items used in World of Warcraft for trading and purchasing various
    in-game content. Currency tokens typically have specific item flags or properties
    that distinguish them from regular items. The method returns true if the item
    is classified as a currency token, false otherwise. This functionality is essential
    for handling currency-related mechanics within the game's trading system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is a currency token, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the item can be used for currency transactions or exchange.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 0);\nif (item->IsCurrencyToken())\
      \ {\n    // Handle currency token\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation relies on internal item flags and properties. Performance
    impact is minimal as this method performs simple flag checks. Thread safety is
    ensured since item objects are typically accessed within single-threaded contexts.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine currency token value or quantity;
    use other methods for those purposes. Be aware that some items may have multiple
    flags and this method only checks for currency token designation.
