  class: Creature
  method: GetTrainerId
  signature: uint32 Creature::GetTrainerId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the trainer ID associated with the creature, used for identifying
    training professions.
  description: The GetTrainerId method retrieves the unique identifier that corresponds
    to a specific trainer type for the creature. This ID is typically used in conjunction
    with the trainer's training profession or skill, allowing the game to determine
    which specific trainer the creature represents. The method is commonly used in
    scenarios where creatures act as trainers for players, and it helps identify the
    correct trainer type based on the creature's data. It is important to note that
    this value may be zero if the creature does not function as a trainer or if no
    valid trainer ID has been assigned.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the trainer ID associated with the creature,
    which corresponds to a specific trainer type in the game database. A value of
    zero indicates that the creature is not a trainer or does not have a valid trainer
    ID assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 trainerId = creature->GetTrainerId();\nif (trainerId != 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Creature is a trainer\n    // Do something with the trainerId\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other trainer-related methods
    such as GetTrainerType or GetTrainerSpell. The value returned by this method should
    be validated against database entries to ensure correctness. Performance-wise,
    this method is lightweight and does not involve any complex operations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the creature might
    not actually be a trainer; it's possible for the method to return zero even if
    the creature has a valid entry in the database but is not marked as a trainer.
    Always verify that the creature actually functions as a trainer before relying
    on this value.
