documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns a random emote type from the available emotes.
  description: The SelectRandomEmote method retrieves a random emote type from the
    internal collection of available emotes. This method is typically used in social
    interactions or when a player or NPC needs to perform an arbitrary emote without
    specifying a particular one. The selection process ensures that all registered
    emotes have an equal chance of being chosen, providing dynamic and varied social
    behavior within the game. The returned EmoteType can be used directly with other
    social system functions to trigger the actual emote animation or action.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a randomly selected EmoteType value from the available emotes.
    This value represents one of the predefined emote types such as EMOTE_STATE_SLEEP,
    EMOTE_STATE_SIT, etc., which can be used to trigger corresponding animations or
    actions in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EmoteType randomEmote = socialManager.SelectRandomEmote();

      // Use the emote type to trigger an animation

      player->HandleEmoteCommand(randomEmote);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on a pseudo-random number generator for selecting emotes,
    so repeated calls may return the same value if the random seed is not properly
    initialized. The internal emote list should be populated before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior.
