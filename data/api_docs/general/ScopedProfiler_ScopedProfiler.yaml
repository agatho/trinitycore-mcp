  brief: Moves a ScopedProfiler instance to another ScopedProfiler instance, transferring
    ownership of its profiling data.
  description: The ScopedProfiler move constructor transfers all profiling data and
    state from the source ScopedProfiler object to the destination object. This operation
    is typically used when moving ScopedProfiler objects between scopes or containers,
    allowing efficient transfer without copying expensive profiling information. The
    moved-from object becomes invalid and should not be used after this operation.
    This method is part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern
    for performance profiling in TrinityCore, where profiling data is automatically
    collected and reported upon object destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'ScopedProfiler profiler1("FunctionA");

      // ... some code ...

      ScopedProfiler profiler2 = std::move(profiler1); // Move profiler1 to profiler2

      // profiler1 is now invalid and should not be used'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<ScopedProfiler> profilers;

      profilers.emplace_back("FunctionA");

      profilers.emplace_back(std::move(profilers.front())); // Move first profiler
      to second

      // First profiler is now invalid, second contains the moved data'
    language: cpp
  notes: The move constructor ensures no profiling data is duplicated or lost during
    transfer. It's important to understand that after moving, the source ScopedProfiler
    object should not be accessed or destroyed as it may contain undefined state.
    This implementation typically involves swapping internal pointers or handles rather
    than copying large amounts of profiling data.
  warnings: Using a moved-from ScopedProfiler object results in undefined behavior.
    Always ensure that objects are not used after being moved. Be cautious when moving
    ScopedProfiler objects within containers, as reallocation may invalidate moved
    references.
