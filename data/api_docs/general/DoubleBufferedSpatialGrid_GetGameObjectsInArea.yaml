  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: GetGameObjectsInArea
  signature: int DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GetGameObjectsInArea(const int & center,
    float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all game objects within a specified radius around a given center
    point in the spatial grid.
  description: The GetGameObjectsInArea method searches through the double-buffered
    spatial grid structure to find and return all game objects located within a defined
    circular area. It takes a center coordinate and a radius as inputs, then performs
    a spatial query to collect matching objects. This method is commonly used for
    area-of-effect spells, loot detection, NPC interaction range checks, or any gameplay
    mechanic requiring proximity-based object discovery. The method operates on the
    current spatial grid state and returns a count of found objects, which can be
    used to iterate through or process the results.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the search area, represented as an integer identifier
      (likely a grid cell index or spatial coordinate). This parameter defines where
      the circular search originates.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular area to search for game objects. Must
      be a positive floating-point value representing the distance from the center
      point.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of game objects found within
    the specified area. A return value of zero indicates no matching objects were
    located, while a positive integer indicates the count of found objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearby game objects
    code: "int count = grid.GetGameObjectsInArea(100, 5.0f);\nif (count > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Process the found game objects\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << count\
      \ << \" game objects\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to iterate through found objects
    code: "const int center = 250;\nconst float radius = 10.0f;\nint count = grid.GetGameObjectsInArea(center,\
      \ radius);\n// Assume there's a method to retrieve the actual objects\nfor (int\
      \ i = 0; i < count; ++i)\n{\n    GameObject* obj = grid.GetObjectAtIndex(i);\n\
      \    if (obj)\n    {\n        // Perform actions with each found object\n  \
      \      obj->HandleInteraction();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on a double-buffered spatial grid system, which may have
    performance implications during frequent queries. The center parameter is likely
    interpreted as a grid cell index or a coordinate value depending on the internal
    implementation. Ensure that radius is positive and within reasonable bounds to
    avoid excessive processing overhead.
  warnings: Using very large radius values can cause performance degradation due to
    scanning many grid cells. The method assumes valid input parameters; invalid center
    indices or negative radii may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
