  class: HunterBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool HunterBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target,
    BaselineRotationManager & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the hunter's baseline rotation logic for targeting and spell casting.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method performs the core logic of a hunter's baseline
    rotation, determining which abilities to cast based on current game state, target
    conditions, and resource availability. It evaluates the bot's current situation
    including health, mana, target distance, and cooldowns to make tactical decisions
    about spell usage. The method integrates with the BaselineRotationManager to coordinate
    complex rotation sequences and ensure proper timing of abilities. This function
    is typically called during combat situations where automated decision-making is
    required for optimal performance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot's player data structure containing current state,
      stats, and inventory information
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target's player or creature data structure for evaluating
      combat conditions and positioning
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager that handles rotation state
      tracking, cooldown management, and sequence coordination
  returns: Returns true if the rotation was successfully executed and a spell or action
    was performed, false if no action was taken due to insufficient resources, invalid
    conditions, or rotation constraints
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rotation Execution
    code: "HunterBaselineRotation rotation;\nint botData[100];\nint targetData[100];\n\
      BaselineRotationManager manager;\nbool result = rotation.ExecuteRotation(botData,\
      \ targetData, manager);\nif (result) {\n    // Action was performed\n    printf(\"\
      Rotation executed successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // No action taken\n  \
      \  printf(\"No action performed\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (IsInCombat()) {\n        HunterBaselineRotation\
      \ rotation;\n        int* bot = GetBotData();\n        int* target = GetTargetData();\n\
      \        BaselineRotationManager& manager = GetRotationManager();\n        \n\
      \        if (!rotation.ExecuteRotation(bot, target, manager)) {\n          \
      \  // Fallback to basic attack or movement\n            PerformBasicAttack();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot and target data structures are properly
    initialized before calling. The BaselineRotationManager must be properly configured
    with rotation rules and cooldown information. Performance is optimized for frequent
    calls during combat, but complex rotation logic may introduce slight delays during
    high-frequency updates.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that both bot and target pointers
    are valid and properly initialized. Improper management of the BaselineRotationManager
    can lead to incorrect rotation behavior or infinite loops. The method may return
    false even when combat conditions are favorable, so callers should implement appropriate
    fallback logic.
