  class: Player
  method: AddBattlegroundQueueId
  signature: uint32 Player::AddBattlegroundQueueId(int val)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a battleground queue ID to the player's queue list and returns the unique
    identifier.
  description: This method adds a battleground queue ID to the player's current battleground
    queue list, allowing the player to participate in battleground matchmaking. The
    method returns the unique identifier of the added queue entry, which can be used
    for tracking or removing the queue later. This is typically used during battleground
    registration process and is essential for maintaining proper queue state in the
    game system.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: The battleground queue ID to add, representing a specific battleground
      instance or queue type
  returns: Returns the unique identifier (uint32) of the added battleground queue
    entry, which serves as a reference for tracking and managing the queue in the
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 queueId = player->AddBattlegroundQueueId(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "uint32 queueId = player->AddBattlegroundQueueId(BattlegroundMgr::GetBattlegroundQueueId(0));\n\
      // Use queueId to track and manage queue entries\nif (queueId != 0)\n{\n   \
      \ // Queue successfully added\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Queue failed to add\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground registration process
    when a player joins a specific battleground queue. The returned queue ID can be
    used for subsequent operations like removing the queue entry or checking queue
    status. Implementation requires careful handling of queue state management and
    may involve thread safety considerations.
  warnings: The method should only be called when a player is actually registering
    for a battleground, not during regular gameplay. Calling this method outside of
    proper context may cause queue state inconsistencies or invalid queue entries.
