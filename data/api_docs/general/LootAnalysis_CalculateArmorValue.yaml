  class: LootAnalysis
  method: CalculateArmorValue
  signature: float LootAnalysis::CalculateArmorValue(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the armor value of a loot item for a given player.
  description: The CalculateArmorValue method determines the effective armor value
    of a specific loot item as it would be applied to a player character. This calculation
    takes into account various factors such as the item's base armor stats, any enchantments
    or modifiers, and potentially the player's current gear state. The result is returned
    as a floating-point value representing the calculated armor contribution. This
    method is typically used in loot analysis systems to evaluate item quality and
    suitability for different character classes or roles.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the armor value is being calculated.
      Must not be null.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      item being evaluated. The item must have valid armor data.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated armor value of the loot item
    for the specified player. Returns 0.0 if the item has no armor or if invalid parameters
    are provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      LootItem item = ...;

      float armorValue = LootAnalysis::CalculateArmorValue(player, item);

      // Use armorValue for loot evaluation

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Loot Evaluation
    code: "Player* player = session->GetPlayer();\nfor (auto& lootItem : player->GetLoot().GetLootItems())\
      \ {\n    float armorValue = LootAnalysis::CalculateArmorValue(player, lootItem);\n\
      \    if (armorValue > 50.0f) {\n        // Consider this item valuable for armor\n\
      \    }\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform calculations involving item stats, enchantments,
    and player-specific modifiers. It is recommended to ensure that the Player object
    and LootItem are valid before calling this method. The exact calculation logic
    might vary based on game version and patch updates.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for either parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure all required item data is properly initialized before
    invoking this method.
