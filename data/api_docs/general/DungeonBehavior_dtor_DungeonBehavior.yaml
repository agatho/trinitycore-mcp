documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DungeonBehavior instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the DungeonBehavior class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this typically
    involves releasing references to dungeon-related data structures, clearing internal
    state, and ensuring no memory leaks occur when a dungeon behavior instance is
    removed from memory. This method is automatically called by the C++ runtime when
    an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of DungeonBehavior object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    DungeonBehavior* dungeon = new DungeonBehavior();\n\
      \    // ... use dungeon ...\n    delete dungeon; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when objects go out of
    scope or are deleted. Ensure that any derived classes properly implement their
    own destructors to clean up their specific resources.
