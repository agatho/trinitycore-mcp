documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has met the item requirements for a specified quest objective
  description: The CheckItemObjective method evaluates whether the player's inventory
    contains the required items specified by a quest objective. It verifies that the
    player possesses the correct quantity and type of items needed to complete the
    objective. This method is typically called during quest progress evaluation and
    handles item counting, stacking, and quest-specific item requirements. The method
    operates on a specific quest and objective index, ensuring that only the relevant
    objective is checked against the player's current inventory state.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing the objective to be checked.
      Must not be null.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Zero-based index of the specific objective within the quest to evaluate.
      Must be a valid index within the quest's objectives range.
  returns: Returns true if the player has met all item requirements for the specified
    quest objective, false otherwise. The method returns false when items are missing,
    insufficient in quantity, or when the player does not possess the required items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Quest Item Objective
    code: "if (questManager->CheckItemObjective(quest, 0)) {\n    // Player has met\
      \ the first objective's item requirements\n    player->CompleteQuest(quest->GetQuestId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Objectives in a Loop
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < quest->GetObjectiveCount(); ++i) {\n    if (!questManager->CheckItemObjective(quest,\
      \ i)) {\n        // Objective not met, skip to next\n        continue;\n   \
      \ }\n    // Process completed objective\n    player->UpdateQuestObjective(i);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs inventory checks using the player's current item counts
    and does not modify the player's inventory state. It relies on the quest's objective
    data structure to determine what items are required and in what quantities. The
    method should only be called when the player is actively engaged with a quest
    and its objectives are being evaluated.
  warnings: This method assumes that the quest pointer and objective index are valid.
    Passing an invalid quest pointer or an out-of-bounds objective index may result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the quest has been properly loaded and that
    the objective index corresponds to an actual objective before calling this method.
