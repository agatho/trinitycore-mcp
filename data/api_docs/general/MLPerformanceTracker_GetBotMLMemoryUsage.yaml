    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the memory usage of machine learning models for a specified bot.
  description: The GetBotMLMemoryUsage method returns the amount of memory, in bytes,
    currently consumed by machine learning models associated with a specific bot identified
    by its GUID. This method is part of the MLPerformanceTracker class and is used
    to monitor resource consumption for AI-driven bots within the TrinityCore framework.
    It allows developers and administrators to track how much memory each bot's ML
    components are using, which is crucial for performance optimization and preventing
    memory leaks in large-scale bot deployments. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call from multiple threads.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64_t value representing the total memory usage in bytes of the machine
    learning models associated with the specified bot. Returns 0 if the bot GUID is
    invalid or no ML models are currently loaded for that bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      uint64_t memoryUsage = performanceTracker.GetBotMLMemoryUsage(botGuid);

      std::cout << "Memory usage: " << memoryUsage << " bytes" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Multiple Bots
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32_t guid\
      \ : botGuids) {\n    uint64_t usage = performanceTracker.GetBotMLMemoryUsage(guid);\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Bot \" << guid << \" ML memory: \" << usage << \" bytes\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ML models for the specified bot have been properly
    initialized and loaded. The returned value includes all memory allocated by the
    bot's ML components, including weights, activations, and temporary buffers. For
    accurate monitoring, ensure that bots are regularly updated with their current
    memory usage statistics.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent bot GUID may return 0 without throwing
    an exception. Always validate the bot GUID before calling this method if strict
    error handling is required. Additionally, frequent calls to this method might
    introduce performance overhead in high-frequency scenarios.
