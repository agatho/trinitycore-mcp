  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: ExecuteGroupCoordinationStrategy
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ExecuteGroupCoordinationStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the group coordination strategy for a player during quest turn-in.
  description: The ExecuteGroupCoordinationStrategy method handles the logic required
    to manage how a player's quest turn-in is coordinated within a group context.
    This includes distributing quest rewards, managing quest credit assignment, and
    ensuring proper synchronization of quest completion events among group members.
    The method typically evaluates the current group composition, checks for eligible
    participants, and applies appropriate reward distribution or quest update mechanisms
    based on the configured group coordination settings.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is executing
      the quest turn-in. This player must be part of a group for the coordination
      strategy to have meaningful effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Coordination
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is in a group

      QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      questTurnIn.ExecuteGroupCoordinationStrategy(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player is already part of a valid group and
    that the quest turn-in process has been initiated. It does not perform any validation
    on whether the player can actually turn in the quest; it focuses solely on the
    coordination aspects within the group.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the player is in a group may lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect quest state updates. Ensure proper group membership
    checks before invocation.
