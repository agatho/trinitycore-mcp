  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::~DynamicQuestSystem()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the DynamicQuestSystem instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the DynamicQuestSystem class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This
    includes cleaning up any dynamically allocated data structures, canceling pending
    operations, and ensuring that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. In the
    context of TrinityCore's quest system, this method ensures proper cleanup of dynamic
    quest data that may have been created or modified during runtime. The destructor
    is automatically invoked when a DynamicQuestSystem object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Destruction
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem* questSystem = new DynamicQuestSystem();

      // ... use the quest system ...

      delete questSystem; // Triggers ~DynamicQuestSystem()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should not be called directly unless the object was allocated
    on the heap. It's important to ensure that all references to the DynamicQuestSystem
    are cleared before deletion to prevent use-after-free errors. The cleanup process
    may involve notifying other subsystems about the destruction of the quest system.
  warnings: Calling this destructor manually on stack-allocated objects will result
    in undefined behavior. Always ensure proper object lifetime management when working
    with DynamicQuestSystem instances.
