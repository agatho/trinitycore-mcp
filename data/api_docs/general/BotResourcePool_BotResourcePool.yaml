documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotResourcePool class with default values.
  description: The BotResourcePool constructor initializes a new instance of the BotResourcePool
    class. This method sets up the internal state and data structures required for
    managing bot resource allocation. The constructor typically performs initialization
    tasks such as setting default values for member variables, allocating memory,
    or preparing internal collections used for tracking bot resources. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI framework, this class likely manages resources like gold,
    items, or other in-game assets that bots can access or consume during their operation.
    This method is automatically invoked when a new BotResourcePool object is created
    and should not be called manually unless constructing a new instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BotResourcePool instance
    code: 'BotResourcePool resourcePool;

      // The constructor is automatically called here, initializing the pool with
      default settings.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor and does not accept any parameters. It's important
    to note that while this method initializes the object state, it may not fully
    configure all internal data structures depending on the implementation details
    of the BotResourcePool class. Additional setup or configuration methods might
    be required after instantiation.
