  class: MonkAI
  method: OptimizePositioning
  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizePositioning(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the Monk AI's positioning strategy based on target proximity and
    combat conditions.
  description: The OptimizePositioning method in the MonkAI class calculates and applies
    optimal positioning adjustments for a monk character during combat. It evaluates
    the distance to the target, considers the monk's current abilities and cooldowns,
    and modifies the AI's movement behavior to maintain ideal combat range. This method
    is typically invoked during AI update cycles to dynamically adjust positioning
    without requiring explicit user input. The method does not directly control movement
    but rather influences the AI's decision-making process regarding positioning strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or index
      within the AI's target list. This parameter is used to determine the optimal
      positioning relative to the current combat target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        int targetId = GetTargetId();\n        OptimizePositioning(&targetId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state management
    code: "void MonkAI::DoCombatAction()\n{\n    if (IsInMeleeRange())\n    {\n  \
      \      int target = GetTargetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        OptimizePositioning(&target);\n\
      \        // Proceed with melee attack\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Move\
      \ closer before optimizing positioning\n        MoveToTarget();\n        OptimizePositioning(&target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI's tactical decision-making system and
    should be called regularly during combat updates. The method relies on internal
    state tracking of target distance, ability cooldowns, and current monk stance
    to make positioning decisions. It does not directly control character movement
    but influences the AI's positioning strategy through internal state changes.
  warnings: The target parameter must point to a valid target identifier; otherwise,
    the method may produce undefined behavior or incorrect positioning calculations.
    Ensure that the target is in combat before calling this method to avoid unnecessary
    processing.
