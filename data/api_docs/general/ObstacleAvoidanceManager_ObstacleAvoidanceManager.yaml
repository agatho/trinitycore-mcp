  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::ObstacleAvoidanceManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ObstacleAvoidanceManager instance for the specified player
    bot.
  description: The ObstacleAvoidanceManager constructor initializes the obstacle avoidance
    system for a given player bot. This manager handles pathfinding and collision
    detection to prevent bots from walking into walls, objects, or other obstacles
    within the game world. It sets up internal data structures and registers necessary
    callbacks for movement updates. The initialization process typically occurs during
    bot creation or when enabling AI behavior for a player-controlled unit.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will use obstacle
      avoidance functionality. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer

      ObstacleAvoidanceManager avoidanceManager(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization logic. It primarily
    sets up internal references and prepares the manager for use in the bot's AI system.
    The actual obstacle avoidance behavior is handled by other methods in the class.
