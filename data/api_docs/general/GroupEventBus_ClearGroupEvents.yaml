  class: GroupEventBus
  method: ClearGroupEvents
  signature: void GroupEventBus::ClearGroupEvents(int groupGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears all events associated with a specified group GUID from the GroupEventBus.
  description: The ClearGroupEvents method removes all registered events that are
    tied to a specific group identifier (groupGuid) from the GroupEventBus. This functionality
    is typically used during group destruction, member removal, or when resetting
    group-related event subscriptions to prevent memory leaks or stale event handlers.
    The method ensures that no further event callbacks will be triggered for the specified
    group, maintaining clean state management within the event system. It operates
    on a per-group basis and does not affect other groups or global events.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group whose events should be
      cleared from the event bus. This value must correspond to a valid existing group
      in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear Events for a Specific Group
    code: "void RemoveGroupFromEventBus(Group* group)\n{\n    if (group)\n    {\n\
      \        sGroupEventBus->ClearGroupEvents(group->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided groupGuid is valid and corresponds
    to an actual group. If called with an invalid or non-existent group GUID, behavior
    may vary depending on implementation details of GroupEventBus. It's recommended
    to verify group existence before invoking this method.
