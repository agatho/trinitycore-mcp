  brief: Moves a TransportMgr object to a new location, transferring all associated
    transport data and state.
  description: The TransportMgr::TransportMgr(TransportMgr&&) method is a move constructor
    that transfers ownership of all internal resources and data from one TransportMgr
    instance to another. This operation is typically used during object initialization
    or reassignment when moving an existing TransportMgr object's state to a new instance.
    The move constructor ensures efficient resource management by avoiding expensive
    deep copies, instead transferring pointers, handles, or other resource identifiers
    directly. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method
    supports efficient transport system management where transports (such as boats
    or zeppelins) are moved between different data structures or contexts without
    duplicating their underlying transport information.

  examples:
  - title: Move TransportMgr to New Instance
    code: 'TransportMgr oldTransportMgr;

      // ... populate oldTransportMgr with transport data ...

      TransportMgr newTransportMgr = std::move(oldTransportMgr);

      // oldTransportMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a regular constructor. It should only be
    called with an rvalue reference to avoid unintended copying. After the move operation,
    the source TransportMgr object should not be used for further operations as its
    internal state has been transferred.
  warnings: Using this constructor on an already moved-from object or attempting to
    use the source object afterward may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that
    the source object is not accessed after being moved from.
