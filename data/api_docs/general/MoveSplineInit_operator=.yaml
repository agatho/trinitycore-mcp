documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a MoveSplineInit object to another MoveSplineInit object
    using move semantics.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment of a MoveSplineInit
    object, transferring all resources from the source object to the target object.
    This is a move operation that leaves the source object in a valid but unspecified
    state. In the context of TrinityCore's movement system, this method is used to
    efficiently transfer spline initialization data between movement objects without
    unnecessary copying. The MoveSplineInit class is typically used for handling character
    or creature movement paths in the game world, and this assignment operator ensures
    efficient resource management during movement state transitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target MoveSplineInit object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'MoveSplineInit source;

      // ... initialize source ...

      MoveSplineInit target = std::move(source); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: In Function Context
    code: "MoveSplineInit createSplineInit() {\n    MoveSplineInit init;\n    // ...\
      \ configure spline ...\n    return init; // Move semantics used in return\n\
      }\n\nvoid useSpline() {\n    MoveSplineInit spline = createSplineInit();\n \
      \   // spline now owns the movement data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move assignment operator that leverages C++11 move semantics. It
    should only be used when the source object is no longer needed after the operation.
    The implementation typically involves transferring internal pointers or handles
    rather than deep copying data structures, which makes it more efficient than copy
    operations.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source object should not be used in any
    way that might access its former resources, as those have been moved to the target
    object. Using the source object after a move assignment can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
