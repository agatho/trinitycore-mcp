api:
  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: GetSellerReputationScore
  signature: float MarketAnalysis::GetSellerReputationScore(uint32 sellerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the reputation score of a specified seller based on
    market activity and transaction history.
  description: The GetSellerReputationScore method computes a numerical reputation
    value for a given seller identified by their GUID. This score reflects the seller's
    trustworthiness and reliability within the game's marketplace, typically derived
    from factors such as transaction success rate, item quality consistency, feedback
    from buyers, and adherence to marketplace rules. The method is designed to help
    players make informed decisions when purchasing items from other players. It requires
    a valid seller GUID and returns a float value representing the reputation score,
    where higher values indicate better reputation. The calculation may involve internal
    caching or database lookups depending on the implementation details of the MarketAnalysis
    class.
  parameters:
  - name: sellerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the seller whose reputation score
      is to be retrieved. Must correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  returns: A floating-point number representing the seller's reputation score. Higher
    values indicate better reputation. Returns 0.0 if the seller GUID is invalid or
    no reputation data exists for the seller.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 sellerGuid = 12345;\nfloat reputationScore = marketAnalysis->GetSellerReputationScore(sellerGuid);\n\
      if (reputationScore > 0.0f)\n{\n    printf(\"Seller's reputation score: %.2f\\\
      n\", reputationScore);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Reputation Score for Decision Making
    code: "uint32 sellerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nfloat score = marketAnalysis->GetSellerReputationScore(sellerGuid);\n\
      if (score >= 8.0f)\n{\n    // Proceed with purchase\n    printf(\"Highly trusted\
      \ seller\\n\");\n}\nelse if (score >= 5.0f)\n{\n    // Consider before purchasing\n\
      \    printf(\"Moderate trust level\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Avoid purchasing\
      \ from this seller\n    printf(\"Low reputation seller\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may cache results for performance reasons. If the seller's reputation
    changes frequently, ensure that any cached values are invalidated or refreshed
    appropriately. The exact calculation logic (e.g., weighting of different factors)
    is not exposed in this API but is handled internally by the MarketAnalysis class.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent seller GUID may result in a return
    value of 0.0, which could be misinterpreted as a neutral reputation score. Always
    validate the GUID before calling this method if possible.
