  class: BotWorldEntry
  method: LoadTargetMap
  signature: bool BotWorldEntry::LoadTargetMap()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads the target map for bot behavior.
  description: The LoadTargetMap method is responsible for initializing and populating
    the internal target mapping structure used by the bot system. This method typically
    reads configuration data or performs setup operations to define which entities
    or locations the bot should consider as potential targets. It may involve loading
    from database entries, configuration files, or runtime data structures that determine
    the bot's targeting behavior in various game scenarios such as combat or quest
    completion. The method ensures that all necessary target data is available before
    the bot begins its operational phase.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target map was successfully loaded and initialized;
    otherwise, returns false if an error occurred during the loading process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotWorldEntry* entry = new BotWorldEntry();\nbool success = entry->LoadTargetMap();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Target map loaded successfully\n    printf(\"Target map\
      \ loaded successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to load target map.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a bot's lifecycle. Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks
    if not properly handled. The method might perform database queries or file I/O
    operations, so it could have performance implications depending on the size of
    the target data.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the underlying system
    components (e.g., database connections) may result in failed loads and subsequent
    errors during bot operation. Ensure that all required resources are available
    before invoking this method.
