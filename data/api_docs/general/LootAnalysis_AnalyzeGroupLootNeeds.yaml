  signature: void LootAnalysis::AnalyzeGroupLootNeeds(Group * group, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the loot needs of a group for a specific item.
  description: The AnalyzeGroupLootNeeds method evaluates the current loot distribution
    needs within a group for a given item. It determines which group members are eligible
    to receive the item based on their loot rules, item quality, and existing loot
    assignments. This method is typically invoked during group loot processing to
    ensure proper distribution according to World of Warcraft's loot system mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose loot needs
      are being analyzed. Must not be null.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being evaluated for group distribution. Must represent a valid loot
      item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Loot Analysis
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      item.itemid = 12345;

      item.count = 1;

      LootAnalysis::AnalyzeGroupLootNeeds(group, item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal loot tracking systems and may
    modify group loot state. It should only be called when processing group loot decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing invalid or uninitialized LootItem structures may lead to undefined
    behavior.
