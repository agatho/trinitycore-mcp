documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature can reset a player's talents.
  description: This method checks if a creature is capable of resetting a player's
    talent points, typically used in conjunction with NPC vendors or trainers. It
    evaluates whether the creature has the necessary flags and conditions to allow
    talent resets, which usually involves checking if the creature is a trainer or
    vendor that supports talent reset functionality. The method ensures that the player's
    current state allows for talent reset operations, such as being in a valid interaction
    state with the creature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature can reset the player's talents, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the creature supports talent reset functionality based
    on its flags and conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->CanResetTalents(player)) {\n    // Reset player's talents\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method typically relies on internal creature flags and state checks to
    determine eligibility. It should be used in conjunction with other methods like
    GetNpcFlags() or similar to ensure proper functionality.
  warnings: This method may not be suitable for all creatures; only certain NPCs like
    trainers or vendors support talent reset functionality. Misuse could lead to incorrect
    behavior during player interaction.
