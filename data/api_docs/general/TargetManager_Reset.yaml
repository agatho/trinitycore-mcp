  method: Reset
  signature: void TargetManager::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all current target references and resets the target manager's internal
    state to its initial condition.
  description: The Reset method clears all active target references within the TargetManager
    class, effectively resetting its internal state to a clean slate. This method
    is typically invoked when a unit needs to have its targeting behavior refreshed,
    such as after completing a spell cast, changing combat states, or transitioning
    between different AI phases. It ensures that no stale or invalid targets remain
    in memory and allows the manager to begin fresh target selection processes. The
    operation is generally performed during state transitions or cleanup routines
    within the game's AI and combat systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Reset
    code: "void UnitAI::OnCombatEnd()\n{\n    targetManager.Reset();\n    // Proceed\
      \ with cleanup or reinitialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before Spell Casting
    code: "void BossAI::CastSpellWithTargetedEffect()\n{\n    targetManager.Reset();\n\
      \    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_RANDOM, 0))\n    {\n    \
      \    targetManager.AddTarget(target);\n        DoCast(target, SPELL_DEATH_GRIP);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully during state transitions to avoid
    unintended side effects. It does not destroy the target objects themselves, only
    removes references from the manager. The reset operation is lightweight and intended
    for frequent use in AI logic.
  warnings: Calling Reset() while another thread may be accessing the target manager
    can lead to race conditions. Ensure proper synchronization if used in multithreaded
    contexts.
