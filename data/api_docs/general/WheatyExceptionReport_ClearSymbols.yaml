  brief: Clears all symbol information from the exception report.
  description: The ClearSymbols method removes all previously stored symbol data from
    the WheatyExceptionReport instance. This method is typically used to reset the
    report state before capturing new exception information or to free up memory associated
    with symbol resolution. The method does not take any parameters and performs no
    operations if no symbols are currently stored. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining clean exception reporting in debugging scenarios within TrinityCore's
    crash handling system.

  notes: This method is part of the exception handling infrastructure in TrinityCore
    and is automatically called during report initialization or when resetting the
    report state. It ensures that symbol data from previous exceptions does not interfere
    with subsequent crash reports.
