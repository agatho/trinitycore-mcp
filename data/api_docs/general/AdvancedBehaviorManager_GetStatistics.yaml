  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & AdvancedBehaviorManager::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the internal statistics structure of the
    AdvancedBehaviorManager.
  description: The GetStatistics method provides access to the current statistical
    data collected by the AdvancedBehaviorManager. This method is typically used to
    retrieve performance metrics, behavior execution counts, or other diagnostic information
    related to AI behaviors within the TrinityCore environment. The returned Statistics
    object is immutable, ensuring that external code cannot modify internal state
    through this interface. This method does not perform any computation or I/O operations;
    it simply returns a cached reference to pre-computed statistics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Statistics object containing various metrics
    and counters related to behavior execution within the AdvancedBehaviorManager.
    The reference remains valid for the lifetime of the AdvancedBehaviorManager instance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Behavior Statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = behaviorManager.GetStatistics();

      uint32 totalExecutions = stats.totalBehaviorExecutions;

      uint32 successfulBehaviors = stats.successfulBehaviorRuns;

      std::cout << "Total executions: " << totalExecutions << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The Statistics object returned by this method is typically updated asynchronously
    or during specific events such as behavior execution, making it important to consider
    potential staleness in high-frequency access scenarios. This method is thread-safe
    if the underlying Statistics structure is properly synchronized.
  warnings: While the returned reference is const, be aware that the Statistics object
    itself may be modified by internal operations of AdvancedBehaviorManager. If you
    need a snapshot of statistics at a specific point in time, consider copying the
    data rather than holding onto the reference.
