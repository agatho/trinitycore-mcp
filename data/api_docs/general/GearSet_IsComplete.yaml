documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the gear set contains all required items to be considered
    complete.
  description: The IsComplete method evaluates the current state of a GearSet object
    to determine if it meets the criteria for being fully equipped. This typically
    involves checking that all mandatory slots in the gear set have valid item entries,
    ensuring no required equipment is missing. The method is commonly used in gameplay
    logic where players must equip specific combinations of items to unlock abilities,
    achievements, or bonuses. It does not modify the GearSet state but returns a boolean
    value indicating completeness status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all required items are present and valid within the gear
    set; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a GearSet is complete
    code: "GearSet* playerGearSet = player->GetGearSet(0);\nif (playerGearSet->IsComplete())\
      \ {\n    // Apply bonus effects or unlock content\n    player->AddAchievementCriteria(ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_TYPE_COMPLETE_GEAR_SET,\
      \ 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a fast check on internal data structures to validate
    item presence rather than complex calculations. It may be called frequently during
    gameplay updates or UI refreshes, so performance is important.
