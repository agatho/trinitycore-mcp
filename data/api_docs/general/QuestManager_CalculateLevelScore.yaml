documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a level-based score for a given quest.
  description: The CalculateLevelScore method computes a float value representing
    the relative difficulty or reward scaling of a quest based on its level in comparison
    to the player's current level. This score is used internally by the QuestManager
    to determine various aspects such as quest rewards, experience points, and quest
    prioritization. The calculation typically considers the difference between the
    quest's level and the player's level, with adjustments for quest type, faction,
    and other game mechanics. This method does not modify any state and is purely
    a computational helper function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated level score for the quest. The
    exact meaning of this score depends on internal game logic but generally reflects
    how the quest's level compares to the player's level, affecting reward scaling
    and difficulty assessment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest processing
    code: "float score = questManager.CalculateLevelScore(quest);\nif (score > 1.0f)\
      \ {\n    // Quest is considered harder than player level\n    // Apply additional\
      \ difficulty modifiers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal quest data and player context to compute
    the score. It may be called frequently during quest evaluation, so performance
    should be considered in high-frequency scenarios. The exact formula used for calculation
    is not exposed but is consistent with TrinityCore's quest scoring system.
