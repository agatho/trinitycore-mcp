  class: BotMemoryProfile
  method: GetTotalUsage
  signature: uint64_t BotMemoryProfile::GetTotalUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total memory usage of the bot memory profile in
    bytes.
  description: The GetTotalUsage method computes the cumulative memory consumption
    of all entries stored within the BotMemoryProfile instance. This includes the
    overhead associated with each memory entry, such as metadata and internal tracking
    structures. The returned value represents a precise byte count that can be used
    for monitoring memory allocation, identifying potential memory leaks, or enforcing
    memory limits in bot behavior systems. This method is typically invoked during
    profiling sessions or when evaluating the resource footprint of AI-driven game
    entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64_t value representing the total memory usage in bytes consumed
    by all entries within the BotMemoryProfile instance. Returns zero if the profile
    is empty or uninitialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotMemoryProfile profile;

      // ... populate profile with data ...

      uint64_t total = profile.GetTotalUsage();

      std::cout << "Total memory usage: " << total << " bytes" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Memory Monitoring Example
    code: "void MonitorBotMemory(BotMemoryProfile& profile) {\n    uint64_t usage\
      \ = profile.GetTotalUsage();\n    if (usage > MAX_ALLOWED_MEMORY) {\n      \
      \  LOG_WARN(\"Bot memory usage exceeds limit: %llu bytes\", usage);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear scan of all internal entries to calculate the
    total memory footprint. For profiles with a large number of entries, performance
    may be impacted. The calculation includes both data payload and internal overhead
    such as entry headers and tracking information.
  warnings: The returned value reflects current memory usage at the time of invocation
    and may change dynamically if the profile is modified after calling this method.
    Do not rely on cached values from previous calls without re-invoking the method.
