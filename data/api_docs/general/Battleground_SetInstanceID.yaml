  class: Battleground
  method: SetInstanceID
  signature: void Battleground::SetInstanceID(int InstanceID)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the instance identifier for the battleground.
  description: The SetInstanceID method assigns a unique instance identifier to a
    battleground, which is used to track and manage multiple instances of the same
    battleground type. This identifier is crucial for handling player entry, exit,
    and state management within the game world. The method typically updates internal
    tracking structures that associate the battleground with its specific instance
    in the server's memory. It is commonly called during battleground initialization
    or when a new instance needs to be created.
  parameters:
  - name: InstanceID
    description: The unique identifier for the battleground instance. This value should
      be a positive integer representing the instance ID, typically generated by the
      server's instance management system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Instance ID during Battleground Creation
    code: 'Battleground* bg = new Battleground();

      bg->SetInstanceID(12345);

      // The battleground now has instance ID 12345 assigned'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Instance ID for Existing Battleground
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(54321);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->SetInstanceID(98765);\n}\n// The existing battleground instance is\
      \ now updated with new ID"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state variables of the Battleground
    object. It should only be called when the battleground is in a valid initialization
    or transition state. The instance ID must be unique within the server's context
    to prevent conflicts.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already active battleground may cause unexpected
    behavior or state corruption. Ensure that the instance ID being set is valid and
    not already in use by another battleground instance.
