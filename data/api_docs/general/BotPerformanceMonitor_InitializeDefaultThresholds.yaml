  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::InitializeDefaultThresholds()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes default performance thresholds for bot monitoring.
  description: The InitializeDefaultThresholds method sets up predefined performance
    metrics and limits used by the BotPerformanceMonitor to evaluate and track bot
    behavior. This method establishes baseline values for various performance indicators
    such as update frequency, resource usage, and response times that are critical
    for maintaining optimal gameplay experience and detecting potential abuse or malfunctioning
    bots. The thresholds are typically configured based on World of Warcraft's expected
    performance standards and TrinityCore's server capabilities.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.InitializeDefaultThresholds();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during system initialization or when
    a new performance monitor instance is created. It's designed to be called once
    to set up default values and does not need to be invoked repeatedly unless custom
    thresholds are required.
