  class: Creature
  method: SetInteractionAllowedInCombat
  signature: void Creature::SetInteractionAllowedInCombat(bool interactionAllowed)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether creature interaction is allowed during combat.
  description: This method controls whether a creature can be interacted with while
    in combat. When set to true, the creature allows interaction even while engaged
    in combat; when set to false, the creature will not allow interaction during combat.
    This is useful for controlling NPC behavior during battle scenarios and preventing
    unwanted interactions with combat-locked creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: interactionAllowed
    description: A boolean value indicating whether interaction should be allowed
      during combat. True enables interaction, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetInteractionAllowedInCombat(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nif (creature)\n{\n    creature->SetInteractionAllowedInCombat(false);\n\
      \    // Creature will not allow interaction during combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the creature's behavior in combat and should be used
    carefully to avoid unexpected interactions. The setting persists until changed
    explicitly.
  warnings: Setting this incorrectly may cause creatures to become uninteractable
    during combat, leading to game-breaking situations where players cannot interact
    with NPCs.
