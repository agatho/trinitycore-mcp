documentation:
  brief: Processes quest push result packets from the client to update quest status
    and notify players of quest-related events.
  description: The HandleQuestPushResult method is responsible for processing incoming
    quest push result packets sent by the client. These packets typically contain
    information about quest acceptance, completion, or other quest-related actions
    initiated by the player. The method validates the packet data, updates internal
    quest state, and may send appropriate responses back to the client. This method
    plays a crucial role in maintaining synchronization between the client's quest
    interface and the server's quest tracking system, ensuring that players receive
    accurate feedback when interacting with quests.

  - title: Basic packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQuestPushResult(WorldPackets::Quest::QuestPushResult&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process quest result based on packet data\n    if (packet.Result\
      \ == QUEST_PUSH_ACCEPTED)\n        SendQuestPushResult(packet.QuestID, packet.Result);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the WorldSession's packet handling
    pipeline. It should be called only when a valid quest push result packet is received
    from a connected client. The method assumes proper packet validation has already
    occurred in earlier stages of processing.
