  class: QuestProgressData
  method: QuestProgressData
  signature: void QuestProgressData::QuestProgressData(uint32 qId, uint32 bGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a QuestProgressData object with the specified quest ID and broadcast
    GUID.
  description: The QuestProgressData constructor initializes an instance of the QuestProgressData
    class using a provided quest identifier and broadcast GUID. This class is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to track and manage quest progress data
    for players. The initialization process sets up internal state variables that
    associate the quest with a specific broadcast identifier, which may be used for
    network synchronization or event handling purposes in the game world. The constructor
    does not perform any validation on the input parameters, so it's expected that
    valid values are passed to ensure proper functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: qId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being initialized. This value
      should correspond to a valid quest entry in the game database.
  - name: bGuid
    description: The broadcast GUID associated with this quest progress data. This
      identifier is typically used for network communication and synchronization between
      server and client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic QuestProgressData Initialization
    code: 'QuestProgressData progress(12345, 67890);

      // Initializes a new QuestProgressData object for quest ID 12345 with broadcast
      GUID 67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using QuestProgressData in Player Context
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 questId = player->GetQuestStatus(12345);

      uint32 broadcastGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      QuestProgressData progress(questId, broadcastGuid);

      // Creates a QuestProgressData object for tracking a specific player''s quest
      progress'
    language: cpp
  notes: The QuestProgressData class appears to be part of the internal quest management
    system in TrinityCore. The constructor does not perform any database lookups or
    validation, so it's assumed that the parameters passed are already validated.
    This class may be used in conjunction with other quest-related classes such as
    QuestStatus or QuestLogEntry for comprehensive quest tracking.
  warnings: Since this is a constructor, calling it without proper parameter validation
    might lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that qId corresponds to an existing quest
    and bGuid is a valid identifier before passing them to the constructor.
