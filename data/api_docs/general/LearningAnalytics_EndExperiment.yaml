    successful)
documentation:
  brief: Ends a learning experiment and records its outcome in the analytics system.
  description: The EndExperiment method finalizes a learning experiment by logging
    its completion status. It takes the name of the experiment and a boolean flag
    indicating whether the experiment was successful. This method is typically used
    to track the results of experimental features or gameplay mechanics within the
    TrinityCore framework. The method does not return any value but may trigger internal
    analytics reporting mechanisms. It's expected that this method be called after
    an experiment has been initialized and is ready for finalization.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier or name of the experiment to end. This string
      should match a previously started experiment.
  - name: successful
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the experiment completed successfully
      (true) or failed (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Ending a Successful Experiment
    code: LearningAnalytics::EndExperiment("new_spell_tuning", true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Ending a Failed Experiment
    code: LearningAnalytics::EndExperiment("raid_difficulty_scaling", false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the learning analytics system and likely integrates
    with TrinityCore's data collection infrastructure. It may be used for A/B testing,
    feature rollouts, or performance monitoring of gameplay elements.
