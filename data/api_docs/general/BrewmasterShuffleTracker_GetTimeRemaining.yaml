  class: BrewmasterShuffleTracker
  method: GetTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 BrewmasterShuffleTracker::GetTimeRemaining() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for the Brewmaster Shuffle effect.
  description: The GetTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration left on the Brewmaster
    Shuffle buff, which is a talent from the Brewmaster specialization in World of
    Warcraft. This value represents how much time is left before the effect expires.
    The returned value is expressed in milliseconds and can be used to determine when
    the shuffle effect will end or to calculate cooldowns and timing for subsequent
    abilities. The method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call at
    any time during the effect's duration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the remaining time in milliseconds for the
    Brewmaster Shuffle effect. Returns 0 if the effect is not active or has expired.
  examples:
  - title: Check Remaining Time Before Using Shuffle
    code: "if (BrewmasterShuffleTracker* tracker = player->GetBrewmasterShuffleTracker())\
      \ {\n    uint32 remaining = tracker->GetTimeRemaining();\n    if (remaining\
      \ > 5000) // More than 5 seconds left\n        DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the existence of a BrewmasterShuffleTracker instance
    associated with the player. The returned time is typically updated by the game's
    internal timer system and may be affected by effects that modify spell durations
    or haste.
