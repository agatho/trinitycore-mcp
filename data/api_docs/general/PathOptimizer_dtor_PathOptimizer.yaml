documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PathOptimizer instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The PathOptimizer destructor is responsible for cleaning up any dynamically
    allocated memory or resources used by the PathOptimizer object. This method is
    automatically called when a PathOptimizer instance goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. It ensures proper resource deallocation to prevent memory leaks within
    the TrinityCore server environment. The destructor typically handles cleanup of
    internal pathfinding data structures, temporary buffers, and any other resources
    that may have been allocated during the object's lifetime.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PathOptimizer
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    PathOptimizer optimizer;\n    // ... use optimizer\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when optimizer goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of PathOptimizer
    code: 'PathOptimizer* optimizer = new PathOptimizer();

      // ... use optimizer ...

      delete optimizer; // Calls destructor explicitly'
    language: cpp
  notes: The PathOptimizer destructor is implemented as a virtual function to ensure
    proper cleanup when the object is destroyed through a base class pointer. This
    is standard practice in C++ for classes that are intended to be inherited from,
    ensuring that derived class destructors are called correctly.
