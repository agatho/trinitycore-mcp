  method: IsDungeon
  signature: bool Map::IsDungeon() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is a dungeon type instance.
  description: This method checks if the map object represents a dungeon or raid instance,
    returning true if the map is classified as a dungeon and false otherwise. It is
    commonly used to distinguish between different types of game content such as dungeons,
    raids, and world areas. The method is particularly useful for determining whether
    special dungeon mechanics apply to the current map, such as unique spawn rules,
    loot distribution methods, or instance-specific events. This functionality is
    essential for proper game logic implementation when dealing with instance-based
    content.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is a dungeon type instance, false otherwise. The
    method returns false for non-dungeon maps such as world areas, battlegrounds,
    or arenas.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (map->IsDungeon())\n{\n    // Handle dungeon-specific logic\n    //\
      \ e.g., special loot rules, unique spawn conditions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "bool isDungeon = map->IsDungeon();\nif (isDungeon)\n{\n    // Apply dungeon-specific\
      \ mechanics\n    // e.g., instance reset logic, special event handling\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Handle regular world map logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is implemented using internal map flags and classification data.
    It may not be available in all contexts depending on the map's type and structure.
    Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a map is a raid instance,
    as it only returns true for dungeons. For raid detection, use IsRaid() instead.
