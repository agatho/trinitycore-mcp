  class: Quest
  method: IsTakingQuestEnabled
  signature: bool Quest::IsTakingQuestEnabled(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific quest is enabled for taking by the player.
  description: The IsTakingQuestEnabled method checks if a quest is available for
    acceptance by the player, considering factors such as quest prerequisites, player
    level requirements, and quest completion status. This method is crucial for determining
    quest availability in the game's quest system and helps ensure that players can
    only take quests they are eligible for. The method returns true when the quest
    can be accepted and false when it cannot, making it essential for quest handling
    logic in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is enabled for taking by the player, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that the quest either has unmet prerequisites,
    is not at the correct level, or has already been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Enablement Check
    code: "bool canTakeQuest = quest->IsTakingQuestEnabled(12345);\nif (canTakeQuest)\n\
      {\n    // Quest is available for taking\n    // Proceed with quest acceptance\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks against player level requirements, quest prerequisites,
    and completion status. It may also consider faction requirements and other game
    mechanics that affect quest availability. Performance-wise, this method should
    be used judiciously as it involves multiple checks.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may not account for all
    possible quest conditions. Some quests might have additional restrictions beyond
    what this method checks, such as faction requirements or specific item requirements
    that could prevent quest acceptance even if the method returns true.
