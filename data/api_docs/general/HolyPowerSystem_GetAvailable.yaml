  class: HolyPowerSystem
  method: GetAvailable
  signature: uint32 HolyPowerSystem::GetAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current amount of available holy power stored in the HolyPowerSystem.
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the total quantity of holy power
    currently available within the HolyPowerSystem. This value represents the accumulation
    of holy power that can be used for abilities or effects, typically managed by
    the system's internal tracking mechanisms. The returned value is usually constrained
    to a specific maximum limit defined by the game mechanics, and may be influenced
    by player class, talents, and active buffs or debuffs. This method does not modify
    any state within the system; it only provides a read-only view of the current
    holy power count.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the amount of holy power currently available
    in the system. The value is typically non-negative and bounded by the maximum
    holy power capacity, which varies based on class and game context (e.g., 5 for
    most classes, or higher with certain talents).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 availablePower = holyPowerSystem.GetAvailable();\nif (availablePower\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use holy power for an ability\n    std::cout << \"Available\
      \ holy power: \" << availablePower << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Power Before Spending
    code: "if (holyPowerSystem.GetAvailable() >= 3)\n{\n    // Spend 3 holy power\
      \ to cast a spell\n    // Implementation logic here\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Not\
      \ enough power, handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other HolyPowerSystem methods
    such as Add(), Spend(), and Set() to manage holy power state. It's important to
    note that the returned value reflects only the current available power, not the
    total accumulated or maximum possible power.
  warnings: Ensure that any logic depending on this value accounts for potential race
    conditions if multiple threads may modify the HolyPowerSystem concurrently. Also,
    be aware that some game systems might temporarily restrict holy power usage even
    when the system reports availability.
