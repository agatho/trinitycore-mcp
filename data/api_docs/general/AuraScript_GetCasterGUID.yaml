  signature: int AuraScript::GetCasterGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the aura's caster.
  description: The GetCasterGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier of
    the unit that applied the aura. This GUID is used throughout TrinityCore to uniquely
    identify game objects, players, and creatures. The returned value represents the
    caster's GUID in the form of an integer, which can be used to perform lookups
    or comparisons against other GUIDs. This method is commonly used within AuraScript
    implementations to determine the source of an aura effect for conditional logic
    or interaction handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the aura's caster. If the aura has
    no caster (e.g., in certain scripted scenarios), this may return 0 or an invalid
    GUID value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to compare caster GUID
    code: "if (GetCasterGUID() == GetUnit()->GetGUID())\n{\n    // The aura was cast\
      \ by the same unit that triggered it\n    // Perform specific logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using caster GUID to find the caster object
    code: "Unit* caster = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*GetUnit(), GetCasterGUID());\n\
      if (caster)\n{\n    // Use the caster object for further processing\n    //\
      \ e.g., check caster's health, faction, etc.\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns an integer representation of a GUID. In TrinityCore, GUIDs
    are typically stored as uint64_t values internally but are cast to int for compatibility
    in AuraScript. The returned value is valid only during the execution context of
    the aura script and should not be cached across multiple ticks or events.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method outside of an active aura script context,
    as it may return invalid data if called at inappropriate times. Also note that
    some auras may have no caster (e.g., those applied by environment effects), so
    always validate the returned GUID before using it in lookups.
