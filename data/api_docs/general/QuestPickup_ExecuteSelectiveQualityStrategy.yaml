  brief: Executes a quality selection strategy for quest pickup based on player bot's
    criteria.
  description: The ExecuteSelectiveQualityStrategy method determines and applies an
    appropriate quality selection logic when a player bot picks up quests. This method
    evaluates various factors such as quest difficulty, player level, available rewards,
    and bot-specific settings to decide which quest items or rewards should be prioritized.
    It ensures that the bot selects the most beneficial quest qualities according
    to its configured strategy, enhancing gameplay efficiency and resource allocation
    within the TrinityCore framework.

  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the quality selection strategy for quest pickup. Must not be null.

  notes: This method is typically invoked during automated quest handling processes
    in AI-driven bots. It relies on internal bot configuration settings and may interact
    with the player's inventory to determine optimal quality selections.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and initialized before
    calling this method, as passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior
    or crashes.
