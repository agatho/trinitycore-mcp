  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: Update
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the market analysis data based on the elapsed time since last update.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and refreshing market
    analysis data within the TrinityCore framework. It typically handles periodic
    tasks such as recalculating item prices, updating auction house statistics, or
    adjusting market trends based on the time delta provided. This method is commonly
    called from the main game loop to ensure that market conditions remain current
    and responsive to in-game events. The implementation likely involves iterating
    through market data structures, applying time-based calculations, and potentially
    triggering notifications or updates to connected clients.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      uint32 diff = 1000; // 1 second since last update

      analysis.Update(diff);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other game updates...\n\
      \    marketAnalysis.Update(diff);\n    // Other game updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game update loop. The
    'diff' parameter represents milliseconds elapsed since last call, which is crucial
    for accurate time-based calculations. Performance considerations include avoiding
    heavy computations within this method to prevent frame rate drops.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid time deltas (e.g., negative values)
    as it may cause unexpected behavior in market calculations. Ensure that the method
    is thread-safe if called from multiple contexts.
