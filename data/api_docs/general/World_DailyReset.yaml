  brief: Resets daily quest and achievement progress for all online players
  description: The DailyReset method performs a comprehensive reset of all daily quest
    progress, daily achievements, and related player data that resets on a daily basis.
    This method is typically invoked during the server's daily maintenance cycle to
    ensure all players start fresh with their daily objectives. The method iterates
    through all currently connected players and clears their daily quest counters,
    resets daily achievement progress, and updates relevant player data structures.
    It ensures consistency across the game world by synchronizing all daily reset
    operations in a controlled manner.

  notes: This method should only be called during scheduled maintenance windows or
    server reset cycles to avoid disrupting active players. The implementation may
    involve database transactions and player state updates that could impact performance
    during high-traffic periods.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are actively engaged in daily quests
    may result in loss of progress or inconsistent achievement states. Always ensure
    proper synchronization with the game's time system before invoking this method.
