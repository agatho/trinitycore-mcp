documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's GM chat status to enable or disable game master chat functionality.
  description: The SetGMChat method toggles the player's ability to receive and send
    messages through the Game Master chat system. When enabled, the player can communicate
    with Game Masters using special chat channels that are typically reserved for
    administrative purposes. This method affects the player's chat behavior and is
    commonly used during GM operations or when setting up player accounts for administrative
    access. The method does not require any parameters and simply changes the internal
    state of the player's chat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetGMChat(true);

      // Player now has GM chat enabled'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetGMChat(false);

      // Player now has GM chat disabled

      // This would typically be used in conjunction with other GM-related methods'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely modifies internal flags or state
    variables within the player object that control chat channel access. Performance
    considerations: No significant performance impact as it simply toggles a flag.
    Thread safety: This method should be thread-safe if used correctly, though it
    may require synchronization in multi-threaded environments.'
  warnings: 'Common mistake: Forgetting to check whether the player is actually a
    GM before calling this method. Dangerous edge case: If called on non-GM players,
    it may have unintended consequences for chat system behavior or could be ignored
    by the game server.'
