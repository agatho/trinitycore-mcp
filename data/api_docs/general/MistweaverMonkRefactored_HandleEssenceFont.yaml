  class: MistweaverMonkRefactored
  method: HandleEssenceFont
  signature: bool MistweaverMonkRefactored::HandleEssenceFont(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Essence Font ability to a specified group member, healing them
    and potentially generating additional effects.
  description: The HandleEssenceFont method implements the core logic for the Mistweaver
    Monk's Essence Font spell. This ability heals a target or group of targets with
    a burst of healing energy that can also generate additional healing effects through
    various mechanics such as Chi generation or stacking effects. The method takes
    a group identifier parameter to determine which group members should receive the
    healing effect. It returns true if the spell was successfully cast and applied,
    false otherwise. This method is typically called during combat when the player
    has sufficient resources (such as Chi) to cast the ability.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group members will receive
      the Essence Font healing effect. Valid values are typically 0-4 representing
      different group types or targets, with -1 often indicating self-targeting or
      a special case.
  returns: Returns true if the Essence Font spell was successfully cast and applied
    to the target(s), false if the spell failed to execute due to insufficient resources,
    invalid targeting, or other conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with group targeting
    code: "if (player->GetClass() == CLASS_MONK) {\n    MistweaverMonkRefactored*\
      \ monk = static_cast<MistweaverMonkRefactored*>(player);\n    bool success =\
      \ monk->HandleEssenceFont(1); // Target group 1\n    if (success) {\n      \
      \  // Essence Font applied successfully\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with error handling
    code: "MistweaverMonkRefactored* monk = dynamic_cast<MistweaverMonkRefactored*>(player);\n\
      if (monk && player->GetPower(POWER_CHI) >= 10) {\n    bool result = monk->HandleEssenceFont(0);\
      \ // Target group 0\n    if (!result) {\n        // Handle failed cast\n   \
      \     player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough resources to cast Essence Font.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's resource system (Chi), target
    selection logic, and healing calculations. The group parameter may influence which
    targets are affected by the spell and how the healing is distributed. Implementation
    details may include checks for valid targets, resource consumption, and application
    of any stacking or buff effects.
  warnings: Ensure that the player has sufficient Chi resources before calling this
    method, as failure to do so may result in silent failures or incorrect behavior.
    The group parameter should be validated to prevent invalid target selections which
    could cause undefined behavior or crashes.
