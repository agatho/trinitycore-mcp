api:
  class: WorldSession
  method: SetRealmListSecret
  signature: void WorldSession::SetRealmListSecret(const std::array<uint8, 32> & secret)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the secret key used for authenticating realm list requests in the WorldSession.
  description: The SetRealmListSecret method assigns a 32-byte secret key to the current
    WorldSession, which is utilized during realm list authentication processes. This
    secret is typically used by the client to verify the authenticity of realm list
    data received from the server. The method does not perform any validation on the
    input secret and simply stores it within the session context for later use in
    cryptographic operations related to realm listing. It's commonly invoked during
    the login process or when establishing secure communication channels with the
    authentication servers.
  parameters:
  - name: secret
    description: A 32-element array of uint8 values representing the secret key used
      for realm list authentication. This key must be exactly 32 bytes in length and
      typically contains cryptographic material used to sign or verify realm list
      data.
  returns: null

    code: 'std::array<uint8, 32> secretKey = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06,

      worldSession->SetRealmListSecret(secretKey);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during session initialization or authentication
    phases. The secret key should be securely generated and managed to prevent unauthorized
    access to realm list data. The stored secret may be used in conjunction with other
    cryptographic functions such as HMAC or digital signatures for realm list integrity
    verification.
