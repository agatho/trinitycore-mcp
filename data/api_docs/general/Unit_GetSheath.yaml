  signature: SheathState Unit::GetSheath() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current sheath state of the unit, indicating whether the unit
    is wielding a weapon or not.
  description: The GetSheath method retrieves the current sheath state of a Unit object,
    which represents the state of the weapon being wielded by the unit. This method
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine if
    a unit has a weapon equipped and whether it is in a sheathed or unsheathed state.
    The sheath state can be used for various game mechanics including combat behavior,
    animation states, and visual representation of weapons. This method does not modify
    any state but simply returns the current value stored in the unit's internal data
    structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SheathState enum value that indicates the current sheath status
    of the unit. Possible values include SHEATH_STATE_UNARMED, SHEATH_STATE_MELEE,
    and SHEATH_STATE ranged. The specific values depend on the unit's weapon state
    and can affect animations and combat behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "SheathState state = unit->GetSheath();\nif (state == SHEATH_STATE_MELEE)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is wielding a melee weapon\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other weapon-related methods
    to determine the current state of a unit's weapon. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this is simply a getter method that returns stored data. Thread
    safety is generally not an issue for this method as it does not modify any state.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combat situations, as incorrect
    interpretation of the sheath state can lead to incorrect animation or behavior
    during combat. The method may return different values depending on whether the
    unit is in combat or not.
