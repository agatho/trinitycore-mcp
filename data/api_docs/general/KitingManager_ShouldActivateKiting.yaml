  class: KitingManager
  method: ShouldActivateKiting
  signature: bool KitingManager::ShouldActivateKiting(const KitingContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether kiting behavior should be activated based on the provided
    kiting context.
  description: The ShouldActivateKiting method evaluates the current kiting context
    to decide if the kiting behavior should be enabled. This decision is typically
    based on factors such as player position, target distance, available mana, and
    combat state. The method serves as a core decision point in the AI logic for determining
    when a character should engage in kiting mechanics, which involves maintaining
    distance from an enemy while dealing damage or healing. It ensures that kiting
    actions are only initiated when conditions are favorable to avoid unnecessary
    resource expenditure or tactical disadvantage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if kiting behavior should be activated according to the provided
    context; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "KitingContext context;\n// ... populate context with relevant data ...\n\
      bool activate = kitingManager.ShouldActivateKiting(context);\nif (activate)\n\
      {\n    // Initiate kiting behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to make real-time
    decisions about kiting. It's important to ensure that the KitingContext passed
    to this method contains accurate and up-to-date information for proper decision
    making.
