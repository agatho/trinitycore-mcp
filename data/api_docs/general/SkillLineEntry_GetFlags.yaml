documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with a skill line entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitwise
    flags that define various properties and behaviors of a skill line in the TrinityCore
    database. These flags are typically used to determine how a skill behaves within
    the game, such as whether it's trainable, if it has specific restrictions, or
    if it's related to certain categories like professions or talents. The returned
    value should be interpreted using bitwise operations to check for individual flag
    states. This method is commonly used in skill management systems and player progression
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flag bits for the skill line entry.
    Each bit corresponds to a specific property or behavior of the skill, such as
    being trainable, having a maximum value, or belonging to a particular category.
    The exact meaning of each bit must be determined by referencing the skill line
    flag definitions in the TrinityCore codebase or database schema.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a skill is trainable
    code: "SkillLineEntry* entry = sSkillLineStore.LookupEntry(skillLineId);\nif (entry)\
      \ {\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & SKILL_FLAG_TRAINABLE)\
      \ {\n        // Skill can be trained by players\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining skill category through flag inspection
    code: "SkillLineEntry* entry = sSkillLineStore.LookupEntry(skillLineId);\nif (entry)\
      \ {\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & SKILL_FLAG_PROFESSION)\n\
      \        printf(\"This is a profession skill\\n\");\n    else if (flags & SKILL_FLAG_TALENT)\n\
      \        printf(\"This is a talent skill\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are defined in the database schema and
    may vary between different versions of TrinityCore. Developers should consult
    the relevant flag definitions in the codebase to properly interpret the meaning
    of each bit. The method itself is a simple getter and does not perform any complex
    operations, making it safe for frequent calls.
  warnings: Incorrect bitwise operations when checking flags can lead to unexpected
    behavior. Always ensure that you're using the correct flag constants defined in
    the TrinityCore codebase. Be cautious when modifying or relying on undocumented
    flag meanings as they may change between core versions.
