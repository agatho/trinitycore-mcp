  class: CalendarEvent
  method: GetDescription
  signature: std::string CalendarEvent::GetDescription() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the description text associated with a calendar event.
  description: The GetDescription method returns the textual description of a calendar
    event. This description is typically set when the event is created and may contain
    details about the event's purpose, location, or other relevant information. The
    returned string is a copy of the internal description stored within the CalendarEvent
    object. This method does not modify any state in the calendar event and can be
    called safely from any thread that has access to the CalendarEvent instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the description text of the calendar event. If
    no description was set, an empty string is returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Event Description
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    std::string description = event->GetDescription();\n    if (!description.empty())\n\
      \    {\n        printf(\"Event Description: %s\\n\", description.c_str());\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        printf(\"No description available for this\
      \ event.\\n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Description in UI Context
    code: "void DisplayEventDetails(CalendarEvent* event)\n{\n    std::string desc\
      \ = event->GetDescription();\n    if (!desc.empty())\n    {\n        // Display\
      \ description in tooltip or event panel\n        SendSystemMessageToPlayer(player,\
      \ \"Description: \" + desc);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        SendSystemMessageToPlayer(player,\
      \ \"No additional details for this event.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a shallow copy of the internal description string. The
    returned string is independent of the internal storage and can be modified without
    affecting the original event data. The method is marked as const, indicating it
    does not alter the object's state.
