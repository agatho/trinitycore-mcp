api:
  class: SpellInfo
  method: GetAllEffectsMechanicMask
  signature: uint64 SpellInfo::GetAllEffectsMechanicMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a bitmask representing all mechanic types associated with spell effects.
  description: This method retrieves the combined mechanic mask for all effects within
    the spell, allowing developers to identify which mechanical types are affected
    by the spell. The returned value is a uint64 that encodes the union of all individual
    effect mechanic masks, providing insight into the spell's impact on various game
    mechanics such as stun, root, silence, and others. This functionality is essential
    for determining spell interactions and effects in the context of World of Warcraft
    gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the combined mechanic mask of all spell
    effects, where each bit corresponds to a specific mechanic type (e.g., 0x1 for
    stun, 0x2 for root, etc.).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint64 mechanicMask = spellInfo->GetAllEffectsMechanicMask();\nif (mechanicMask\
      \ & 0x1)\n{\n    // Check if spell has stun effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related APIs
    to determine comprehensive spell mechanics. Performance-wise, it's a lightweight
    operation that doesn't involve any complex calculations or database queries.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking for specific mechanic
    types, as bitwise operations may lead to incorrect assumptions if not properly
    handled. Also, the returned mask might include multiple mechanics simultaneously,
    so developers should ensure proper bit manipulation.
