  class: AuctionHouse
  method: AdaptAuctionBehavior
  signature: void AuctionHouse::AdaptAuctionBehavior(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts auction house behavior based on player interaction and game state.
  description: The AdaptAuctionBehavior method modifies the auction house's operational
    parameters and user interface dynamically in response to player actions or system
    conditions. This method likely adjusts item listings, pricing strategies, or display
    settings to optimize the auction experience for the specified player. It may also
    handle dynamic updates such as when a player logs in, makes a bid, or when auction
    house inventory changes. The behavior adjustment could include filtering options,
    recommended bids, or localized auction house settings based on the player's current
    game context.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) whose
      auction behavior will be adapted. This parameter is used to determine which
      player's specific preferences and state should influence the auction house behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionHouse auctionHouse;

      auctionHouse.AdaptAuctionBehavior(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Login
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    auctionHouse.AdaptAuctionBehavior(&playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked internally by the auction house system upon
    player interaction. It may be part of a larger behavior adaptation framework that
    adjusts game mechanics based on player data or server state. The method signature
    suggests it modifies behavior rather than returning a value, implying side effects
    in the auction house system.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an active player
    before calling this method. Passing an invalid or uninitialized player ID may
    result in undefined behavior or system instability.
