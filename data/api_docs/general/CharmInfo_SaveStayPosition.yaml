documentation:
  brief: Saves the current position of a charmed unit for later reference or restoration.
  description: The SaveStayPosition method in the CharmInfo class is responsible for
    recording the current location of a charmed creature or player. This functionality
    is typically used when a unit is under the effect of a charm spell, and it's important
    to maintain their position so that they can be returned to that spot if needed.
    The saved position is often used in conjunction with other charm-related behaviors
    such as staying near the charmer or returning to a specific location after being
    commanded to move. This method does not perform any validation on the current
    state of the charmed unit, and it assumes that the unit is indeed charmed and
    has a valid position to save.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Saving Position of a Charmed Creature
    code: "void ExampleFunction(Unit* charmedUnit)\n{\n    if (charmedUnit->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CHARMED))\n\
      \    {\n        CharmInfo* charmInfo = charmedUnit->GetCharmInfo();\n      \
      \  if (charmInfo)\n        {\n            charmInfo->SaveStayPosition();\n \
      \       }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core when a charmed unit's
    position needs to be preserved. It may be used in scenarios where the charmer
    wants to ensure that their pet or minion returns to a specific location after
    being commanded to move elsewhere. The saved position is usually stored within
    the CharmInfo object and can be retrieved using related methods such as GetStayPosition().
  warnings: This method should only be called when the unit is actually charmed, otherwise
    it may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect positioning data. It's important
    to verify that the CharmInfo object exists before calling this method.
