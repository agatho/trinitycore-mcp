  class: AuctionManager
  method: GetAuctionHouseIdForBot
  signature: uint32 AuctionManager::GetAuctionHouseIdForBot(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction house ID associated with a specific bot player.
  description: The GetAuctionHouseIdForBot method is used to determine the auction
    house identifier that is linked to a given bot player within the TrinityCore framework.
    This functionality is essential for bots that participate in auction house activities,
    such as buying or selling items. The method likely retrieves this information
    from internal data structures or configuration mappings associated with the bot's
    player entry. It assumes that the provided bot player has been properly initialized
    and registered within the game system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the auction
      house ID is being retrieved. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the auction house ID associated with
    the specified bot player. If no valid auction house is assigned, it may return
    0 or another default identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player\nuint32 ahId\
      \ = sAuctionMgr->GetAuctionHouseIdForBot(myBot);\nif (ahId != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Proceed with auction house operations using ahId\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal mappings or stored data about bot configurations.
    Ensure that the Player object passed is valid and represents an actual bot, not
    a regular player character.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will result in undefined behavior.
    Always validate that the input Player pointer refers to a legitimate bot before
    calling this function.
