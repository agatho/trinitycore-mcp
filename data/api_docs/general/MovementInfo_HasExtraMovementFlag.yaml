  signature: bool MovementInfo::HasExtraMovementFlag(uint32 flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific extra movement flag is set within the MovementInfo object.
  description: The HasExtraMovementFlag method determines whether a particular extra
    movement flag is currently active in the MovementInfo object. This functionality
    is essential for tracking special movement states such as flying, swimming, or
    other game-specific movement conditions that are not covered by standard movement
    flags. The method performs a bitwise check against the internal flag storage to
    verify if the specified flag is present. It's commonly used in packet handling
    and movement validation logic within TrinityCore's server-side implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified extra movement flag is set, false otherwise.
    This boolean value indicates the presence or absence of a specific movement state
    modifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flag Check
    code: "if (movementInfo.HasExtraMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_EXTRA_FLYING)) {\n    //\
      \ Handle flying movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Flag Validation
    code: "uint32 flags = MOVEFLAG_EXTRA_FLYING | MOVEFLAG_EXTRA_SWIMMING;\nif (movementInfo.HasExtraMovementFlag(flags))\
      \ {\n    // Process movement with flying and swimming states\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on internal flag storage that is typically updated through
    packet processing. Developers should be aware that the flag values are defined
    in the MovementFlags enumeration and must match exactly with expected constants.
    The implementation uses bitwise operations for performance, making it efficient
    for frequent checks during movement updates.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with undefined or custom flag values
    as they may not behave as expected. Also, ensure that the MovementInfo object
    is properly initialized before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
