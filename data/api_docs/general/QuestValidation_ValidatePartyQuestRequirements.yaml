api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidatePartyQuestRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidatePartyQuestRequirements(uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets all party quest requirements for a given
    quest ID.
  description: The ValidatePartyQuestRequirements method checks if a specified player
    (bot) satisfies all necessary conditions to participate in a party quest. This
    includes verifying that the player has the required level, quest completion status,
    and any other prerequisites defined by the quest's party requirements. The method
    ensures that party members are properly validated before allowing them to engage
    with shared quest content. It returns true if all requirements are met, false
    otherwise. This validation is crucial for maintaining game balance and ensuring
    players can only join quests they are eligible for within a group context.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate party requirements
      for. Must be a valid quest ID registered in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose party
      quest requirements are being validated. Must not be null and must represent
      an active player character.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all party quest requirements for the specified
    quest ID; otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that one
    or more validation checks failed, preventing the player from participating in
    the party quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (sQuestValidation->ValidatePartyQuestRequirements(12345, player)) {\n\
      \    // Player can join the party quest\n    player->SendQuestUpdateAddItem(12345,\
      \ 0, 1);\n} else {\n    // Player cannot participate in the quest\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements to join this party quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Checks
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nPlayer* player = session->GetPlayer();\nif (sQuestValidation->ValidatePartyQuestRequirements(questId,\
      \ player)) {\n    // Additional checks for group members\n    Group* group =\
      \ player->GetGroup();\n    if (group) {\n        for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator\
      \ itr = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n             itr != group->GetMemberSlots().end();\
      \ ++itr)\n        {\n            Player* member = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n\
      \            if (member && !sQuestValidation->ValidatePartyQuestRequirements(questId,\
      \ member)) {\n                player->SendNotification(\"Not all group members\
      \ meet the quest requirements.\");\n                return;\n            }\n\
      \        }\n    }\n    // Proceed with quest initiation\n}\nelse {\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the party quest requirements.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs multiple checks including level validation, quest completion
    status, and any custom party-specific conditions defined in the quest template.
    It is designed to be efficient and should not cause significant performance impact
    during normal gameplay operations. The method assumes that the player object passed
    is valid and represents an active character.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer will likely result in a crash or undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that quest IDs must exist in the database; invalid quest IDs may
    lead to unexpected validation results or errors.
