documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AzeriteItem instance with default values.
  description: The AzeriteItem constructor initializes a new instance of the AzeriteItem
    class, setting up internal data structures and default state values for an azerite
    item. This method is typically called when creating a new azerite item object,
    either from scratch or when loading an existing one from the database. The constructor
    ensures that all member variables are properly initialized to their default states,
    including azerite level, powers, and other relevant properties. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this constructor is essential for managing
    azerite items which are special gear items with unique abilities and progression
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AzeriteItem instance
    code: 'AzeriteItem* newItem = new AzeriteItem();

      // The newItem is now initialized with default values

      // and can be used for further operations like setting azerite level or powers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any database operations or load existing
    data. It only initializes the object's internal state. When working with existing
    azerite items in the game world, additional methods like LoadFromDB() or similar
    loading functions would be required to populate the item with actual data from
    the database.
