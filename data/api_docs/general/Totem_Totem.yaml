  method: Totem
  signature: void Totem::Totem(const int * properties, int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a totem object with specified properties and owner.
  description: The Totem method serves as a constructor or initialization function
    for totem objects within the TrinityCore framework. It sets up the internal state
    of a totem based on provided properties and assigns an owner to it. This method
    is typically invoked during the creation or spawning of totems in the game world,
    such as those summoned by shaman players using totem spells. The properties parameter
    defines various attributes of the totem including its type, duration, and effects,
    while the owner parameter references the player or creature that summoned the
    totem. This initialization is crucial for proper gameplay mechanics and ensures
    that totems behave correctly within the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: properties
    description: Pointer to an array of integers defining totem properties such as
      type, duration, and effects. The exact structure and meaning of these values
      depend on the totem implementation and game mechanics.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the GUID or identifier of the
      creature or player that owns this totem. This establishes the relationship between
      the summoner and the summoned totem.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Totem Initialization
    code: 'int totemProperties[] = {1, 300, 5};

      int ownerGUID = 12345;

      Totem* myTotem = new Totem();

      myTotem->Totem(totemProperties, &ownerGUID);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing a Fire Totem
    code: 'int fireTotemProps[] = {2, 180, 10};

      int shamanGUID = player->GetGUID();

      Totem* fireTotem = new Totem();

      fireTotem->Totem(fireTotemProps, &shamanGUID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal totem management system and should not
    be called directly by most game code. It's typically invoked through higher-level
    APIs like Spell::EffectSummonTotem or similar spell handling functions. The properties
    array format may vary depending on the specific totem type being created.
  warnings: Incorrectly formatted properties arrays can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the owner parameter points to a valid creature or player
    GUID, otherwise the totem may not function properly in the game world.
