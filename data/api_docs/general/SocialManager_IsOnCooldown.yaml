  class: SocialManager
  method: IsOnCooldown
  signature: bool SocialManager::IsOnCooldown(const std::string & trigger) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified social trigger is currently on cooldown for the player.
  description: The IsOnCooldown method determines whether a given social interaction
    trigger (such as sending a whisper, adding a friend, or sending a mail) is currently
    restricted due to cooldown restrictions. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with social system mechanics in TrinityCore to prevent spamming or abuse of social
    features. It evaluates the internal cooldown state associated with the provided
    trigger string and returns true if the cooldown is active, false otherwise. The
    method does not modify any state but only reads the current cooldown status.
  parameters:
  - name: trigger
    description: A string identifier representing the social action being checked
      for cooldown. Common triggers include 'whisper', 'friend_add', 'mail_send',
      etc. This parameter defines which specific social interaction's cooldown state
      is being queried.
  returns: Returns true if the specified social trigger is currently on cooldown,
    false otherwise. A cooldown may be active due to rate limiting or game-defined
    restrictions on how frequently certain social actions can be performed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (socialManager.IsOnCooldown(\"whisper\")) {\n    // Handle cooldown\
      \ case\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot send a whisper right now.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Triggers
    code: "bool canWhisper = !socialManager.IsOnCooldown(\"whisper\");\nbool canAddFriend\
      \ = !socialManager.IsOnCooldown(\"friend_add\");\nif (canWhisper && canAddFriend)\
      \ {\n    // Both actions allowed\n    SendWhisper(\"Hello!\");\n    AddFriend(\"\
      PlayerName\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal cooldown tracking that is managed by the SocialManager
    class. Cooldowns are typically reset after a defined time interval or upon specific
    game events such as player logout/login. The trigger strings must match those
    registered with the social system to ensure accurate results.
  warnings: Ensure that the trigger string passed matches exactly with the ones used
    internally in the social system, otherwise this method may return incorrect results.
    Be cautious when using this check in performance-critical code paths since it
    involves internal state lookups.
