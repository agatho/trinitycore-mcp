  method: HandleQuestNavigation
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestNavigation(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes quest navigation logic for a bot player based on the specified
    quest ID.
  description: The HandleQuestNavigation method is responsible for managing the logical
    flow and behavior of a bot player when interacting with a specific quest. It typically
    handles quest acceptance, objective tracking, and progression within the dynamic
    quest system. This method ensures that the bot follows appropriate quest paths
    and meets requirements defined by the quest's conditions. The implementation may
    involve checking quest states, updating quest progress, and triggering relevant
    events or actions based on quest completion or failure.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will navigate
      the quest. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest to process navigation for. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Navigation Handling
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestNavigation(bot, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Multiple Quests Sequentially
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nstd::vector<uint32> questIds = {1001, 1002, 1003};\n\
      for (uint32 id : questIds)\n{\n    DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestNavigation(bot,\
      \ id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player has been properly initialized and
    is in a valid state to accept and process quests. The method does not directly
    modify the database but may trigger internal quest state changes that are persisted
    later. It's recommended to ensure that the quest ID exists in the game's quest
    database before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent questId may lead to
    undefined behavior or errors within the quest system. Always validate quest IDs
    before invoking this function. Additionally, ensure that the bot player is not
    in a state where quest processing would conflict with other active systems.
