documentation:
  brief: Detects potential exploits or abnormal behavior patterns in a player
  description: The DetectExploits method analyzes various player activities and behaviors
    to identify possible cheating attempts or exploit usage within the TrinityCore
    framework. It examines movement patterns, action timing, and interaction sequences
    to flag suspicious behavior that may indicate the use of hacks, bots, or other
    unauthorized modifications. This method is typically used as part of the server's
    anti-cheat system to maintain game integrity and fairness for all players. The
    detection process considers multiple factors including packet timing, movement
    consistency, and behavioral anomalies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the severity level or count of detected
    exploits. A return value of 0 typically indicates no exploits were detected, while
    higher values suggest increasing levels of suspicious activity or confirmed exploit
    usage. Negative values may indicate internal errors or invalid player states during
    detection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic exploit detection call
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nint exploitLevel = PlayerPatternRecognition::DetectExploits(player);\n\
      if (exploitLevel > 0) {\n    // Handle potential exploit detected\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Exploit detected in player: %s (Level: %d)\", player->GetName().c_str(), exploitLevel);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's anti-cheat infrastructure and should
    be called regularly during gameplay to monitor player behavior. The detection
    algorithm may evolve over time as new exploits are discovered and patched. Performance
    impact is generally minimal but can increase during high-traffic periods when
    multiple players are being monitored simultaneously.
  warnings: This method should not be used for punitive actions directly without additional
    verification, as false positives can occur due to legitimate gameplay variations
    or network latency. The detection results should be reviewed by human moderators
    or combined with other anti-cheat measures before taking action against players.
