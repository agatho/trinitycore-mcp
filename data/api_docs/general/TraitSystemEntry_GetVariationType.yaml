  signature: TraitSystemVariationType TraitSystemEntry::GetVariationType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the variation type associated with the trait system entry.
  description: The GetVariationType method returns the TraitSystemVariationType enum
    value that defines how the trait system entry behaves in terms of its variation.
    This is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to determine the specific
    behavior or category of a trait, such as whether it's a passive, active, or conditional
    trait. The returned value helps the game engine process trait interactions and
    apply appropriate mechanics based on the defined variation type.
  parameters: []
  returns: A TraitSystemVariationType enum value indicating the variation type of
    the trait system entry. Possible values may include types like PASSIVE, ACTIVE,
    CONDITIONAL, or other variation categories defined within the trait system implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "TraitSystemEntry* entry = sTraitSystemStore->GetEntry(12345);\nif (entry)\n\
      {\n    TraitSystemVariationType type = entry->GetVariationType();\n    // Use\
      \ the variation type to determine trait behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during trait evaluation and application logic
    within the TrinityCore framework. It's important to note that the actual enum
    values for TraitSystemVariationType are defined elsewhere in the codebase and
    may vary depending on the specific implementation or expansion.
