documentation:
  brief: Executes the dungeon strategy for the current player or creature behavior.
  description: The ExecuteDungeonStrategy method is responsible for initiating and
    managing the strategic behavior of players or creatures within a dungeon environment.
    This method typically handles pathfinding, combat decisions, loot distribution,
    and quest progression based on predefined dungeon strategies. It integrates with
    the AI system to ensure that entities follow appropriate tactical patterns during
    dungeon encounters. The method may also manage group coordination, instance-specific
    behaviors, and dynamic difficulty adjustments. Precondition for execution includes
    an active dungeon instance and valid AI configuration. Post-execution, the behavior
    manager updates internal state to reflect current strategy progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_dungeonStrategyReady)\n\
      \        m_behaviorManager.ExecuteDungeonStrategy();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Dungeon Instance
    code: "class DungeonInstance\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n\
      \    {\n        if (player->GetGroup())\n            m_behaviorManager.ExecuteDungeonStrategy();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop or instance
    event handlers. It's designed to be non-blocking and should not cause long delays
    in the game loop. The actual strategy implementation may vary based on dungeon
    type, player level, and group composition.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the behavior manager
    or dungeon context can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all required AI
    components are loaded before invoking this method.
