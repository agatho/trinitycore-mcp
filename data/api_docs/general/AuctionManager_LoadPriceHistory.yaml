api:
  class: AuctionManager
  method: LoadPriceHistory
  signature: void AuctionManager::LoadPriceHistory()
documentation:
  brief: Loads auction price history data from the database into memory for use in
    auction house functionality.
  description: The LoadPriceHistory method initializes and populates the internal
    price history cache used by the auction system. This method retrieves historical
    pricing data for items sold through the auction house, storing it in memory to
    support features like price trend analysis, bidding recommendations, and market
    value calculations. The method is typically called during server startup or when
    the auction manager needs to refresh its price history data. It ensures that the
    auction house maintains up-to-date market information without requiring real-time
    database queries for every transaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeAuctionSystem()\n{\n    AuctionManager* auctionMgr = sAuctionMgr;\n\
      \    auctionMgr->LoadPriceHistory();\n    // Price history is now loaded and\
      \ available for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database queries to fetch historical price data, which
    may cause a temporary performance impact during server startup. The loaded data
    is stored in an internal cache structure that supports fast lookups. This method
    should only be called once during the auction manager's initialization phase.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that any existing price history data
    is properly cleared before reloading.
