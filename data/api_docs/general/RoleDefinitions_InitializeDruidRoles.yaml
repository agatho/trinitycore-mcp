documentation:
  brief: Initializes the role definitions for Druid characters within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The InitializeDruidRoles method sets up and configures all necessary
    role definitions specific to Druid class abilities, talents, and gameplay mechanics
    in the TrinityCore server environment. This method is typically invoked during
    server initialization or when loading class-specific configurations to ensure
    that Druid roles are properly defined for player assignments, group dynamics,
    and encounter management. It establishes default role behaviors such as tank,
    healer, and damage dealer settings tailored for Druids, including their unique
    shapeshifting capabilities and spell rotations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'RoleDefinitions roleDefs;

      roleDefs.InitializeDruidRoles();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or class configuration
    loading. It modifies internal role state and must not be invoked concurrently
    with other role-related operations to prevent race conditions.
  warnings: Invoking this method after initial server load may lead to inconsistent
    role assignments for existing players. Ensure all active sessions are paused or
    synchronized before calling this function.
