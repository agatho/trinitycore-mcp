  class: SmartAIMgr
  method: IsAnimKitValid
  signature: bool SmartAIMgr::IsAnimKitValid(const SmartScriptHolder & e, uint32 entry)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether an animation kit entry is valid for use in SmartAI scripts.
  description: The IsAnimKitValid method checks if a given animation kit entry ID
    is valid within the context of SmartAI scripting. This validation ensures that
    the specified animation kit exists and can be safely referenced by AI scripts
    without causing runtime errors or undefined behavior. The method typically performs
    lookups against internal animation kit databases to confirm existence and proper
    configuration before allowing usage in conditional checks or script execution.
    It's commonly used during script initialization or when evaluating conditions
    that depend on valid animation kit references.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder structure containing the script
      data being validated
  - name: entry
    description: The animation kit entry ID to validate against available animation
      kits in the database
  returns: Returns true if the specified animation kit entry is valid and exists in
    the system, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that
    the animation kit ID was either not found or is improperly configured for use
    with SmartAI.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "SmartScriptHolder script;\nuint32 animKitId = 12345;\nif (sSmartAIMgr->IsAnimKitValid(script,\
      \ animKitId)) {\n    // Proceed with using the animation kit in AI logic\n \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Animation kit %u is valid.\", animKitId);\n} else {\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Invalid animation kit ID: %u\", animKitId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional AI behavior
    code: "void MyAI::OnUpdate(Unit* unit, uint32 diff) {\n    if (IsAnimKitValid(m_SmartScript,\
      \ 54321)) {\n        // Execute animation-related AI behavior\n        unit->PlayAnimationKit(54321);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Fallback behavior when animation kit is invalid\n\
      \        unit->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_IMMUNE_TO_PC);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database lookups to validate animation kit entries,
    so frequent calls may have performance implications. The validation process typically
    involves checking against internal animation kit tables and ensuring the entry
    is properly registered in the game's animation system. This method should be used
    before attempting to reference animation kits in AI scripts to prevent runtime
    errors.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or uninitialized SmartScriptHolder structures
    may lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure that the SmartScriptHolder parameter
    contains valid data before calling this method. Additionally, animation kit IDs
    that are not present in the game's database will return false, which could break
    expected AI behaviors if not properly handled.
