  signature: void Object::BuildUpdate(UpdateDataMapType & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Populates an update data map with the object's current state for network
    transmission to clients.
  description: The BuildUpdate method is responsible for constructing the update data
    structure that represents the current state of an Object instance. This method
    is typically invoked during the game loop to prepare updates for sending to connected
    clients. It iterates through the object's fields and constructs appropriate update
    packets that reflect any changes since the last update cycle. The method populates
    the provided UpdateDataMapType parameter with the necessary data to synchronize
    client-side representations with server-side state. This is a core part of TrinityCore's
    object synchronization system, ensuring that all players see consistent and up-to-date
    information about game objects.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Reference to an UpdateDataMapType container that will be populated
      with the object's update data. This parameter is modified in-place by the method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of BuildUpdate for a GameObject
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...; // Some existing game object

      UpdateDataMapType updateData;

      go->BuildUpdate(updateData);

      // updateData now contains the update information for ''go'''
    language: cpp
  - title: Using BuildUpdate in a custom update handler
    code: "void SendObjectUpdates()\n{\n    UpdateDataMapType updateData;\n    Player*\
      \ player = ...; // Some player object\n    player->BuildUpdate(updateData);\n\
      \    \n    // Process the update data for network transmission\n    for (auto&\
      \ pair : updateData)\n    {\n        // Send update packet to relevant clients\n\
      \        SendPacketToClients(pair.second);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine's update system.
    Developers should not normally call this directly unless implementing custom update
    logic. The UpdateDataMapType structure contains multiple update blocks for different
    types of data (movement, fields, etc.) which are processed separately during network
    transmission.
  warnings: Calling BuildUpdate on an object that has not been properly initialized
    or added to the world may result in incomplete or invalid update data. This method
    should only be called on objects that are actively part of the game world and
    have valid GUIDs assigned.
