  method: SetLastPetNumber
  signature: void Player::SetLastPetNumber(uint32 petnumber)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the last pet number for the player, updating the pet slot identifier.
  description: This method updates the internal tracking of the last pet number used
    by the player, which is essential for managing pet slots and ensuring proper pet
    behavior within the game mechanics. The method directly modifies the player's
    pet number storage, affecting how pets are handled in relation to their slot positions
    and identifiers. It is typically used during pet creation, deletion, or when updating
    pet slot information to maintain consistency with the game's pet management system.
  parameters:
  - name: petnumber
    description: The new pet number to set as the last pet number for this player.
      This value represents the identifier of the most recently used pet slot, typically
      ranging from 0 to 1000000.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Last Pet Number
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetLastPetNumber(5);

      // This sets the last pet number to 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the internal player management system and should be
    used carefully when modifying pet-related data. It does not directly affect the
    pet's actual behavior or appearance but rather updates the tracking mechanism
    for pet slot identifiers.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistencies in pet slot management,
    potentially causing issues with pet creation or deletion if not handled properly.
    Always ensure that the pet number is within valid ranges before setting it.
