    const
documentation:
  brief: Populates the data array with the object's initial values for client synchronization.
  description: The BuildValuesCreate method is responsible for initializing and populating
    a data array with the object's field values that are required for client-side
    object creation. This method is typically invoked when a Bag object needs to be
    sent to a player's client for display or interaction. It ensures all relevant
    fields such as item properties, container slots, and metadata are correctly set
    in the provided data buffer according to the specified flags and target context.
    The method operates on the internal state of the Bag object and prepares it for
    network transmission or client rendering.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array that will be filled with the object's
      initial field values. This buffer must be pre-allocated with sufficient space
      to hold all required fields.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags that determine which fields should be included in the
      data array and how they should be interpreted during client synchronization.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the target object's values,
      used for comparison or reference during field population. May be NULL if no
      target is specified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Object Creation
    code: 'Bag* bag = new Bag();

      int data[100];

      int flags = 0x01;

      const int* target = nullptr;

      bag->BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Target Context for Synchronization
    code: 'Bag* bag = new Bag();

      int data[100];

      int flags = 0x03;

      const int target[50] = {0};

      bag->BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore object update system and should only
    be called during object initialization or synchronization phases. The data buffer
    size must be sufficient to accommodate all fields defined by the flags parameter.
    It's typically used internally by the core update mechanisms.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the flags parameter can lead to incomplete or malformed
    object state being sent to clients, potentially causing display issues or client-side
    errors. Ensure that the target array is properly initialized if provided.
