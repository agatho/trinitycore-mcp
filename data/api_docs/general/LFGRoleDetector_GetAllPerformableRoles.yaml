  signature: uint8 LFGRoleDetector::GetAllPerformableRoles(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bitmask of all roles that a player is capable of performing
    in LFG.
  description: The GetAllPerformableRoles method returns a bitmask representing all
    the roles a given player can fulfill within the Looking for Group (LFG) system.
    This bitmask combines various role flags such as TANK, HEALER, and DAMAGE, indicating
    which classes or roles the player is eligible to take part in group content. The
    returned value is typically used by the LFG system to determine valid role assignments
    for a player when forming groups or matching with other players. This method does
    not consider current gear, level, or specialization limitations beyond what is
    defined in the player's role configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A uint8 bitmask where each bit represents a specific LFG role. Common
    bits include: 1 (TANK), 2 (HEALER), 4 (DAMAGE). The combination of these bits
    indicates all roles the player can perform.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nuint8 roles = lfgRoleDetector->GetAllPerformableRoles(player);\n\
      if (roles & LFG_ROLE_TANK)\n{\n    // Player can perform tank role\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's class, specialization, and other internal
    configurations to determine performable roles. It does not dynamically check current
    item levels or gear stats.
