documentation:
  brief: Processes a petition list request from a player and sends the current guild
    petitions to the client.
  description: The HandlePetitionShowList method is responsible for handling incoming
    petition list requests from players within the World of Warcraft client. When
    invoked, it retrieves the current set of available guild petitions and formats
    them into a packet that is sent back to the requesting player's client. This allows
    players to view existing guild petitions they can sign or interact with. The method
    typically operates in the context of the WorldSession class, which manages communication
    between a connected client and the server. It does not require any specific preconditions
    beyond an active session, but it may be subject to server-side filters or restrictions
    based on player permissions or petition status.

  - title: Basic Usage in Session Handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandlePetitionShowList(WorldPackets::Petition::PetitionShowList&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process petition list request\n    SendPetitionList();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the petition system in TrinityCore, which supports
    guild creation and management through player-signed petitions. It assumes that
    the session has been authenticated and that the player is eligible to view petitions.
    The actual petition data retrieval may involve database queries or cached data
    structures depending on server configuration.
