  signature: void BotScheduler::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Stops and cleans up all active bot scheduling operations
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing bot scheduling activities
    and performs necessary cleanup operations. It ensures that all scheduled bot tasks
    are properly canceled, resources are released, and the scheduler enters a clean
    shutdown state. This method is typically called during server shutdown or when
    disabling bot functionality to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper resource
    management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotScheduler* scheduler = BotScheduler::Instance();

      scheduler->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no bot operations are actively running
    to prevent race conditions. The shutdown process may take some time depending
    on the number of active bots and pending tasks.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while bots are actively processing may result in incomplete
    operations or resource leaks. Always ensure all bot activities are paused before
    invoking this method.
