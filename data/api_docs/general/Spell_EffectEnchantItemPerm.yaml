documentation:
  brief: Enchants an item with a permanent enchantment effect.
  description: This method applies a permanent enchantment to an item, typically used
    in spell effects that modify item properties. The enchantment is applied directly
    to the item's enchantment slots and persists through the item's lifetime. It is
    commonly used for items that require permanent upgrades or modifications such
    as weapons or armor with specific enchantments. This method does not require any
    parameters and operates on the current spell target.

  - title: Basic Enchantment Application
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, 12345);

      spell->EffectEnchantItemPerm();

      // This applies a permanent enchantment to the item'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include that this method typically operates on items
    in the player's inventory or equipment slots. It may require specific spell conditions
    or item requirements to be valid. Performance considerations are minimal as the
    method directly modifies item properties without complex calculations.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the spell target is an item, otherwise
    it will have no effect. The enchantment applied may not be compatible with all
    item types and could cause issues if used incorrectly.
