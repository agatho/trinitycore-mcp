  class: MarksmanshipHunterRefactored
  method: GetResourceCost
  signature: uint32 MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::GetResourceCost(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the resource cost of a specified spell for the Marksmanship
    Hunter class.
  description: The GetResourceCost method determines the amount of mana or other resources
    required to cast a specific spell within the Marksmanship Hunter specialization.
    This method is typically used during spell casting validation and resource management
    logic. It takes a spell identifier as input and returns the corresponding resource
    cost, which may vary based on factors such as spell level, hunter's gear, buffs,
    and talents. The method ensures that the hunter has sufficient resources before
    allowing spell casting to proceed.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to calculate the resource
      cost. This value corresponds to the Spell.dbc entry ID in the TrinityCore database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the resource cost required to cast
    the specified spell. A return value of 0 typically indicates that the spell does
    not consume any resources or that the spell ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 cost = hunter->GetResourceCost(75); // Calculate cost for Auto Shot\n\
      if (cost > 0 && hunter->GetPower(POWER_MANA) >= cost)\n{\n    // Proceed with\
      \ spell casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Validation
    code: "uint32 spellId = 14268; // Aimed Shot\nuint32 requiredCost = hunter->GetResourceCost(spellId);\n\
      if (requiredCost > 0 && hunter->GetPower(POWER_MANA) >= requiredCost)\n{\n \
      \   // Cast the spell\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, spellId, true);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle insufficient resources\n    hunter->SendSpellFailed(client,\
      \ spellId, SPELL_FAILED_NO_POWER);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Marksmanship Hunter's class-specific resource
    handling system. It may be overridden or extended by specialization-specific logic
    in derived classes. The returned value should be validated against the hunter's
    current power level before spell execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to a valid spell in the database,
    as invalid IDs may return unexpected values. This method does not perform actual
    resource deduction; it only calculates what the cost would be.
