  signature: std::string MovementArbiter::GetDiagnosticString() const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a diagnostic string containing movement arbiter state information
    for debugging purposes
  description: The GetDiagnosticString method constructs and returns a formatted string
    that contains detailed diagnostic information about the current state of the MovementArbiter
    instance. This includes various internal flags, movement-related statistics, and
    state indicators that are useful for debugging and monitoring movement behavior
    in TrinityCore. The returned string typically contains information such as active
    movement requests, pending actions, state machine status, and other relevant internal
    data that helps developers understand how the movement arbiter is processing entity
    movements. This method is primarily intended for use in development environments
    or diagnostic tools where detailed movement tracking is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted diagnostic information about the MovementArbiter's
    current state, including internal flags, movement statistics, and status indicators
    that aid in debugging movement-related issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Diagnostic Output
    code: "void DebugMovementArbiter(MovementArbiter* arbiter)\n{\n    if (arbiter)\n\
      \    {\n        std::string diagnostic = arbiter->GetDiagnosticString();\n \
      \       sLog->outString(\"Movement Arbiter Diagnostics:\\n%s\", diagnostic.c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Debug Logging
    code: "class MovementDebugHandler\n{\npublic:\n    static void LogArbiterState(MovementArbiter&\
      \ arbiter)\n    {\n        std::string diag = arbiter.GetDiagnosticString();\n\
      \        if (!diag.empty())\n        {\n            sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Movement Arbiter State:\\n%s\", diag.c_str());\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in debug builds or diagnostic contexts. The
    exact format and content of the returned string may vary based on internal implementation
    details and debugging flags. In production environments, this method might be
    optimized or disabled to avoid performance overhead.
  warnings: The diagnostic string may contain sensitive internal state information
    that should not be exposed in production environments without proper sanitization.
    Additionally, frequent calls to this method in high-frequency movement scenarios
    could introduce performance overhead.
