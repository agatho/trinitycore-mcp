  class: CriteriaHandler
  method: UpdateTimedCriteria
  signature: void CriteriaHandler::UpdateTimedCriteria(int timeDiff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates timed criteria progress for the player based on the elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateTimedCriteria method is responsible for advancing the progress
    of timed achievements or criteria that are tied to specific time-based events.
    This function is typically invoked by the game loop or event handlers to ensure
    that criteria which require a certain duration of time to complete are properly
    updated. It processes all active timed criteria associated with the player, checking
    whether the elapsed time since their activation meets or exceeds the required
    threshold for completion. The method does not directly trigger criterion completion
    but rather updates internal timers and progress states that may lead to criterion
    fulfillment in subsequent checks.
  parameters:
  - name: timeDiff
    description: The amount of time (in milliseconds) that has passed since the last
      update. This value is used to determine how much the timed criteria should advance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    int deltaTime = GetDeltaTime();\n    player->GetCriteriaHandler()->UpdateTimedCriteria(deltaTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating criteria with custom time delta
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    // Simulate a 5-second delay\
      \ before updating\n    int customTime = 5000;\n    player->GetCriteriaHandler()->UpdateTimedCriteria(customTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly, typically within the game's main
    update loop, to ensure timely progression of criteria. It is important that timeDiff
    accurately reflects real-world elapsed time for correct behavior. The implementation
    may involve internal tracking of multiple criteria timers and could potentially
    trigger criterion completion events if thresholds are met.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect or zero timeDiff values can cause unexpected
    behavior in timed criteria progress. Ensure that the time difference is always
    positive and represents actual elapsed gameplay time.
