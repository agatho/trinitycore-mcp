  method: RefreshDuration
  signature: void Aura::RefreshDuration(bool withMods)
documentation:
  brief: Refreshes the duration of an aura, resetting its timer and potentially applying
    modifiers.
  description: The RefreshDuration method resets the remaining duration of an aura
    to its base value. When called with 'withMods' set to true, it also reapplies
    any applicable modifiers or updates to the aura's duration based on current conditions
    such as caster buffs, target debuffs, or spell effects. This method is typically
    used when an aura needs to be prolonged or refreshed without losing its effects.
    It ensures that the aura remains active for the full duration and can be particularly
    important in scenarios involving stacking auras, periodic effects, or when maintaining
    specific buff/debuff states.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Refresh
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->RefreshDuration(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Refresh with Modifier Application
    code: "Aura* aura = unit->GetAura(67890);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->RefreshDuration(true);\n\
      \    // Duration is refreshed and any modifiers are reapplied\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not trigger aura application or removal events directly.
    It only resets the internal timer of the aura. If the aura has a periodic effect,
    it will continue to tick normally after refresh unless explicitly interrupted.
    The 'withMods' parameter determines whether modifier calculations should be reapplied
    during the refresh.
  warnings: Calling this method on an inactive or expired aura may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the aura is valid and active before calling RefreshDuration.
    Incorrect usage can lead to incorrect duration calculations or visual inconsistencies
    in the client.
