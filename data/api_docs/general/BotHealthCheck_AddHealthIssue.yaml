  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: AddHealthIssue
  signature: void BotHealthCheck::AddHealthIssue(HealthStatus status, const std::string
    & component, const std::string & message, uint32 currentTime)
documentation:
  brief: Records a health issue for a bot component with associated status and message.
  description: The AddHealthIssue method logs a specific health problem detected in
    a bot's component, including its status, descriptive message, and timestamp. This
    method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to track and manage
    the operational health of AI-controlled bots. It allows for detailed diagnostics
    and reporting of issues that may affect bot performance or functionality. The
    method does not return any value but stores the issue internally for later retrieval
    or processing by other system components.
  parameters:
  - name: status
    description: The current health status of the component, indicating severity (e.g.,
      OK, Warning, Critical).
  - name: component
    description: A string identifier for the specific bot component that is experiencing
      an issue (e.g., 'AI', 'Movement', 'Combat').
  - name: message
    description: A descriptive message explaining the nature of the health issue encountered.
  - name: currentTime
    description: The Unix timestamp indicating when the health issue was detected,
      used for logging and tracking purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: botHealthCheck.AddHealthIssue(HealthStatus::Critical, "AI", "Bot AI module
      failed to initialize", time(nullptr));
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Message
    code: 'std::string errorMsg = "Movement system timeout detected";

      botHealthCheck.AddHealthIssue(HealthStatus::Warning, "Movement", errorMsg, GetGameTime());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a health monitoring system for AI bots in TrinityCore.
    It assumes that the HealthStatus enum and related types are properly defined elsewhere
    in the codebase. The timestamp should ideally be in UTC to maintain consistency
    across different systems.
