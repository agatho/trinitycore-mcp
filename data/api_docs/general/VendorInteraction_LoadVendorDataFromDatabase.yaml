  method: LoadVendorDataFromDatabase
  signature: void VendorInteraction::LoadVendorDataFromDatabase()
documentation:
  brief: Loads vendor item data from the database into memory for use in NPC vendor
    interactions.
  description: The LoadVendorDataFromDatabase method retrieves all vendor item entries
    associated with the current vendor's entry ID from the game database. It populates
    internal data structures with item information such as item IDs, prices, quantities,
    and required reputation levels. This method is typically invoked during NPC initialization
    or when a vendor's inventory needs to be refreshed. The loaded data is used to
    determine what items a vendor can sell to players based on their faction, reputation,
    and other conditions. It ensures that the vendor's inventory reflects the latest
    database configuration without requiring manual updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Vendor Initialization
    code: "void NPCVendor::OnSpawn()\n{\n    // Load vendor data from database\n \
      \   VendorInteraction vendor;\n    vendor.LoadVendorDataFromDatabase();\n  \
      \  // Vendor is now ready to handle item sales\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query and should not be called frequently
    during runtime. It's typically invoked once per vendor instance during initialization.
    The method may block the calling thread while executing database operations, so
    it's recommended to call it asynchronously or during server startup.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same vendor instance without
    clearing previous data may result in duplicate entries. Ensure proper synchronization
    if called from multiple threads. This method does not validate item existence
    or pricing - it simply loads what exists in the database.
