  class: FrostDeathKnightRefactored
  method: GenerateRunicPower
  signature: void FrostDeathKnightRefactored::GenerateRunicPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates runic power for the frost death knight based on the specified amount.
  description: The GenerateRunicPower method is responsible for increasing the runic
    power of a frost death knight by a given amount. This method typically gets invoked
    when the player performs actions that grant runic power, such as attacking with
    runes or using certain abilities. It updates the internal runic power resource
    of the death knight, ensuring it stays within valid bounds. The method does not
    directly interact with the player's UI or visual effects but modifies the underlying
    resource system that powers various death knight abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of runic power to generate. Must be a non-negative integer
      value representing the quantity of runic power to add to the death knight's
      current resource pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FrostDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      dk->GenerateRunicPower(10); // Adds 10 runic power to the death knight'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Value
    code: 'FrostDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      uint32 powerGain = 5 + (rand() % 10); // Random power gain between 5 and 15

      dk->GenerateRunicPower(powerGain);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal runic power tracking variables and may
    trigger events or callbacks related to resource changes. It's important to ensure
    that the amount passed is valid and within expected ranges to avoid unexpected
    behavior in the death knight's ability usage.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter does not cause overflow of the runic
    power resource, especially when dealing with large values or repeated calls. The
    method assumes the death knight instance is properly initialized and valid before
    calling.
