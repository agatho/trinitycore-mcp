documentation:
  brief: Generates secondary resources for the system based on the specified amount.
  description: The GenerateSecondary method is responsible for creating or allocating
    secondary resource items within the IResourceSystem. This method typically handles
    the internal logic for producing additional resources that are not primary in
    nature, such as crafting materials, currency, or other game assets. It may be
    invoked during gameplay events like quest completion, loot drops, or resource
    gathering activities. The amount parameter determines how many secondary resources
    should be generated. This method does not return a value but modifies the internal
    state of the resource system.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'IResourceSystem* resourceSystem = GetResourceSystem();

      resourceSystem->GenerateSecondary(10); // Generates 10 secondary resources'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal resource pools and may trigger
    events or callbacks depending on the implementation. It should be called from
    a valid game context where resource management is active.
