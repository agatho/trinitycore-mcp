documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AccountScript instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The AccountScript destructor is automatically invoked when an AccountScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any resources allocated by the script, such as memory or event handlers.
    In the context of TrinityCore's scripting system, this destructor plays a crucial
    role in preventing memory leaks and maintaining stable server performance during
    script lifecycle management. The destructor does not accept any parameters and
    performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AccountScript instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    AccountScript* script = new AccountScript();\n\
      \    // ... perform operations with the script ...\n    delete script; // This\
      \ will invoke the destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The AccountScript destructor is part of TrinityCore's scripting framework
    and should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object lifetime.
    It is recommended to use smart pointers or proper RAII patterns to ensure automatic
    cleanup.
