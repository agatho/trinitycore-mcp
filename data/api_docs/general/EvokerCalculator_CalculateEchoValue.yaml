  class: EvokerCalculator
  method: CalculateEchoValue
  signature: int EvokerCalculator::CalculateEchoValue(int * caster, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the echo value based on caster and target parameters for evoker
    abilities.
  description: The CalculateEchoValue method computes a specific numerical value used
    in evoker class mechanics, likely related to spell effectiveness or resource calculation.
    This method takes two integer pointers representing the caster and target entities
    and returns an integer result that may influence evoker ability outcomes. The
    exact formula or logic is not specified in the source code but is integral to
    evoker gameplay mechanics. The method assumes valid pointer inputs and performs
    calculations based on internal evoker data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's data or identifier.
      Must point to a valid memory location containing relevant evoker state information.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's data or identifier.
      Must point to a valid memory location containing relevant target state information.
  returns: Returns an integer value that represents the calculated echo value for
    evoker abilities. The specific meaning of this value depends on the internal implementation
    and may affect spell damage, healing, or resource costs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int casterData = 100;

      int targetData = 50;

      int* casterPtr = &casterData;

      int* targetPtr = &targetData;

      int result = calculator.CalculateEchoValue(casterPtr, targetPtr);

      // Result would be calculated based on internal evoker logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal evoker class data structures and
    may depend on current spell state or player attributes. The pointers must be valid
    to avoid undefined behavior. Performance is expected to be minimal as this is
    a calculation-based method.
  warnings: Passing null or invalid pointers to this method will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that both caster and target parameters point to valid memory
    locations containing appropriate data before calling this function.
