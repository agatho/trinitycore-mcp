  class: BrewmasterShuffleTracker
  method: ExtendShuffle
  signature: void BrewmasterShuffleTracker::ExtendShuffle(uint32 durationMs)
documentation:
  brief: Extends the duration of an active Brewmaster shuffle effect by the specified
    milliseconds.
  description: The ExtendShuffle method is used to prolong the active duration of
    a Brewmaster's Shuffle ability. This method takes a duration in milliseconds and
    adds it to the currently active shuffle effect, effectively refreshing or extending
    its timer. The Brewmaster class in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation
    uses this functionality to manage the cooldown and active state of the Shuffle
    ability, which is a key component of the Brewmaster monk's damage mitigation and
    positioning strategy. This method typically gets invoked when certain conditions
    are met, such as applying a new buff or triggering a talent that extends the shuffle
    duration.
  parameters:
  - name: durationMs
    description: The number of milliseconds to extend the current shuffle effect duration
      by. Must be a positive integer value representing time in milliseconds.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Extending Shuffle Duration
    code: 'BrewmasterShuffleTracker* tracker = player->GetBrewmasterShuffleTracker();

      tracker->ExtendShuffle(5000); // Extends shuffle by 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Shuffle Extension
    code: "if (player->HasAura(SPELL_BREWMASTER_SHUFFLE)) {\n    BrewmasterShuffleTracker*\
      \ tracker = player->GetBrewmasterShuffleTracker();\n    tracker->ExtendShuffle(3000);\
      \ // Extend by 3 seconds if shuffle is active\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a shuffle effect is already active.
    The internal timer management of the shuffle effect must handle the addition of
    new time without resetting or breaking existing logic. It's important to ensure
    that the duration extension does not exceed any maximum limits imposed by the
    game mechanics or spell effects.
  warnings: Calling this method with a zero or negative value for durationMs may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect timer updates. Ensure that the shuffle effect
    is active before calling this method to avoid potential issues with state management.
