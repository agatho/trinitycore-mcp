  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: ValidatePositionalRequirements
  signature: bool RoleBasedCombatPositioning::ValidatePositionalRequirements(const
    int & pos, PositionalRequirement requirements, const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given positional requirement is met for a combat context.
  description: The ValidatePositionalRequirements method checks if a specified positional
    requirement, such as being in front, behind, or to the side of an opponent, is
    satisfied within the provided combat context. This method is used in role-based
    combat positioning logic to ensure that player actions or abilities are performed
    with correct spatial relationships relative to targets. It evaluates the current
    position of the unit against the required positional constraints and returns true
    if the requirement is met, false otherwise. The validation considers factors like
    angle, distance, and orientation in relation to the target.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer representing the positional identifier or index that defines
      which specific positional check is being performed.
  - name: requirements
    description: A PositionalRequirement enum or structure specifying the type of
      positional constraint to validate, such as FRONT, BACK, SIDE, etc.
  - name: context
    description: A CombatPositionContext object containing contextual information
      about the current combat scenario, including positions, orientations, and target
      details needed for validation.
  returns: Returns true if the positional requirement is satisfied within the given
    combat context; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Positional Validation
    code: "if (roleBasedCombatPositioning.ValidatePositionalRequirements(0, PositionalRequirement::FRONT,\
      \ combatContext)) {\n    // Player is correctly positioned in front of target\n\
      \    DoFrontalAttack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Conditional Positioning
    code: "bool isValid = roleBasedCombatPositioning.ValidatePositionalRequirements(\n\
      \    GetPositionalIndex(),\n    GetRequiredPositionalType(),\n    GetCombatContext()\n\
      );\nif (isValid) {\n    ApplyPositionalBuff();\n} else {\n    SendPositionalError();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger combat positioning system and relies on accurate
    position and orientation data from the CombatPositionContext. Ensure that all
    positional data in the context is up-to-date before calling this method to avoid
    incorrect validation results.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting or interpreting the 'pos' parameter may lead to unexpected
    behavior. Make sure that PositionalRequirement values are properly defined and
    consistent with the expected combat mechanics.
