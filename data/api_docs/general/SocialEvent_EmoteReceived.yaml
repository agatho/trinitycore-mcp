  class: SocialEvent
  method: EmoteReceived
  signature: SocialEvent SocialEvent::EmoteReceived(int player, int target, uint32
    emoteId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new SocialEvent instance when a player receives an
    emote from another player.
  description: The EmoteReceived method is used to generate a SocialEvent object that
    represents the action of one player receiving an emote from another player in
    the game. This method is typically invoked when a player performs an emote (such
    as waving, laughing, or greeting) and another player observes it. The returned
    SocialEvent can then be processed by the social system to update player interactions,
    reputation, or other social mechanics. The method requires valid player identifiers
    and a valid emote ID to create a meaningful event.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is receiving the emote.
      Must be a valid player GUID.
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is sending the emote.
      Must be a valid player GUID.
  - name: emoteId
    description: The ID of the emote being sent. Must correspond to a valid emote
      defined in the game's emote database.
  returns: Returns a new SocialEvent instance representing the emote received event.
    The returned object contains information about both players and the emote that
    was exchanged.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emote Received Event Creation
    code: SocialEvent event = SocialEvent::EmoteReceived(12345, 67890, 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Emote Received Event in Game Logic
    code: "SocialEvent event = SocialEvent::EmoteReceived(playerGuid, targetGuid,\
      \ emoteId);\n// Process the event to update social interactions\nif (event.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Apply social effects or notifications\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both player GUIDs are valid and that the emote ID
    exists in the game's emote database. The SocialEvent returned should be checked
    for validity before processing to avoid potential runtime errors.
  warnings: Ensure that player GUIDs are validated before calling this method, as
    invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Also, make sure that emoteId
    corresponds to an actual emote in the game's data files.
