  class: MaelstromResource
  method: SpendMaelstrom
  signature: bool MaelstromResource::SpendMaelstrom(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Spends a specified amount of Maelstrom resource from the player's current
    resource pool.
  description: The SpendMaelstrom method attempts to deduct a given amount of Maelstrom
    resource from the player's current resource pool. This method is typically used
    in World of Warcraft TrinityCore implementations for abilities or spells that
    consume Maelstrom, such as those available to Enhancement Shaman class players.
    The method returns true if the specified amount could be successfully deducted
    from the resource pool, and false if there are insufficient resources. It is important
    to note that this method does not directly modify the player's resource display;
    it only performs the internal deduction operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified amount of Maelstrom was successfully spent,
    or false if there were insufficient resources to complete the transaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetMaelstromResource()->SpendMaelstrom(50)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ spent 50 Maelstrom\n    // Proceed with ability execution\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Not enough Maelstrom available\n    // Handle insufficient resource case\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spell Logic
    code: "class MaelstromSpellHandler {\npublic:\n    bool CastMaelstromAbility(Player*\
      \ player, uint32 requiredMaelstrom) {\n        if (player->GetMaelstromResource()->SpendMaelstrom(requiredMaelstrom))\
      \ {\n            // Execute spell effect\n            return true;\n       \
      \ }\n        return false; // Insufficient Maelstrom\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player has a valid MaelstromResource object. The
    actual resource consumption should be checked against the player's current resource
    pool before calling this method to avoid unnecessary operations.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if sufficient resources are available
    may result in invalid state or unexpected behavior. Always validate resource availability
    before spending.
