  class: AdaptiveThrottler
  method: ShouldThrottle
  signature: bool AdaptiveThrottler::ShouldThrottle(uint32 botPriority)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot should be throttled based on its priority level.
  description: The ShouldThrottle method evaluates whether a bot with the specified
    priority should be throttled to prevent system overload or maintain performance
    balance. This adaptive throttling mechanism dynamically adjusts based on current
    system load and bot priority levels. The method typically checks against internal
    thresholds or counters to decide if processing of the bot's requests should be
    delayed or limited. It is commonly used in AI-driven bot systems to ensure optimal
    resource utilization without overwhelming the server.
  parameters:
  - name: botPriority
    description: The priority level of the bot, typically ranging from 0 (lowest)
      to 100 (highest). Higher values indicate more critical or resource-intensive
      bots that may be subject to different throttling rules.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should be throttled based on its priority and system
    conditions; otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates that processing
    of this bot's requests should be delayed or limited to maintain system stability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot processing loop
    code: "AdaptiveThrottler throttler;\nuint32 priority = 75;\nif (throttler.ShouldThrottle(priority))\
      \ {\n    // Delay bot processing\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n\
      } else {\n    // Process bot normally\n    ProcessBot(priority);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision making
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    bool Update() {\n        if (throttler_.ShouldThrottle(priority_))\
      \ {\n            // Reduce bot activity or defer actions\n            return\
      \ false;\n        }\n        // Continue normal AI behavior\n        PerformAction();\n\
      \        return true;\n    }\nprivate:\n    AdaptiveThrottler throttler_;\n\
      \    uint32 priority_ = 50;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely maintains internal state about system load and bot activity
    to make intelligent throttling decisions. The exact algorithm for determining
    when to throttle is implementation-specific but typically involves comparing the
    bot's priority against dynamic thresholds that adjust based on current server
    conditions.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to bots being unnecessarily throttled,
    causing degraded performance or missed opportunities for bot interaction. Developers
    should ensure proper integration with system monitoring and load balancing mechanisms.
