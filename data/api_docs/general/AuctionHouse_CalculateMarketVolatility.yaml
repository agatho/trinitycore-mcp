  signature: float AuctionHouse::CalculateMarketVolatility(const int & priceHistory)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the market volatility factor for auction house item pricing based
    on historical price data.
  description: The CalculateMarketVolatility method computes a floating-point value
    that represents how volatile the market is for a given item's auction prices.
    This value is typically used to adjust auction house pricing strategies, determine
    bid increments, or influence item listing behavior within the auction house system.
    The calculation takes into account historical price movements and can be used
    to simulate realistic market dynamics in the game environment. The method relies
    on internal data structures that track price history for items within the auction
    house.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated market volatility factor.
    A higher value indicates more volatile market conditions, while a lower value
    suggests stable pricing behavior. Values typically range from 0.0 (stable) to
    2.0+ (highly volatile).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float volatility = auctionHouse->CalculateMarketVolatility();\nif (volatility\
      \ > 1.5f)\n{\n    // Apply premium pricing for highly volatile items\n    item->SetAuctionPrice(item->GetAuctionPrice()\
      \ * 1.2f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal price history tracking mechanisms and may
    be called periodically to update market conditions. The implementation details
    are not visible, but it's expected to utilize statistical methods such as standard
    deviation or variance calculations on historical price data.
  warnings: The volatility calculation may be affected by insufficient historical
    data points, potentially leading to inaccurate results for newly listed items.
    Ensure proper initialization of price history tracking before calling this method.
