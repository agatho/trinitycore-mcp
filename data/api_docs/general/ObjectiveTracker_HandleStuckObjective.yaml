  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::HandleStuckObjective(Player * bot, ObjectiveState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the stuck objective state for a bot player during quest tracking.
  description: The HandleStuckObjective method is responsible for managing and resolving
    situations where a bot player's quest objective becomes stuck or unresponsive.
    This typically occurs when the bot fails to progress through a quest objective
    due to environmental issues, pathfinding problems, or other game state inconsistencies.
    The method evaluates the current state of the objective and attempts to reset
    or reinitialize it to allow the bot to continue quest progression. It is part
    of the ObjectiveTracker system that monitors and manages all active quest objectives
    for player characters in the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character whose
      objective state needs to be handled. This parameter must not be null and should
      represent a valid bot instance.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to the ObjectiveState object that contains the current
      state information of the stuck objective. This parameter is modified in-place
      to reflect any changes made during the handling process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleStuckObjective
    code: "void ExampleFunction(Player* bot, ObjectiveState& state) {\n    ObjectiveTracker\
      \ tracker;\n    tracker.HandleStuckObjective(bot, state);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with quest progression system
    code: "void QuestProgressHandler(Player* bot, uint32 questId) {\n    ObjectiveTracker*\
      \ tracker = bot->GetObjectiveTracker();\n    if (tracker) {\n        ObjectiveState*\
      \ state = tracker->GetObjectiveState(questId);\n        if (state && state->IsStuck())\
      \ {\n            tracker->HandleStuckObjective(bot, *state);\n        }\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the ObjectiveTracker system
    when it detects that an objective has become unresponsive. The implementation
    may involve resetting objective progress, reinitializing quest states, or triggering
    alternative quest completion paths. Developers should be aware that this method
    modifies the provided state object directly and may trigger additional quest events
    or notifications.
  warnings: The HandleStuckObjective method assumes valid input parameters and will
    likely crash if passed null pointers. It's important to verify that both the bot
    player and objective state are properly initialized before calling this method.
    Additionally, excessive calls to this method without proper state checking may
    lead to unexpected quest behavior or infinite loops in quest progression.
