  class: QuestRequirementAnalyzer
  method: AnalyzeItemRequirements
  signature: void QuestRequirementAnalyzer::AnalyzeItemRequirements(const Quest *
    quest, Player * bot, int & issues)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes item requirements for a given quest and player, updating the issues
    counter with any validation errors.
  description: The AnalyzeItemRequirements method evaluates whether a player has the
    necessary items to complete a specified quest. It checks against the quest's item
    requirements, including required items, item counts, and item flags. The method
    updates the provided issues parameter with the number of validation failures encountered
    during the analysis. This function is typically used by quest requirement analyzers
    or bots to determine if a player can proceed with a quest. The method does not
    modify the player's inventory or quest state directly; it only performs validation
    checks.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that contains the item requirements to
      be validated. Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose inventory
      is being checked against quest requirements. Must not be null.
  - name: issues
    description: Reference to an integer that will be incremented by the number of
      validation failures found during item requirement analysis.
  returns: None. This method has a void return type and modifies the issues parameter
    directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest validation
    code: "QuestRequirementAnalyzer analyzer;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Get player\
      \ reference\nQuest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345); // Get quest\
      \ by ID\nint issueCount = 0;\nanalyzer.AnalyzeItemRequirements(quest, player,\
      \ issueCount);\nif (issueCount > 0) {\n    // Handle validation issues\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Quest has %d item requirement issues.\", issueCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with bot quest handling
    code: "void Bot::CheckQuestRequirements(Quest* quest) {\n    int issues = 0;\n\
      \    QuestRequirementAnalyzer analyzer;\n    analyzer.AnalyzeItemRequirements(quest,\
      \ GetPlayer(), issues);\n    if (issues == 0) {\n        // All requirements\
      \ met\n        SendQuestComplete(quest);\n    } else {\n        // Notify player\
      \ about missing items\n        SendNotification(\"Missing %d item requirements\
      \ for quest.\", issues);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs checks against the player's inventory and may access
    database values for quest item requirements. It does not perform any modifications
    to the player's state or quest progress. The issues counter is incremented for
    each failed requirement check, which can include missing items, insufficient quantities,
    or incorrect item flags.
  warnings: Ensure that both the quest and bot parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as null pointer dereferences will occur. The method assumes
    that the player's inventory has already been properly loaded and is up-to-date
    with current item counts.
