documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior against a specified target in the ScheduledChangeAI
    system
  description: The AttackStart method is responsible for triggering the AI's attack
    sequence when a target has been identified. This method typically handles the
    transition from idle or patrol states to active combat mode, setting up the necessary
    flags and behaviors required for the creature to begin attacking the specified
    target. It may also handle initial threat generation and positioning adjustments.
    The method is part of the ScheduledChangeAI framework which manages AI behavior
    changes over time based on various conditions and events.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or index
      within the AI's target list. This parameter likely specifies which entity the
      AI should begin attacking, potentially referencing a unit GUID or internal target
      index.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Start Usage
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    int targetId = 12345;\n    scheduledAI->AttackStart(&targetId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Attack Start with Dynamic Target Selection
    code: "void selectAndAttackTarget(Unit* target) {\n    if (target && target->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n        int targetGuid = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        scheduledAI->AttackStart(&targetGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a valid
    combat target is detected. The parameter should point to a valid target identifier
    that exists within the current AI context. Implementation may involve threat calculation,
    target locking, and state transitions.
  warnings: Ensure that param0 points to a valid target before calling this method,
    otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method assumes the target is already
    in combat range or will be brought into range through normal AI movement logic.
