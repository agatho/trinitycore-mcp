  method: ModSrc
  signature: void SpellCastTargets::ModSrc(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the source position of a spell cast target by the specified offset.
  description: The ModSrc method adjusts the source location of a spell cast target
    by applying a given positional offset. This is typically used in spell casting
    mechanics to modify where a spell originates from, such as when a caster's position
    shifts during channeling or when spells are cast from a different location than
    the original caster. The method operates on the internal source coordinates of
    the SpellCastTargets object and modifies them in-place. It is commonly invoked
    during spell processing to ensure accurate targeting behavior based on dynamic
    game state changes.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the positional offset
      to be applied to the source coordinates. This value typically corresponds to
      a delta in coordinate space, allowing for precise adjustments to the spell's
      starting point.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adjusting Spell Source Position
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      int offset = 5;

      targets.ModSrc(offset);

      // Modifies the source position by adding 5 units to the current coordinates'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Source Adjustment During Spell Casting
    code: "void HandleSpellCast(Spell* spell) {\n    SpellCastTargets targets = spell->GetSpellCastTargets();\n\
      \    int dynamicOffset = GetCaster()->GetSpeed() * 2;\n    targets.ModSrc(dynamicOffset);\n\
      \    // Adjusts spell source based on caster's movement speed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the SpellCastTargets object directly.
    It should be used carefully during spell processing to avoid unintended side effects.
    The positional offset is applied in a coordinate system specific to the game world,
    and its interpretation depends on the context in which it's called.
  warnings: Modifying source positions can affect spell targeting accuracy and may
    cause spells to miss their intended targets if not handled properly. Ensure that
    offsets are within reasonable bounds for the game's coordinate system to prevent
    invalid positioning.
