  class: TargetSelector
  method: EstimateTimeToKill
  signature: float TargetSelector::EstimateTimeToKill(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the estimated time required to kill a target unit based on current
    combat statistics and damage output.
  description: The EstimateTimeToKill method computes how long it would take for the
    AI-controlled unit to reduce the target's health to zero, using the current attack
    power, spell damage, and target's health pool. This estimation considers the unit's
    current weapon speed, critical hit chance, and any applicable damage modifiers.
    The result is returned as a floating-point value representing seconds. This method
    is typically used by AI decision-making systems to prioritize targets or determine
    optimal action timing during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the estimated time in seconds required to kill
    the target unit. Returns 0.0f if the target is already dead or if no valid estimation
    can be made due to missing data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI logic
    code: "float timeToKill = selector->EstimateTimeToKill(targetUnit);\nif (timeToKill\
      \ < 2.0f) {\n    // Prioritize this target for immediate attack\n    selector->SetCurrentTarget(targetUnit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing multiple targets for optimal selection
    code: "Unit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nfloat shortestTime = FLT_MAX;\nfor (auto&\
      \ target : possibleTargets) {\n    float estimatedTime = selector->EstimateTimeToKill(target);\n\
      \    if (estimatedTime < shortestTime && estimatedTime > 0.0f) {\n        shortestTime\
      \ = estimatedTime;\n        bestTarget = target;\n    }\n}\nif (bestTarget)\
      \ {\n    selector->SetCurrentTarget(bestTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate unit stats and may not account for external
    factors such as temporary buffs, debuffs, or environmental effects. It assumes
    that the attacker will maintain consistent damage output without interruption.
    The estimation is based on average damage calculations and does not factor in
    random variations like critical strikes unless those are already included in the
    unit's stat calculations.
  warnings: The method returns 0.0f for invalid targets or when no valid time estimation
    can be performed, which might lead to incorrect AI behavior if not properly handled.
    Ensure that target units are valid and alive before calling this method to avoid
    unexpected results.
