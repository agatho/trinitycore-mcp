documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of successful attempts for the action
  description: The GetSuccessCount method retrieves the count of successful executions
    or completions for a given action within the AI system. This value is typically
    used to track performance, measure success rates, or determine action effectiveness
    in various game scenarios such as spell casting, ability usage, or AI decision-making
    processes. The method provides a read-only view of the internal success counter
    and does not modify any state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of successful attempts for
    this action. Returns zero if no successes have been recorded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Success Count
    code: "uint32 successCount = action->GetSuccessCount();\nif (successCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Perform some logic based on successful actions\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Action has %u successful executions.\", successCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Success Count for AI Decision Making
    code: "if (action->GetSuccessCount() < 5)\n{\n    // Consider re-evaluating or\
      \ switching to a different action\n    ai->SetNextAction(\"alternative_action\"\
      );\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Continue with current action as it's proving effective\n\
      \    ai->SetNextAction(\"continue_current_action\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with action execution tracking
    and should be called after actions have been processed. The success count may
    be reset or updated during AI cycle processing depending on implementation details.
