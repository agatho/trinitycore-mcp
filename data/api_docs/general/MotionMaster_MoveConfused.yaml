  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveConfused
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveConfused()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a confused movement behavior for the unit, causing it to move erratically.
  description: The MoveConfused method sets the unit's movement state to confused,
    which causes the unit to move in random directions and speeds. This behavior is
    typically used when a unit is affected by a confusion spell or effect. The motion
    master will manage the confused state until it is explicitly cleared or the unit's
    state changes. During this time, the unit will not follow normal pathfinding or
    movement patterns.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Unit* target = ...;

      MotionMaster* motion = target->GetMotionMaster();

      motion->MoveConfused();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately start movement; it sets up the motion state.
    The actual movement will begin when the next update cycle occurs. Confused movement
    is typically temporary and should be cleared using MoveIdle() or similar methods
    once the confusion effect ends.
