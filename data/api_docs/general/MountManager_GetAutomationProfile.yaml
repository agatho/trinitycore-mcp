documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the mount automation profile associated with a specified player
    GUID
  description: The GetAutomationProfile method fetches the mount automation configuration
    for a given player identified by their unique identifier (GUID). This profile
    contains settings and rules that govern how the player's mounts are automatically
    managed during gameplay, such as which mounts should be used in specific zones
    or under certain conditions. The method is typically used by the mount management
    system to apply player-specific automation behaviors. It requires a valid player
    GUID to retrieve the corresponding profile, and will return an empty or default
    profile if no automation settings exist for that player.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose mount automation
      profile is being retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: A MountAutomationProfile object containing the automation settings for
    the specified player. If no profile exists for the player, an empty or default
    profile is returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve automation profile for a player
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nMountAutomationProfile profile = mountManager->GetAutomationProfile(playerId);\n\
      // Use the profile to determine mount automation behavior\nif (profile.IsEnabled())\
      \ {\n    // Apply automation rules\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MountManager class and assumes that the player
    GUID corresponds to an active character in the game world. The returned MountAutomationProfile
    may contain default values if no custom settings have been configured for the
    player.
