  class: ScopedPatternRecording
  method: RecordAction
  signature: void ScopedPatternRecording::RecordAction(uint32_t actionId)
documentation:
  brief: Records an action ID within the scoped pattern recording context.
  description: The RecordAction method logs a specific action identifier into the
    current scoped pattern recording session. This functionality is typically used
    in game AI or behavior scripting to track and log player actions or NPC behaviors
    for later analysis, debugging, or pattern recognition. The method does not return
    any value and operates directly on the internal state of the ScopedPatternRecording
    instance. It assumes that the recording session has been properly initialized
    and is active.
  parameters:
  - name: actionId
    description: A unique identifier representing a specific action within the game
      system. This value should be a valid uint32_t that corresponds to an action
      defined in the game's action mapping or behavior tree.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ScopedPatternRecording recorder;

      recorder.RecordAction(1001); // Records the action with ID 1001'
    language: cpp
  - title: In AI Context
    code: "void PlayerAI::OnPlayerAction(uint32_t actionId)\n{\n    if (m_patternRecorder)\n\
      \        m_patternRecorder->RecordAction(actionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the ScopedPatternRecording instance
    is in an active recording state. If invoked outside of such a context, it may
    silently fail or produce undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that actionId values are within expected ranges and do not exceed
    system limits. Repeatedly calling this method with large volumes of data may impact
    performance if not managed properly.
