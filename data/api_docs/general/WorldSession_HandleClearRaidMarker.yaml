  brief: Clears all raid markers for the player's current raid group
  description: This method handles the client request to clear all raid markers that
    have been placed by the player within their current raid instance. It processes
    the ClearRaidMarker packet sent from the client and removes all visible raid markers
    from the world map for that specific player's group. The functionality is part
    of the World of Warcraft raid management system, allowing players to reset their
    raid marker placements during encounters. This method typically executes when
    a player uses the 'Clear Raid Markers' option in the raid interface or when certain
    raid mechanics require marker reset.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleClearRaidMarker(WorldPackets::Party::ClearRaidMarker&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n        if (Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup())\n        {\n            // Clear all raid markers\
      \ for this player's group\n            group->ClearRaidMarkers(player->GetGUID());\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects the current player's raid markers and does not impact
    other players' marker placements. The actual clearing of markers is handled through
    the Group class which manages raid marker state across all group members.
