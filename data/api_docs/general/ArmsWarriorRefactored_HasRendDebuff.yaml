  method: HasRendDebuff
  signature: bool ArmsWarriorRefactored::HasRendDebuff(::Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the target unit has the Rend debuff applied.
  description: This method determines whether a specified target unit currently has
    the Rend debuff active. The Rend debuff is a warrior ability that applies periodic
    damage over time and increases the effectiveness of certain melee attacks. This
    check is commonly used in combat logic to determine if a warrior's attack will
    benefit from increased damage or other Rend-specific mechanics. The method performs
    a lookup on the target unit's aura application state to verify the presence of
    this specific debuff.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit has the Rend debuff applied, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat logic
    code: "if (warrior->HasRendDebuff(target)) {\n    // Apply increased damage or\
      \ special effects\n    damage *= 1.3f; // 30% damage increase\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a warrior's attack sequence
    code: "void ArmsWarriorRefactored::ExecuteAttack(Unit* target) {\n    uint32 damage\
      \ = CalculateBaseDamage(target);\n    \n    if (HasRendDebuff(target)) {\n \
      \       damage += target->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_DAMAGE, 0)->GetAmount();\n\
      \    }\n    \n    target->DealDamage(this, damage, nullptr, DIRECT_DAMAGE, SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_NORMAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying aura system to determine debuff status.
    It may not account for custom or modified debuff tracking systems. The implementation
    assumes that Rend is tracked as a single aura effect with specific spell ID and
    effect type.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as accessing invalid units can cause crashes. This method should
    only be called during active combat situations where the target's debuff state
    is relevant.
