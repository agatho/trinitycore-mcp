  class: Battleground
  method: operator=
  signature: Battleground & Battleground::operator=(const Battleground & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the state and properties of one battleground object to another.
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy of all relevant data members
    from the source Battleground object to the target Battleground object. This assignment
    operator ensures that all battleground-specific attributes, including player counts,
    team scores, game state flags, and internal data structures are properly transferred.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method is crucial
    for managing battleground instances during creation, duplication, or state transitions.
    The operation maintains consistency across battleground objects and prevents data
    corruption when one battleground instance is replaced by another.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source Battleground object whose state and properties will be
      copied to this object. This parameter must be a valid, initialized Battleground
      instance.
  returns: A reference to the current Battleground object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed. This allows for chaining of assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'Battleground bg1;

      Battleground bg2;

      // ... initialize bg1 with data ...

      bg2 = bg1; // Assigns all properties from bg1 to bg2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'Battleground bg1, bg2, bg3;

      // ... initialize bg1 with data ...

      bg3 = bg2 = bg1; // Chained assignment operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely performs deep copying of all member variables including
    pointers to player lists, score tracking, and battleground-specific state information.
    The implementation should handle potential memory management issues when copying
    complex data structures. This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore
    framework during battleground lifecycle management.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this operator with battlegrounds that are
    actively in use or have players participating, as assignment may invalidate references
    or cause synchronization issues. The method should not be called on battlegrounds
    that are currently running or being processed by the game loop.
