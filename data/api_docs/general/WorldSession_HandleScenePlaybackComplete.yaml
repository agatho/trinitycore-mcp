documentation:
  brief: Handles the completion of a scene playback event from the client
  description: This method processes the ScenePlaybackComplete packet sent by the
    client when a scene animation or cinematic sequence has finished playing. It is
    typically invoked as part of the WorldSession's packet handling system to manage
    the end state of scene sequences, which may involve cleaning up resources, triggering
    follow-up events, or updating player state. The method does not return any value
    and operates directly on the session context.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleScenePlaybackComplete(WorldPackets::Scenes::ScenePlaybackComplete&\
      \ scenePlaybackComplete)\n{\n    // Process completion of scene playback\n \
      \   sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_NETWORKIO, \"Scene playback completed for player\
      \ %s\", GetPlayer()->GetName().c_str());\n    // Additional logic to handle\
      \ scene end state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the scene system in TrinityCore and is expected to
    be called only when a client has finished playing a scene. It should not be invoked
    manually unless handling custom scene events.
