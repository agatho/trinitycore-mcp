  method: HasConverged
  signature: bool BehaviorCluster::HasConverged() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the behavior cluster has reached a stable convergence
    state.
  description: The HasConverged method checks if the behavior cluster has achieved
    a stable state where further iterations will not significantly alter the cluster's
    behavior. This is typically used in AI decision-making systems to determine when
    to stop refining or updating behavioral patterns. The method evaluates internal
    convergence criteria such as changes in cluster centroids, stability of assigned
    behaviors, or minimal variation in key metrics over successive iterations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the behavior cluster has converged to a stable state, indicating
    that further processing is unnecessary or redundant. Returns false if the cluster
    is still evolving or has not yet reached convergence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Loop
    code: "if (cluster->HasConverged())\n{\n    // Stop refining behavior patterns\n\
      \    break;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Continue updating cluster\n    cluster->Update();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Behavior Tree Execution
    code: "class BehaviorNode\n{\npublic:\n    bool Execute()\n    {\n        if (m_cluster->HasConverged())\n\
      \        {\n            // Use final behavior pattern\n            return m_cluster->GetFinalBehavior();\n\
      \        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Update and retry\n     \
      \       m_cluster->Update();\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during iterative AI processing loops. The
    convergence criteria may vary based on implementation details, but generally involves
    checking for minimal change in cluster properties over multiple iterations. Performance-wise,
    this check should be lightweight as it's often called frequently in decision-making
    contexts.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-converged state means the behavior is invalid
    or unstable - it simply indicates that refinement is still needed. Always ensure
    proper initialization of the behavior cluster before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior.
