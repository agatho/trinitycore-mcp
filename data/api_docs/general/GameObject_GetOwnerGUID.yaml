  method: GetOwnerGUID
  signature: int GameObject::GetOwnerGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the GameObject's owner.
  description: The GetOwnerGUID method retrieves the GUID of the object that owns
    the current GameObject. This is typically used in scenarios where a GameObject
    is associated with a player or creature, such as when a GameObject is created
    by a player or spawned by a creature. The method returns an integer representing
    the GUID of the owner, which can be used for identification purposes within the
    game mechanics. It is important to note that this method may return 0 if no owner
    exists, indicating that the GameObject is not associated with any specific entity.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents an integer GUID of the owner of the GameObject.
    If no owner exists, it returns 0, indicating that the GameObject is not associated
    with any player or creature.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int ownerGUID = gameobject->GetOwnerGUID();\nif (ownerGUID != 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Do something with the GUID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No owner exists\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in game mechanics where GameObjects are associated
    with players or creatures. It may be used in conjunction with other methods like
    GetOwner to determine the entity that created or controls the GameObject.
  warnings: The method returns 0 if no owner exists, which can lead to confusion if
    not handled properly. Care should be taken when using this method in conditional
    statements to avoid incorrect assumptions about ownership.
