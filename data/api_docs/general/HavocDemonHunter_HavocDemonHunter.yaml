  brief: Initializes a Havoc Demon Hunter AI bot with the specified player.
  description: The HavocDemonHunter constructor initializes a Demon Hunter AI bot
    specifically configured for havoc specialization. This method sets up the bot's
    behavior, abilities, and combat logic tailored for havoc demon hunter gameplay.
    It configures the bot's target selection, spell usage, and tactical decisions
    based on the havoc specialization mechanics. The initialization process includes
    setting up the bot's class-specific abilities, cooldown management, and resource
    tracking systems. This constructor is typically called when creating or spawning
    a new havoc demon hunter AI character within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Creating a Havoc Demon Hunter Bot
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      HavocDemonHunter havocBot(bot);

      // The bot is now initialized with havoc demon hunter AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes that the provided Player object has already been
    properly initialized and configured. The bot's AI behavior will be fully functional
    after this constructor call, but additional configuration may be needed for specific
    gameplay scenarios or custom behaviors.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player parameter is a valid, properly initialized object
    before calling this constructor. Calling this constructor with a null or improperly
    initialized player may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
