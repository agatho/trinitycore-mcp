  class: Map
  method: GridMarkNoUnload
  signature: void Map::GridMarkNoUnload(uint32 x, uint32 y)
documentation:
  brief: Marks a grid cell on the map to prevent unloading of its associated data.
  description: The GridMarkNoUnload method is used to mark a specific grid cell (defined
    by x and y coordinates) within a Map instance to prevent it from being unloaded.
    This is typically used during critical game events or when objects are actively
    interacting with a grid, ensuring that the grid's data remains in memory. The
    method does not return any value and operates directly on the map's internal grid
    management system. It is commonly invoked when players or NPCs are present in
    a grid area to maintain performance and prevent unexpected loading/unloading behavior
    during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the grid cell to mark. This represents the horizontal
      position within the map's grid system.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid cell to mark. This represents the vertical
      position within the map's grid system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking a Grid Cell to Prevent Unloading
    code: 'Map* map = player->GetMap();

      map->GridMarkNoUnload(10, 15); // Mark grid cell at (10, 15) to prevent unloading'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal map management system and should be used
    carefully. It affects memory usage and performance by preventing grid unloading,
    which can be important for maintaining stable gameplay during active events or
    when objects are present in a specific area.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to increased memory consumption and
    potential performance degradation. Ensure that grids are properly marked and unmarked
    as needed to avoid unnecessary resource retention.
