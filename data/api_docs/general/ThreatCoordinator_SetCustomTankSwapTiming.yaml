  method: SetCustomTankSwapTiming
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetCustomTankSwapTiming(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the custom interval for tank swap timing in threat coordination.
  description: Configures the time interval, in milliseconds, at which tank swaps
    are evaluated or executed within the threat coordination system. This method allows
    developers to customize when and how often the system checks for potential tank
    swaps based on threat levels and other combat conditions. The value specified
    determines the frequency of threat recalculations and tank swap decisions during
    encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The time interval in milliseconds between tank swap evaluations.
      Valid values are positive integers representing time durations. Lower values
      result in more frequent checks but may impact performance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank Swap Timing Configuration
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetCustomTankSwapTiming(2000); // Set tank swap checks every 2
      seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: High-Frequency Tank Swap Checks
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      coordinator->SetCustomTankSwapTiming(500); // Check every 500ms for rapid response'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the overall responsiveness of threat-based tank swapping
    behavior. Setting very low intervals may increase CPU usage during combat encounters.
    The default interval is typically determined by the encounter design and should
    be adjusted carefully to maintain game balance.
  warnings: Modifying this value can significantly affect gameplay balance and performance.
    Extreme values (too low or too high) may cause unexpected behavior in tank swap
    decisions or introduce performance bottlenecks. Ensure thorough testing after
    changes.
