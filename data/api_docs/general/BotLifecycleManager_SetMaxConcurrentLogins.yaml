  method: SetMaxConcurrentLogins
  signature: void BotLifecycleManager::SetMaxConcurrentLogins(uint32 max)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of concurrent bot logins allowed by the system.
  description: The SetMaxConcurrentLogins method configures the upper limit on how
    many bot characters can be simultaneously logged into the game world. This setting
    is crucial for managing server resources and preventing excessive load caused
    by too many bots logging in at once. The value is typically set during initialization
    or configuration of the bot system, and affects all subsequent bot login attempts
    until changed again. This method does not validate the input parameter; it directly
    assigns the provided value to an internal maximum concurrent logins variable.
  parameters:
  - name: max
    description: The maximum number of concurrent bot logins allowed. Must be a positive
      integer representing the desired limit. Values of zero or very large numbers
      may cause unexpected behavior or resource exhaustion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Concurrent Bot Logins
    code: BotLifecycleManager::instance()->SetMaxConcurrentLogins(100);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Bot Login Limits Based on Server Capacity
    code: 'uint32 maxBots = sWorld->getIntConfig(CONFIG_MAX_BOT_ACCOUNTS);

      BotLifecycleManager::instance()->SetMaxConcurrentLogins(maxBots);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global setting that affects all bot login operations.
    It should be called before any bots attempt to log in, as changing this value
    during active bot sessions may not immediately affect already logged-in bots.
    The implementation likely stores the value in a private member variable and uses
    it to enforce limits during login validation.
  warnings: Setting this value too high can lead to server performance degradation
    or resource exhaustion. Setting it to zero effectively disables bot logins. This
    method does not perform bounds checking on the input parameter, so invalid values
    may cause undefined behavior.
