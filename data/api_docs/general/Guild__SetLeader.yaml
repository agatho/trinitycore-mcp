  class: Guild
  method: _SetLeader
  signature: void Guild::_SetLeader(int trans, Member & leader)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the leader of the guild to the specified member.
  description: The _SetLeader method is an internal function used by the Guild class
    to assign a new leader to the guild. This method updates the guild's leadership
    structure and performs necessary operations such as updating permissions, notifying
    members, and potentially modifying the guild's database entry. The 'trans' parameter
    likely represents a transaction identifier for database operations, while 'leader'
    is a reference to the member who will become the new guild master. This method
    is typically called internally by the game system when a guild leader is changed
    through in-game commands or administrative actions.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier for database operations. Used to ensure data
      consistency during the leadership change process.
  - name: leader
    description: Reference to the Member object that will become the new guild leader.
      Must be a valid member of the guild.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a new guild leader
    code: "Guild* guild = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (guild)\n{\n\
      \    Member newLeader = guild->GetMember(playerGuid);\n    if (newLeader.IsInGuild())\n\
      \    {\n        guild->_SetLeader(0, newLeader);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly from external
    code. The method likely handles database transactions and member permission updates
    automatically. It assumes the provided member is already validated as a guild
    member.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper validation may result in inconsistent
    guild state or database corruption. Always ensure the target member is valid and
    part of the guild before calling this function.
