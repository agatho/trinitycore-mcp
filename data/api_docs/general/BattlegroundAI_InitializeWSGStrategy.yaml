documentation:
  brief: Initializes the Wintergrasp strategy for the battleground AI.
  description: The InitializeWSGStrategy method sets up the strategic behavior and
    decision-making logic specific to the Wintergrasp battleground. This method configures
    the AI's approach to objectives, resource management, and tactical responses during
    Wintergrasp operations. It typically initializes internal state variables, sets
    up strategy priorities, and prepares the AI for engagement with Wintergrasp-specific
    mechanics such as siege vehicle usage, objectives capture, and faction-based strategies.
    The method is usually called during battleground initialization or when the AI
    needs to reset its strategic approach.

  notes: This method is typically invoked during battleground setup and should not
    be called repeatedly during active gameplay. The strategy configuration may depend
    on the current battleground state or faction alignment.
