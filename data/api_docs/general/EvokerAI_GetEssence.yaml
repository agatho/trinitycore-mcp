  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetEssence
  signature: int EvokerAI::GetEssence()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current essence resource value of the evoker AI.
  description: The GetEssence method returns the amount of essence currently available
    to the evoker AI. Essence is a core resource in World of Warcraft's Evoker class,
    used for casting spells and abilities. This method provides access to the internal
    essence counter managed by the AI system, allowing scripts and gameplay logic
    to determine how much essence the evoker has for spell usage. The returned value
    typically represents the current amount of essence stored in the AI's state, which
    may be updated based on various game events such as spell casting, gaining essence
    from abilities, or other mechanics specific to the Evoker class.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current essence resource value. This value
    typically ranges from 0 upwards, where 0 indicates no essence available and higher
    values indicate increasing amounts of essence that can be used for casting spells.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check essence amount
    code: "int currentEssence = evokerAI->GetEssence();\nif (currentEssence >= 50)\n\
      {\n    // Cast a high-cost spell\n    evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_HIGH_COST_SPELL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using essence value in conditional logic
    code: "int essence = evokerAI->GetEssence();\nswitch (essence)\n{\n    case 0:\n\
      \        // No essence, cannot cast anything\n        break;\n    case 100:\n\
      \        // Full essence, can cast any spell\n        evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_FULL_ESSENCE_SPELL);\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Partial essence, cast appropriate\
      \ spell\n        evokerAI->CastSpell(SPELL_PARTIAL_ESSENCE_SPELL);\n       \
      \ break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI's decision-making loop to determine
    what actions can be performed based on available essence. The essence value may
    fluctuate during combat and should be checked regularly for accurate spell selection.
    Implementation details suggest this method accesses internal state variables managed
    by the Evoker AI system, so calling it frequently should not cause performance
    issues.
  warnings: Ensure that the evoker AI object is valid before calling this method to
    avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. While essence values are usually
    non-negative integers, always validate return values in critical gameplay logic
    to prevent unexpected behavior when essence reaches zero or maximum capacity.
