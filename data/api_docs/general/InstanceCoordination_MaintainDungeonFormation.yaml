  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: MaintainDungeonFormation
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::MaintainDungeonFormation(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Maintains the formation of a dungeon group by ensuring proper player positioning
    and coordination during instance encounters.
  description: The MaintainDungeonFormation method is responsible for managing the
    spatial arrangement and grouping behavior of players within a dungeon instance.
    This function ensures that group members maintain appropriate distances, follow
    designated paths, and remain properly coordinated during combat encounters and
    movement sequences. It handles dynamic adjustments to group positioning based
    on encounter mechanics, player actions, and instance-specific requirements. The
    method typically operates during active dungeon instances where proper group coordination
    is essential for success. It may also handle cleanup of temporary formations after
    encounters conclude.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the dungeon group that needs
      formation maintenance. This parameter must be a valid group pointer and cannot
      be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Instance
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnPlayerEnterDungeon(Player* player)\n{\n    Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n    {\n        sInstanceCoordination->MaintainDungeonFormation(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Formation Maintenance During Encounter
    code: "void DungeonEncounter::Update()\n{\n    if (m_group)\n    {\n        sInstanceCoordination->MaintainDungeonFormation(m_group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the instance management system
    during dungeon encounters. Developers should not call this method directly unless
    implementing custom group coordination logic. The function may perform various
    checks including group validity, player states, and encounter conditions before
    applying formation adjustments.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group parameter is valid and represents an
    active dungeon instance group before invoking this method.
