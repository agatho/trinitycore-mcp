  class: AuctionHouseMgr
  method: GetAuctionHouseEntry
  signature: const int * AuctionHouseMgr::GetAuctionHouseEntry(uint32 factionTemplateId,
    uint32 * houseId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction house entry associated with a given faction template
    ID.
  description: The GetAuctionHouseEntry method is used to retrieve the auction house
    entry for a specific faction template ID. This function maps faction templates
    to their corresponding auction houses, which is essential for determining where
    players can list items for auction based on their faction. The method takes a
    faction template identifier and an optional pointer to store the house ID, returning
    a pointer to an integer that represents the auction house entry data. It's commonly
    used in auction house-related game logic, such as validating auction actions or
    determining which auction house interface to display to players.
  parameters:
  - name: factionTemplateId
    description: The faction template identifier used to determine which auction house
      entry to retrieve. This value typically corresponds to a faction in the game's
      database.
  - name: houseId
    description: Pointer to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the auction
      house ID if the method succeeds. Can be NULL if the caller does not need this
      information.
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer representing the auction house entry data.
    If no matching entry is found, it may return NULL or a default value depending
    on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve auction house entry
    code: "uint32 factionId = 72; // Example faction ID\nuint32 houseId;\nconst int*\
      \ entry = sAuctionHouseMgr->GetAuctionHouseEntry(factionId, &houseId);\nif (entry\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    // Process the auction house entry\n    printf(\"Auction\
      \ house entry found for faction %u with house ID %u\\n\", factionId, houseId);\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"No auction house entry found for faction %u\\n\", factionId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the method to validate auction actions
    code: "uint32 playerFaction = player->GetFactionTemplateId();\nuint32 houseId;\n\
      const int* entry = sAuctionHouseMgr->GetAuctionHouseEntry(playerFaction, &houseId);\n\
      if (entry != nullptr) {\n    // Proceed with auction listing logic\n    // Use\
      \ houseId to determine which auction house UI to show\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid faction or missing auction house\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You cannot access the auction house with your current faction.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal data structures that map
    faction templates to auction house entries. It's important to note that the returned
    pointer may be invalidated if the internal data changes, so callers should not
    store references to it for extended periods. The method may perform lookups in
    a database or cached lookup tables.
  warnings: The method may return NULL if no matching auction house entry exists for
    the given faction template ID, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not
    properly checked. Additionally, since this is part of the AuctionHouseMgr class,
    ensure thread safety when accessing it from multiple threads.
