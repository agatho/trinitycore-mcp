documentation:
  brief: Sets the action ID and active state type for a unit's action bar entry
  description: Configures the action identifier and active state type associated with
    a specific unit's action bar entry. This method is used to define what action
    (such as a spell, item, or ability) is assigned to a particular slot in the player's
    action bar and determines how that action should be treated within the game's
    active state system. The action ID typically corresponds to a spell, item, or
    other game object identifier, while the active state type defines whether the
    action is currently active, passive, or in another defined state. This method
    directly affects the behavior of the action bar slot and its interaction with
    the player's input and game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: The action identifier to assign to this action bar entry. This typically
      represents a spell ID, item ID, or other game object identifier that defines
      what action will be performed when the slot is activated.
  - name: type
    description: The active state type that determines how the action should be treated
      within the game system. This value specifies whether the action is currently
      active, passive, or in another defined state that affects its behavior and display.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a spell action with active state
    code: 'UnitActionBarEntry* entry = player->GetActionBarEntry(1);

      entry->SetActionAndType(80001, ACTIVE_STATE_ACTIVE); // Assign spell ID 80001
      as an active action'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring an item action with passive state
    code: 'UnitActionBarEntry* entry = player->GetActionBarEntry(5);

      entry->SetActionAndType(12345, ACTIVE_STATE_PASSIVE); // Assign item ID 12345
      as a passive action'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state of the action bar entry and
    should be used carefully. Changes made through this method will immediately affect
    how the action bar slot behaves in-game, including visual display and activation
    behavior. The method does not perform any validation on the action ID or type
    values, so invalid inputs may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Modifying action bar entries directly can cause unexpected behavior if
    the action ID is invalid or the state type is not properly defined. This method
    should only be called when you have a clear understanding of the action being
    assigned and its intended active state. Improper usage may result in broken action
    bar functionality or client/server desynchronization.
