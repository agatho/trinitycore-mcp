documentation:
  brief: Compares two SpellPctModByLabel objects for equality based on their internal
    data members.
  description: The operator== method performs a comparison between this SpellPctModByLabel
    instance and another SpellPctModByLabel object to determine if they are equivalent.
    It checks whether all relevant data members of both objects match exactly, including
    any label identifiers and percentage modifiers associated with the spell effect.
    This comparison is typically used in spell handling systems where multiple spell
    modifications need to be tracked or merged. The method returns true if both objects
    represent identical spell percentage modifications, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining consistency when applying or removing
    spell effects that modify damage or healing percentages by label.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current SpellPctModByLabel object is equal to the right
    operand; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two SpellPctModByLabel objects
    code: 'SpellPctModByLabel mod1;

      SpellPctModByLabel mod2;

      bool isEqual = (mod1 == mod2); // Returns true if both objects have identical
      data members'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is likely implemented using member-wise comparison of all relevant
    fields. It's important to note that this comparison may be used in containers
    like std::set or std::map, where equality and ordering are required for proper
    functioning.
