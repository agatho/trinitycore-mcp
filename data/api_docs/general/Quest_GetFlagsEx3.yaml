  class: Quest
  method: GetFlagsEx3
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetFlagsEx3() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the third set of quest flags that define specific quest properties
    and behaviors.
  description: The GetFlagsEx3 method retrieves the third set of quest flags from
    a quest's data, which governs various advanced quest mechanics such as quest completion
    conditions, special quest types, and unique quest behaviors. These flags are used
    internally by TrinityCore to determine how quests should be handled in terms of
    completion requirements, special interactions, and game-specific behaviors. The
    method is typically used in conjunction with other quest flag methods to fully
    understand a quest's properties and ensure proper handling within the game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the third set of quest flags. This
    value contains specific bits that define quest properties such as whether a quest
    is a daily quest, a weekly quest, or has special completion conditions. Each bit
    corresponds to a specific flag that can be checked using bitwise operations.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Quest Flags
    code: "uint32 flagsEx3 = quest->GetFlagsEx3();\nif (flagsEx3 & QUEST_FLAG_EX3_DAILY)\n\
      {\n    // Quest is a daily quest\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Not a daily quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest flag system in TrinityCore and should be
    used carefully when checking specific flags. The flags are typically defined in
    the database or through game data, and developers should ensure that they understand
    the meaning behind each bit in order to properly interpret the results.
  warnings: The method returns a raw uint32 value; developers must be careful when
    interpreting the bits since different flag values may overlap or have specific
    meanings depending on how the quest was defined. Misinterpretation of flags can
    lead to incorrect quest handling or behavior.
