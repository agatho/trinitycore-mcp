api:
  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: CoordinateGroupForEvent
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::CoordinateGroupForEvent(int * group, uint32
    eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates a group of players for a specific guild event by assigning them
    to appropriate roles or zones.
  description: 'The CoordinateGroupForEvent method manages player assignments within
    a guild event, ensuring that groups are properly organized and distributed across
    event activities. This method likely handles logic such as grouping players based
    on their availability, class distribution, or other criteria relevant to the event
    type. It may also manage synchronization of group states between the game server
    and client interfaces, ensuring all participants are correctly positioned for
    the event. The method operates on a provided integer array representing the group
    members and associates them with a specific event ID. Precondition: The group
    array must contain valid player identifiers, and eventId must reference an existing
    guild event in the system.'
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing player identifiers (GUIDs)
      that constitute the group to be coordinated for the event. Must not be null.
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild event for which the group is being
      coordinated. Should reference a valid event in the guild event system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Coordination
    code: 'int playerGroup[] = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004};

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CoordinateGroupForEvent(playerGroup, 501);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Group Assignment
    code: 'std::vector<int> dynamicGroup = {player1GUID, player2GUID, player3GUID};

      int* groupPtr = dynamicGroup.data();

      coordinator.CoordinateGroupForEvent(groupPtr, currentEventId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild event tracking systems and
    may involve asynchronous operations for distributing assignments to clients. Developers
    should ensure that the group array is properly initialized before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'group' will result in undefined behavior or
    potential crash. Ensure eventId corresponds to an actual registered guild event;
    otherwise, assignment logic may fail silently or assign players incorrectly.
