documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Battlefield Graveyard instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BfGraveyard class is responsible for cleaning
    up all resources allocated during the lifetime of a Battlefield Graveyard object.
    This includes releasing memory, unregistering from game systems, and ensuring
    no dangling references remain. In the context of World of Warcraft's Battlefield
    system, this method ensures that graveyard objects are properly removed from the
    battlefield environment when they are no longer needed. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when a BfGraveyard object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BfGraveyard
    code: "void ExampleFunction() {\n    BfGraveyard* graveyard = new BfGraveyard();\n\
      \    // ... use graveyard ...\n    delete graveyard; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based BfGraveyard destruction
    code: "void AnotherExample() {\n    BfGraveyard graveyard;\n    // ... use graveyard\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when graveyard goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects are destroyed.
    Ensure that all references to the graveyard are cleared before destruction to
    prevent use-after-free errors.
  warnings: Calling the destructor manually on a stack-allocated object will result
    in undefined behavior. The destructor should only be called through proper object
    deletion mechanisms (delete or automatic scope exit).
