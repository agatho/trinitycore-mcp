documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SpatialHostileCache instance as a copy of an existing cache.
  description: The SpatialHostileCache constructor is used to create a new instance
    of the SpatialHostileCache class by copying the contents of another SpatialHostileCache
    object. This method performs a deep copy of the internal data structures that
    store hostile unit references within a specific spatial area. The copied cache
    maintains the same set of hostile targets and their associated spatial information
    as the source cache, allowing for efficient management of hostile units in different
    contexts without duplicating underlying data. This constructor is typically used
    when creating temporary caches or when passing cache instances between different
    systems that require independent copies of the spatial hostile data.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source SpatialHostileCache object to be copied. This parameter
      must be a valid, initialized cache instance containing hostile unit data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying an existing SpatialHostileCache
    code: 'SpatialHostileCache originalCache = GetNearbyHostiles();

      SpatialHostileCache copiedCache(originalCache);

      // Now copiedCache contains the same hostile units as originalCache'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using copy constructor in a function parameter
    code: "void ProcessHostileCache(SpatialHostileCache cache) {\n    // Function\
      \ receives a copy of the cache\n    // Modifications to 'cache' won't affect\
      \ original\n}\n\nSpatialHostileCache mainCache = GetNearbyHostiles();\nProcessHostileCache(mainCache);\
      \ // Passes a copy of mainCache"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a deep copy operation, meaning that any changes
    made to the copied cache will not affect the original cache. The implementation
    likely involves copying internal data structures such as lists or maps of hostile
    units and their spatial coordinates. This ensures thread safety when multiple
    systems access different copies of the same cache simultaneously.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this constructor in performance-critical code paths,
    as deep copying can be expensive if the cache contains many hostile units. Consider
    whether a reference-based approach might be more appropriate for your use case.
