  class: ManagerRegistry
  method: InitializeAll
  signature: uint32 ManagerRegistry::InitializeAll()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes all registered managers within the registry and returns the count
    of successfully initialized managers.
  description: The InitializeAll method iterates through all registered managers in
    the ManagerRegistry and calls their initialization routines. It ensures that all
    subsystems are properly set up before the server begins normal operation. This
    method is typically invoked during server startup to prepare all core systems.
    The method returns the total number of managers that were successfully initialized,
    which can be used for verification or logging purposes. Managers that fail to
    initialize are skipped, and their failure is usually logged by the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of managers that were successfully
    initialized. A return value of zero indicates that no managers were initialized,
    which may suggest a problem with the registry or manager setup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server startup
    code: 'uint32 initializedCount = sManagerRegistry->InitializeAll();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Initialized %u managers", initializedCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called only once during server initialization.
    It's important that all managers are registered before calling this method, otherwise
    they will not be initialized. The method does not guarantee thread safety and
    should typically be called from the main thread.
  warnings: Calling InitializeAll multiple times may lead to undefined behavior or
    resource leaks if managers are not designed to be re-initialized. Ensure that
    no manager dependencies are missing or improperly configured before invoking this
    method.
