documentation:
  brief: Resets the game object's AI state to its initial conditions.
  description: The Reset method is called to reinitialize the AI behavior of a GameObject,
    typically when the object is respawned or when the AI system needs to be restarted.
    This method ensures that all internal AI states, timers, and flags are cleared
    and set back to their default values. It is commonly invoked during the GameObject's
    creation process or when transitioning between different phases of its lifecycle.
    The Reset method does not directly interact with the game world state but prepares
    the AI component for new behavior patterns.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    explicit MyGameObjectAI(GameObject*\
      \ go) : GameObjectAI(go) {}\n    \n    void Reset() override {\n        // Reset\
      \ AI-specific variables\n        _resetTimer = 0;\n        _isActivated = false;\n\
      \        \n        // Call base class reset\n        GameObjectAI::Reset();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Reset method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during object initialization and respawn events. Developers should ensure that
    any custom AI state is properly reset to avoid unexpected behavior. This method
    may be invoked multiple times throughout an object's lifetime, so it must be idempotent.
