documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for destruction warlock abilities
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all ability cooldowns
    for a destruction warlock class instance. This method is typically called during
    character initialization or when a new warlock player enters the game world. It
    ensures that all destruction warlock spells and abilities start with their proper
    cooldown states, preventing immediate usage of powerful abilities like Immolate,
    Conflagrate, or Shadow Bolt. The method handles internal state management for
    tracking spell readiness and ensures proper synchronization with the game's cooldown
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'DestructionWarlockRefactored warlock;

      warlock.InitializeCooldowns();

      // Cooldowns are now properly initialized for the destruction warlock'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during object initialization. Repeated
    calls may result in unexpected cooldown behavior or state corruption. The method
    internally manages spell cooldown timers and should not be manually overridden
    without careful consideration of game balance.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the proper initialization context as
    it may interfere with the normal flow of spell casting and cooldown management.
    This method modifies internal state that affects combat performance.
