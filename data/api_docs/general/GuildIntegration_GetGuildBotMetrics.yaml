api:
  class: GuildIntegration
  method: GetGuildBotMetrics
  signature: GuildMetrics GuildIntegration::GetGuildBotMetrics(uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves comprehensive metrics and statistics for a specified guild bot.
  description: The GetGuildBotMetrics method fetches detailed performance and activity
    data for a guild bot identified by its unique guild ID. This includes information
    such as member count, activity levels, achievements, and other relevant statistical
    data that helps in monitoring and managing guild bot behavior within the World
    of Warcraft environment. The method is designed to provide administrators and
    developers with insights into how guild bots are performing and interacting with
    the game world. It requires a valid guild ID to retrieve the corresponding metrics,
    and will return an empty or default GuildMetrics structure if no matching guild
    bot is found.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GuildMetrics object containing detailed statistics and performance indicators
    for the specified guild bot. If the guild ID does not correspond to an existing
    guild bot, the method returns a default or empty GuildMetrics structure with all
    fields initialized to zero or null values.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Metrics for a Specific Guild Bot
    code: "GuildMetrics metrics = guildIntegration.GetGuildBotMetrics(12345);\nif\
      \ (metrics.MemberCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Guild has \" << metrics.MemberCount\
      \ << \" members.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries and should be used judiciously in
    performance-critical sections of code. The returned GuildMetrics object is a snapshot
    of the current state at the time of the call, and subsequent changes to the guild
    bot's data will not affect previously retrieved metrics unless the method is called
    again.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided guild ID is valid and corresponds to an actual
    guild bot; otherwise, the method may return unexpected or default values. Avoid
    calling this method excessively in tight loops as it could impact server performance.
