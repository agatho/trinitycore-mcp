documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat manager has any active PvE combat with player
    characters.
  description: The HasPvECombatWithPlayers method checks if there is currently active
    Player versus Environment (PvE) combat involving player characters. This includes
    situations where players are engaged in combat with NPCs, creatures, or other
    non-player entities within the game world. The method evaluates the internal state
    of the CombatManager to determine if any such combat interactions exist. It is
    commonly used to prevent certain actions or behaviors during active PvE encounters,
    ensuring proper game mechanics and preventing exploits related to player engagement
    with environment-based content.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there is at least one active PvE combat involving player
    characters; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (combatManager.HasPvECombatWithPlayers()) {\n    // Player is currently\
      \ in PvP combat\n    // Prevent certain actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Logic
    code: "void Player::UpdateCombatState() {\n    if (combatManager.HasPvECombatWithPlayers())\
      \ {\n        // Handle active PvE combat state\n        SetFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS,\
      \ PLAYER_FLAG_IN_COMBAT);\n    } else {\n        // Clear combat state\n   \
      \     RemoveFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS, PLAYER_FLAG_IN_COMBAT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple check on the internal combat state and should
    be efficient to call. It's typically used in conjunction with other combat-related
    methods to maintain proper game state management during player interactions with
    the game world.
