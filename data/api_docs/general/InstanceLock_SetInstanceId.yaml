  class: InstanceLock
  method: SetInstanceId
  signature: void InstanceLock::SetInstanceId(uint32 instanceId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the instance identifier for this instance lock.
  description: The SetInstanceId method assigns a unique instance identifier to an
    InstanceLock object, which is used to track and manage access to specific dungeon
    or raid instances within the World of Warcraft server environment. This method
    is typically called during instance creation or loading processes to associate
    the lock with a particular instance ID. The instance ID serves as a key for identifying
    and managing player access permissions, respawn states, and other instance-specific
    data. This method does not perform any validation on the provided instance ID;
    it simply stores the value internally.
  parameters:
  - name: instanceId
    description: The unique identifier for the instance to be associated with this
      lock. This value should correspond to a valid instance ID used by the TrinityCore
      server to track dungeon or raid instances.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InstanceLock lock;

      lock.SetInstanceId(1234);

      // The lock now references instance ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Instance ID During Instance Creation
    code: "void CreateInstance(uint32 mapId, uint32 difficulty)\n{\n    InstanceLock*\
      \ lock = new InstanceLock();\n    uint32 instanceId = sMapMgr->CreateInstance(mapId,\
      \ difficulty);\n    lock->SetInstanceId(instanceId);\n    // Instance lock is\
      \ now properly initialized with the instance ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly assigns the instance ID without performing any validation.
    Developers should ensure that the provided instance ID is valid and corresponds
    to an actual instance before calling this method. The instance ID is typically
    generated by the MapManager during instance creation.
  warnings: Calling SetInstanceId with an invalid or uninitialized instance ID may
    lead to undefined behavior when accessing instance-related data later. Always
    verify that the instance ID has been properly created and is valid before setting
    it on an InstanceLock object.
