documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the consumable item ID associated with a specified class in the
    game.
  description: The GetClassConsumables method retrieves the consumable item identifier
    that is typically associated with a specific player class in World of Warcraft.
    This functionality is often used to determine which consumable items (such as
    potions or food) are relevant or appropriate for a given class, potentially for
    quest rewards, loot generation, or UI display purposes. The method likely accesses
    internal class-specific data structures or lookup tables within the TrinityCore
    framework to return this value. It does not perform any validation on the input
    class ID, assuming valid class identifiers are passed.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the consumable item ID associated with the specified
    class. A return value of 0 may indicate that no consumable is assigned or that
    an invalid class ID was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve consumable for Warrior class
    code: int warriorConsumable = equipmentManager->GetClassConsumables(CLASS_WARRIOR);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages class-specific
    items and may be used in conjunction with other EquipmentManager functions. It's
    important to ensure that the class ID passed to this function corresponds to valid
    WoW class values (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_MAGE) to avoid unexpected behavior.
