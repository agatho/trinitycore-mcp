    result)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks an interrupt attempt by storing the result of the interruption event.
  description: The TrackInterruptAttempt method records information about a spell
    or ability interruption that occurred during gameplay. This function is typically
    invoked when a player's casting is interrupted by external factors such as damage,
    movement, or other game events. The method stores the provided interrupt result
    data for logging, statistics tracking, or potential future processing within the
    TrinityCore framework. It plays a role in maintaining accurate combat logs and
    ensuring proper handling of interrupted spells.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: The InterruptResult object containing details about the interruption
      event including the caster, target, spell ID, and interruption type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptResult interruptResult;

      interruptResult.casterGuid = player->GetGUID();

      interruptResult.targetGuid = target->GetGUID();

      interruptResult.spellId = spellId;

      interruptResult.interruptType = INTERRUPT_TYPE_DAMAGE;


      interruptManager->TrackInterruptAttempt(interruptResult);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the core game loop to maintain accurate
    interruption tracking. It may be called from various subsystems such as combat
    management, spell casting logic, or event handling modules.
