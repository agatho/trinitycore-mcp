  signature: bool GameObject::IsInSkillupList(const int & playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is in the skillup list for this game object.
  description: This method checks if a specific player, identified by their GUID,
    is included in the skillup list for the current game object. The skillup list
    typically contains players who are eligible to gain skill points from interacting
    with the object. This functionality is crucial for determining which players can
    benefit from skill advancement when interacting with game objects such as anvil,
    milling table, or other craftable items. The method returns true if the player
    is in the skillup list, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check against the skillup
      list. This parameter must be a valid GUID for the method to function correctly.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is in the skillup list for this game
    object, false otherwise. The return value indicates whether the player can gain
    skill points from interacting with this object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "GameObject* go = ...;\nPlayer* player = ...;\nbool isInSkillupList = go->IsInSkillupList(player->GetGUID());\n\
      if (isInSkillupList)\n{\n    // Player can gain skill points from this object\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal game object state and may involve performance
    considerations when checking multiple players. It is recommended to cache the
    player GUID for efficiency in frequent checks.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining whether a player can interact
    with an object, as it only checks for skillup eligibility. The player must have
    proper access rights to the object before attempting to use this method.
