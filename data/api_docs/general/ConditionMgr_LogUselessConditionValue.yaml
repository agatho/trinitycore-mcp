  class: ConditionMgr
  method: LogUselessConditionValue
  signature: void ConditionMgr::LogUselessConditionValue(const Condition * cond, uint8
    index, int value)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a message indicating that a condition value is useless or invalid.
  description: The LogUselessConditionValue method records information about a condition
    that has been evaluated but found to have an invalid or meaningless value. This
    typically occurs during the evaluation of game conditions, such as those used
    in quest requirements, spell effects, or other conditional gameplay elements.
    The method helps developers identify and debug problematic conditions in the game
    logic by logging when certain values are encountered that do not contribute meaningfully
    to the condition's outcome. It is primarily used for debugging and maintaining
    the integrity of conditional systems within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: cond
    description: Pointer to the Condition object being evaluated. This represents
      the specific condition structure containing the logic and parameters that are
      being checked.
  - name: index
    description: The index of the condition parameter being logged. This indicates
      which specific value within the condition is considered useless or invalid.
  - name: value
    description: The integer value of the condition parameter that was found to be
      useless or invalid. This could be a quest requirement, item ID, or other numeric
      condition value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in condition evaluation
    code: "void SomeConditionHandler::EvaluateCondition(Condition* cond, uint8 index,\
      \ int value)\n{\n    if (value <= 0)\n    {\n        sConditionMgr->LogUselessConditionValue(cond,\
      \ index, value);\n        // Handle invalid condition\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during debug builds or when verbose logging
    is enabled. It does not modify any game state and serves purely for diagnostic
    purposes. The logging output can be used to identify problematic quest conditions,
    spell effects, or other conditional systems that may need adjustment.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers will likely result in a crash.
    Ensure that the Condition pointer is valid before calling this function. This
    method should not be called in performance-critical code paths as it involves
    logging operations which can impact performance.
