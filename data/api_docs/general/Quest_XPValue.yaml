  class: Quest
  method: XPValue
  signature: uint32 Quest::XPValue(const Player * player, uint32 contentTuningId,
    uint32 xpDifficulty, float xpMultiplier, int32 expansion)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the experience points (XP) reward for completing a
    quest based on player, content tuning, difficulty, multiplier, and expansion parameters.
  description: The XPValue method computes the base experience points that a player
    will receive upon completing a quest. It takes into account various factors including
    the player's current level, the quest's intended difficulty, content tuning settings,
    an XP multiplier, and the game expansion context. This calculation is crucial
    for determining quest rewards in World of Warcraft's progression system. The method
    ensures that players receive appropriate XP scaling based on their character's
    level and the content they are engaging with, while also respecting game balance
    adjustments through content tuning and expansion-specific modifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the XP value is being calculated.
      This determines the player's level and other relevant attributes that affect
      XP reward scaling.
  - name: contentTuningId
    description: Identifier for content tuning settings that modify quest difficulty
      and rewards. Used to adjust XP values based on specific content or instance
      configurations.
  - name: xpDifficulty
    description: Difficulty level modifier for XP calculation. Controls how much XP
      is awarded relative to the quest's intended difficulty, typically based on quest
      level compared to player level.
  - name: xpMultiplier
    description: Floating-point multiplier applied to the base XP value. Can be used
      to adjust XP rewards globally or for specific events, achievements, or game
      mechanics.
  - name: expansion
    description: Integer representing the game expansion context (e.g., 0 = Vanilla,
      1 = The Burning Crusade, etc.). Affects XP calculations based on expansion-specific
      rules and scaling.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated experience points that
    the player will receive upon completing this quest. This value is derived from
    base quest XP adjusted by player level, difficulty, content tuning, multiplier,
    and expansion settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic XP Calculation
    code: 'uint32 xp = quest->XPValue(player, 0, 1, 1.0f, 2);

      // Calculates XP for a player completing a quest with default tuning, normal
      difficulty, no multiplier, and Wrath of the Lich King expansion'
    language: cpp
  - title: XP Calculation with Multiplier
    code: 'uint32 xp = quest->XPValue(player, 1001, 2, 1.5f, 3);

      // Calculates XP for a player completing a quest in a specific content tuning
      (ID 1001), higher difficulty, 1.5x multiplier, and Cataclysm expansion'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest completion processing to determine
    the XP reward. The calculation considers multiple factors including player level,
    quest level, and various game balance settings. It's important to note that this
    returns only the base XP value; additional modifiers like quest completion bonuses
    or achievements may be applied separately.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters. Passing invalid contentTuningId
    or expansion values may result in incorrect XP calculations. Ensure player object
    is valid and not null before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
