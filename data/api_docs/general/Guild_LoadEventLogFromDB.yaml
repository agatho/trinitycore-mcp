  class: Guild
  method: LoadEventLogFromDB
  signature: bool Guild::LoadEventLogFromDB(int * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads the guild's event log from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadEventLogFromDB method retrieves all recorded events from the
    guild's event log table in the database and populates the internal event log structure.
    This method is typically called during guild initialization or when the guild
    data needs to be refreshed from the persistent storage. It ensures that all recent
    guild activities such as member joins, leaves, promotions, demotions, and other
    significant events are available for retrieval and display to guild members. The
    method performs a database query to fetch event log entries ordered by timestamp
    and stores them in memory for quick access.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the event log was successfully loaded from the database;
    otherwise returns false if there was an error during the database operation or
    data retrieval.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Guild Initialization
    code: "Guild* guild = new Guild();\nif (guild->LoadEventLogFromDB(nullptr)) {\n\
      \    // Event log loaded successfully\n    // Can now access guild event logs\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle load failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database connection is already established and
    valid. The internal event log structure must be properly initialized before calling
    this method. Performance may be impacted if the guild has a large number of events
    in its log, as all entries are loaded at once.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the guild's database
    connection or internal structures may lead to undefined behavior. This method
    should not be called concurrently with other methods that modify the event log
    structure to avoid race conditions.
