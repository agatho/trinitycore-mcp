  brief: Initializes a new BotScheduler instance as a copy of an existing scheduler
  description: The BotScheduler constructor creates a new scheduler instance by copying
    the state and configuration from an existing BotScheduler object. This copy constructor
    ensures that all internal scheduling data, task queues, and configuration parameters
    are duplicated to the new instance. The method is typically used when creating
    multiple scheduler instances that should share the same initial setup or when
    cloning an existing scheduler configuration for independent manipulation. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment, this allows bot systems to maintain consistent
    scheduling behavior across different instances while enabling isolated modifications.

  - title: Basic Copy Construction
    code: 'BotScheduler originalScheduler;

      // Configure originalScheduler...

      BotScheduler newScheduler(originalScheduler); // Creates copy of original'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the scheduler's internal state.
    Any modifications to shared resources between the original and copied instances
    may affect both schedulers if they reference the same data structures. The implementation
    should ensure thread safety when multiple threads access scheduler instances concurrently.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this constructor with schedulers that manage shared
    resources or tasks. Changes to one instance might inadvertently affect another
    if they share references to mutable objects. Consider deep copying semantics for
    complex scheduler configurations.
