  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: ExploreZone
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::ExploreZone(uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates exploration of a specified zone for the player's current AI behavior.
  description: The ExploreZone method triggers the AI behavior manager to begin exploring
    a given zone, typically used in advanced AI scripts to dynamically assign exploration
    tasks to NPCs or players. This method is commonly employed in custom AI implementations
    where zone exploration is part of a quest or objective system. The zone ID parameter
    specifies which area should be explored, and the method likely updates internal
    state tracking for exploration progress. It may also interact with the player's
    quest log or exploration map data depending on implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone to be explored. This value corresponds
      to the ZoneID field in the game's database tables, typically referencing areas
      such as cities, dungeons, or outdoor zones.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Zone Exploration
    code: "void MyCustomAI::OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n\
      \    if (quest->GetQuestId() == 12345)\n    {\n        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->ExploreZone(123);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Zone Exploration
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_player && m_player->GetZoneId()\
      \ == 456)\n    {\n        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->ExploreZone(456);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal AI state variables related to exploration
    progress and may trigger events or callbacks when exploration is completed. It
    should only be called during active AI update cycles to avoid concurrency issues.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid zone ID may result in undefined behavior
    or silent failures. Ensure that the zone ID exists in the game's database before
    invoking this function.
