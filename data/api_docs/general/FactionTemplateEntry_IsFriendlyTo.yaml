  class: FactionTemplateEntry
  method: IsFriendlyTo
  signature: bool FactionTemplateEntry::IsFriendlyTo(const FactionTemplateEntry *
    entry) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether this faction template is friendly toward another faction
    template.
  description: The IsFriendlyTo method evaluates the relationship between two faction
    templates and returns true if they are considered friendly to each other. This
    determination is based on the faction template's internal flags and relationships
    defined in the game's faction system. The method does not consider dynamic faction
    changes or player-specific reputation, but rather checks the static template definitions.
    It is commonly used in game logic to control interactions such as combat eligibility,
    quest availability, and NPC dialogue options.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: A pointer to another FactionTemplateEntry object that represents
      the faction template to compare against. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if this faction template is friendly toward the provided entry,
    false otherwise. The result depends on predefined faction relationships and flags
    within the TrinityCore faction system.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Faction Friendship
    code: "FactionTemplateEntry* playerFaction = sFactionTemplateStore.LookupEntry(player->GetFactionTemplateId());\n\
      FactionTemplateEntry* npcFaction = sFactionTemplateStore.LookupEntry(npc->getFaction());\n\
      if (playerFaction && npcFaction && playerFaction->IsFriendlyTo(npcFaction))\n\
      {\n    // Player and NPC are friendly\n    SendGreeting();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only evaluates static faction template data. Dynamic reputation
    changes or temporary faction modifications are not considered in the result. The
    implementation relies on faction flags such as FRIEND, HOSTILE, etc., which are
    defined in the DBC files.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided entry parameter is valid and not null to avoid
    undefined behavior. This method should not be used for dynamic reputation checks;
    it only reflects static faction template relationships.
