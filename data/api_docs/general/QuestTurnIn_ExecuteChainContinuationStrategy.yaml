  method: ExecuteChainContinuationStrategy
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ExecuteChainContinuationStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the chain continuation strategy for a bot player during quest turn-in.
  description: The ExecuteChainContinuationStrategy method determines and applies
    the appropriate follow-up actions for a bot player after completing a quest. This
    includes evaluating whether to continue with a quest chain, select alternative
    objectives, or proceed to the next available quest in the player's active quest
    log. The method typically integrates with the bot's decision-making system to
    ensure seamless progression through quest chains while maintaining proper quest
    state management. It is commonly invoked during quest completion events and may
    involve checking prerequisites, updating quest status, and triggering subsequent
    quest acceptance or turn-in logic.

  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Completion Handler
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player) {\n    if (player->IsBot()) {\n  \
      \      QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;\n        questTurnIn.ExecuteChainContinuationStrategy(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player is a bot and that the quest completion state
    has already been properly updated in the game world. The implementation likely
    interacts with internal quest tracking systems and may depend on the bot's current
    quest log state to determine continuation paths.
  warnings: Calling this method on non-bot players or without proper quest state management
    may lead to unexpected behavior or quest progression issues. Ensure that all prerequisite
    conditions for quest continuation are met before invoking this method.
