documentation:
  brief: Initializes movement spline data for entering a transport vehicle
  description: The SetTransportEnter method configures the movement spline initialization
    to handle the scenario where a player or creature is boarding a transport vehicle
    such as a boat, zeppelin, or elevator. This method sets up the necessary spline
    parameters and flags to ensure smooth transition into transport movement mode.
    It typically gets called internally by the core movement system when a unit enters
    a transport's passenger area. The method prepares the spline for subsequent movement
    updates that will track the transport's position and orientation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in transport boarding logic
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetTransportEnter();

      // Subsequent calls to splineInit.Move() will now account for transport movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore movement
    system when a unit enters transport bounds. Developers should not call this directly
    unless implementing custom transport boarding logic. The method modifies internal
    spline state and prepares for subsequent transport-relative movement calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper transport context may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect movement tracking. It should only be used when a unit is
    actually entering a valid transport vehicle.
