  class: CCChain
  method: CCChain
  signature: void CCChain::CCChain()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new CCChain object for handling chain-based combat effects
    in World of Warcraft.
  description: The CCChain constructor initializes a new instance of the CCChain class,
    which is used to manage and execute chain-based crowd control effects within the
    TrinityCore framework. This class typically handles chaining of effects such as
    those from spells like Hamstring or Frost Shock, where one effect can trigger
    another in sequence. The initialization process sets up internal state variables
    and prepares the object for use in combat scenarios. This constructor is generally
    called when creating new chain effect instances during spell processing or combat
    event handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CCChain Initialization
    code: 'CCChain* chain = new CCChain();

      // The chain object is now ready to be used in combat effects

      chain->ExecuteChain();'
    language: cpp
  - title: CCChain with Spell Effect Integration
    code: "void ApplyChainEffect(Unit* caster, Unit* target) {\n    CCChain* chain\
      \ = new CCChain();\n    chain->SetCaster(caster);\n    chain->SetTarget(target);\n\
      \    chain->ExecuteChain();\n    delete chain;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the spell system when
    processing chain effects. Developers should ensure proper memory management when
    using CCChain objects, as they may require explicit deletion after use. The class
    likely maintains internal references to affected units and spell data that must
    be properly initialized during construction.
  warnings: Improper initialization of CCChain objects can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes during combat processing. Always ensure that the object is fully constructed
    before calling any methods on it, especially in high-frequency combat scenarios
    where performance is critical.
