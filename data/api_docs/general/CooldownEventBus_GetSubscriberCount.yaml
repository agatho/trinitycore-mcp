  signature: uint32 CooldownEventBus::GetSubscriberCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of subscribers currently registered with the cooldown
    event bus.
  description: The GetSubscriberCount method retrieves the current count of subscribers
    that are registered with the CooldownEventBus. This is typically used to monitor
    or debug the event subscription system, ensuring that the correct number of listeners
    are attached to cooldown-related events. The method performs a thread-safe read
    operation on an internal counter that tracks subscriber registrations. It does
    not modify any state and can be called at any time during runtime without side
    effects. This functionality is particularly useful in systems where cooldown events
    need to be tracked for performance optimization or event-driven behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of subscribers currently registered
    with the CooldownEventBus. Returns zero if no subscribers are registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 subscriberCount = sCooldownEventBus->GetSubscriberCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Current cooldown event subscribers: %u", subscriberCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Subscriber Count
    code: "void CheckCooldownEventBusHealth()\n{\n    uint32 count = sCooldownEventBus->GetSubscriberCount();\n\
      \    if (count > 100)\n    {\n        TC_LOG_WARN(\"misc\", \"High subscriber\
      \ count detected: %u\", count);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is implemented as a constant function and does not modify internal
    state. It relies on an atomic counter for thread safety, making it safe to call
    from multiple threads concurrently. The returned value reflects the count at the
    time of the method call and may change immediately after due to concurrent subscription/unsubscription
    operations.
  warnings: While this method is thread-safe, calling it in a high-frequency loop
    could introduce performance overhead if the internal counter mechanism is not
    optimized for frequent reads. Also, the subscriber count may be outdated immediately
    after being retrieved, as subscriptions can change concurrently.
