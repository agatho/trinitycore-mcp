  method: PlayerUnbannedAppend
  signature: void PlayerUnbannedAppend::PlayerUnbannedAppend(const int & moderator,
    const int & unbanned)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a player unbanning event with moderator and unbanned player IDs.
  description: The PlayerUnbannedAppend method records information about a player
    being unbanned from the game server. This method is typically invoked when an
    administrator or moderator lifts a ban from a player account. It logs the action
    in the database or system logs, associating the unbanning event with the moderator
    who performed it and the player who was unbanned. The method does not directly
    perform the unbanning itself but rather appends this information to the system's
    audit trail for accountability purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: moderator
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the moderator or administrator who
      performed the unbanning action.
  - name: unbanned
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player account that was unbanned
      from the server.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: PlayerUnbannedAppend(12345, 67890);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Variable Values
    code: 'int moderatorId = GetModeratorGUID();

      int playerId = GetBannedPlayerGUID();

      PlayerUnbannedAppend(moderatorId, playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player management system and should be called
    after a successful unbanning operation. It assumes that both moderator and unbanned
    player IDs are valid and exist in the database. The method may perform logging
    or database write operations, so it's recommended to ensure proper error handling
    around these calls.
  warnings: Ensure that the moderator and unbanned player GUIDs are validated before
    calling this method to prevent invalid data from being logged. Improper use could
    lead to incorrect audit logs or database inconsistencies.
