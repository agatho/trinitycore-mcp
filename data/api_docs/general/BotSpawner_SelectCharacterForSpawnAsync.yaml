  class: BotSpawner
  method: SelectCharacterForSpawnAsync
  signature: void BotSpawner::SelectCharacterForSpawnAsync(const int & request, int
    callback)
documentation:
  brief: Asynchronously selects a character for bot spawning based on the provided
    request identifier.
  description: The SelectCharacterForSpawnAsync method initiates an asynchronous operation
    to choose a suitable character for spawning a bot within the World of Warcraft
    environment. This function is typically used in conjunction with bot management
    systems where multiple bots need to be spawned dynamically. The method takes a
    request identifier and a callback function that will be invoked upon completion
    of the selection process. It does not block execution while waiting for the character
    selection, allowing other operations to proceed concurrently. The underlying logic
    likely involves checking available characters, their availability, and possibly
    their suitability for specific bot roles or configurations.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier representing the spawn request. This value
      is used to track and correlate the asynchronous operation with its corresponding
      request context.
  - name: callback
    description: An integer identifier for the callback function that will be executed
      once character selection is complete. This allows the system to handle results
      asynchronously without blocking execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of SelectCharacterForSpawnAsync
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner;

      int requestId = 12345;

      int callbackId = 67890;

      spawner.SelectCharacterForSpawnAsync(requestId, callbackId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be non-blocking and should only be used in environments
    where asynchronous operations are supported. The actual character selection logic
    may involve database queries or internal state checks that are deferred until
    the next update cycle.
  warnings: Ensure that the callback function referenced by 'callback' parameter is
    properly registered and accessible within the execution context, as failure to
    do so could result in undefined behavior or crashes.
