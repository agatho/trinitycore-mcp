documentation:
  brief: Loads the list of achievement references from the database into memory for
    use during runtime.
  description: The LoadAchievementReferenceList method initializes and populates an
    internal data structure with all achievement references stored in the database.
    This method is typically called during server startup or when the achievement
    system needs to refresh its reference data. It ensures that all achievements are
    properly loaded and accessible for evaluation, tracking, and reward distribution
    during gameplay. The method does not take any parameters and performs no direct
    return operations; instead, it updates internal state for the AchievementGlobalMgr
    class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: AchievementGlobalMgr::instance()->LoadAchievementReferenceList();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a full reload of achievement data is required. It may cause performance overhead
    if invoked frequently due to database queries and memory allocations.
  warnings: Invoking this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    duplicate entries in internal data structures, potentially causing incorrect achievement
    evaluation results.
