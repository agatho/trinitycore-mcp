documentation:
  brief: Returns the required skill ID for an item.
  description: The GetRequiredSkill method retrieves the skill ID that a player must
    have to be able to use the item. This is used in conjunction with the minimum
    skill level requirement to determine if a character can equip or use the item.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this value corresponds to the
    SkillLine table entry that defines the required profession or skill for the item.
    If the returned value is 0, it typically means no specific skill is required to
    use the item.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 representing the ID of the required skill from the SkillLine database
    table. A return value of 0 indicates that no skill is required for using this
    item.
  examples:
  - title: Check Required Skill for an Item
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32\
      \ requiredSkill = itemTemplate->GetRequiredSkill();\nif (requiredSkill != 0)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"This item requires skill ID: %u\\n\", requiredSkill);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    printf(\"No skill is required to use this item.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned skill ID maps directly to entries in the SkillLine database
    table. Developers should verify that the skill exists before using it for validation
    logic. This method does not perform any runtime checks on whether a player actually
    has the required skill; it only returns the configured value from the item template.
  warnings: "Ensure that the ItemTemplate object is valid and properly loaded before\
    \ calling this method, as accessing an invalid template may lead to undefined\
    \ behavior. Also note that a return value of 0 does not necessarily mean the item\
    \ is usable by everyone\u2014it could indicate that skill requirements are handled\
    \ differently in other parts of the system."
