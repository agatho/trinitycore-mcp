documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has explored the specified zone.
  description: This method determines if a player has discovered and explored a particular
    area, returning true if the zone has been explored and false otherwise. The method
    is commonly used in game mechanics to check exploration status of zones, which
    can affect quest completion, achievement unlocking, and other gameplay elements.
    It relies on the player's exploration data stored in their character database,
    specifically the exploration data that tracks which zones have been discovered
    by the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has explored the specified zone, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->HasExploredZone(1234)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "if (player->HasExploredZone(1234) && player->HasExploredZone(5678)) {\n\
      \    // Do something when both zones are explored\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally checks the player's exploration data stored in the
    database. It is thread-safe and does not require any special conditions to be
    met. Performance-wise, this method is lightweight as it only performs a simple
    lookup in the player's exploration data.
