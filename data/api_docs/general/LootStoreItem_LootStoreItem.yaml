    bool _needs_quest, uint16 _lootmode, uint8 _groupid, uint8 _mincount, uint8 _maxcount)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a loot item entry with specified properties for use in loot systems.
  description: The LootStoreItem constructor initializes a loot item with key parameters
    that define how the item will be dropped or awarded during loot generation. It
    sets up essential metadata such as item ID, loot type, drop chance, quest requirements,
    loot mode, group ID, and quantity ranges. This method is typically used internally
    by the loot system to build loot templates for creatures, game objects, or treasure
    chests. The parameters control various aspects of how the loot behaves in different
    game contexts, including whether it requires a quest to be obtainable, what loot
    modes it's available in, and how many items can be dropped in a single loot event.
  parameters:
  - name: _itemid
    description: The unique identifier of the item to be added to the loot store.
      Must correspond to a valid item entry in the database.
  - name: _type
    description: The type of loot this item represents (e.g., normal, quest, disenchant).
      Defines how the item interacts with loot rules and restrictions.
  - name: _chance
    description: The probability of this item being selected during loot generation,
      expressed as a percentage (0.0 to 100.0).
  - name: _needs_quest
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the item requires a specific quest
      to be obtainable. If true, the player must have the required quest in their
      log.
  - name: _lootmode
    description: The loot mode bitmask that determines when this item can be rolled
      for. Used to control loot distribution across different difficulty levels or
      game modes.
  - name: _groupid
    description: The group identifier used for grouping related items together in
      loot rolls. Items with the same group ID are mutually exclusive during a single
      roll.
  - name: _mincount
    description: The minimum number of items that can be awarded when this item is
      dropped (must be >= 0).
  - name: _maxcount
    description: The maximum number of items that can be awarded when this item is
      dropped (must be >= _mincount).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Loot Item Initialization
    code: LootStoreItem item(12345, LootStoreItem::NORMAL, 50.0f, false, 1, 0, 1,
      3);
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Item with Grouping
    code: LootStoreItem questItem(67890, LootStoreItem::QUEST, 100.0f, true, 1, 1,
      1, 1);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal loot system infrastructure and is usually
    called during server initialization or when loading loot templates from database
    entries. The group ID is crucial for proper loot distribution logic where items
    in the same group cannot both drop in one loot event. The chance value should
    be carefully balanced to ensure appropriate rarity and gameplay experience.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting mincount > maxcount will result in undefined behavior
    or runtime errors. Setting _needs_quest to true without proper quest entries in
    the database may cause items to never appear in loot. Be cautious when using group
    IDs - if multiple items share the same group ID, only one of them can drop per
    loot event.
