  brief: Loads and initializes UI map quest data for the game world
  description: The LoadUiMapQuests method is responsible for loading quest-related
    data that is displayed on the user interface maps within the World of Warcraft
    game. This includes mapping quests to specific locations, zones, and objectives
    shown on the minimap and world map. The method typically reads from database tables
    containing quest information and prepares internal data structures necessary for
    quest tracking and display. It is part of the ObjectMgr class which manages various
    game objects and their associated data during server initialization and runtime.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Startup

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when reloading quest
    data. It may involve database queries and memory allocation for quest-related
    structures. The method should be thread-safe as it's often invoked during initialization
    phases.
  warnings: This method modifies internal game state and should not be called during
    active gameplay without proper synchronization. Improper execution could result
    in missing quest markers on maps or incorrect quest tracking information.
