  class: TransportBase
  method: RemovePassenger
  signature: TransportBase * TransportBase::RemovePassenger(WorldObject * passenger)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a passenger from the transport and returns a pointer to the transport
    object.
  description: The RemovePassenger method removes a specified WorldObject (typically
    a player or creature) from the transport system. It is used when a passenger needs
    to be dismounted from a transport such as a boat, zeppelin, or other moving vehicle
    in the game world. The method updates internal transport passenger lists and handles
    necessary cleanup operations. This function is typically called internally by
    the game engine during passenger movement or when a passenger leaves the transport
    area. It ensures that the passenger's position is updated to reflect their new
    location outside of the transport.
  parameters:
  - name: passenger
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject (player or creature) that should be
      removed from the transport. Must not be null and must be a valid object currently
      on this transport.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the TransportBase object that had the passenger removed.
    This allows for method chaining if needed, though typically the return value is
    not used in most cases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage removing a player from a transport
    code: 'TransportBase* transport = ...; // Get reference to transport

      Player* player = ...; // Get reference to player on transport

      TransportBase* result = transport->RemovePassenger(player);

      // The player is now removed from the transport'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing multiple passengers in a loop
    code: "TransportBase* transport = ...;\nfor (auto& passenger : transport->GetPassengers())\
      \ {\n    if (passenger && passenger->IsPlayer()) {\n        transport->RemovePassenger(passenger);\n\
      \    }\n}\n// All player passengers have been removed from the transport"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal transport management system in TrinityCore.
    It handles proper cleanup of passenger state and ensures that the transport's
    internal passenger list is updated correctly. The method does not directly handle
    teleportation or position updates for the passenger; those are handled separately
    by the game engine.
  warnings: Ensure that the passenger pointer passed to this method is valid and currently
    on the transport, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Do not call this method
    with null pointers as it will likely cause crashes or memory corruption.
