  class: FleeingMovementGenerator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void FleeingMovementGenerator::Initialize(int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the fleeing movement generator with a target owner reference.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the FleeingMovementGenerator by assigning
    the provided owner reference to internal tracking variables. This method is typically
    called during the initialization phase of an AI movement behavior when a creature
    needs to begin fleeing from a specified target. The method prepares the movement
    generator for subsequent pathfinding and movement execution, ensuring that the
    fleeing behavior has access to the necessary target information. It does not perform
    any actual movement calculations but rather configures the internal state required
    for the fleeing logic to operate correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the creature
      or unit that owns this movement generator. This value is used internally to
      track which entity is currently executing the fleeing behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'FleeingMovementGenerator fleeGen;

      int ownerID = 12345;

      fleeGen.Initialize(&ownerID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any movement execution occurs. The owner
    parameter is expected to be a valid pointer to an integer identifier, typically
    representing a creature's GUID or similar unique identifier within the TrinityCore
    framework.
