documentation:
  brief: Removes all players from the map instance.
  description: The RemoveAllPlayers method removes all player objects currently present
    in the map instance. This operation typically occurs when a map is being destroyed,
    reset, or transitioned to a different state. The method ensures that all players
    are properly removed from the map's internal tracking systems and their associated
    game objects are cleaned up. It may also trigger necessary cleanup routines for
    player-related data structures and prevent memory leaks. This method is commonly
    used during map transitions, instance resets, or server shutdown procedures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in map reset
    code: "void InstanceMap::Reset()\n{\n    // Remove all players before resetting\
      \ the instance\n    RemoveAllPlayers();\n    // Perform other reset operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage during map destruction
    code: "Map::~Map()\n{\n    // Ensure all players are removed before destruction\n\
      \    RemoveAllPlayers();\n    // Clean up remaining resources\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through all active players on the map and calls
    their removal routines. It may involve synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread
    safety during player removal operations. The method is typically called internally
    by the core system rather than directly by scripts or modules.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are actively interacting with the map
    can cause undefined behavior or crashes if not properly synchronized. This method
    should only be invoked when it's safe to remove all players from the map without
    causing game state inconsistencies.
