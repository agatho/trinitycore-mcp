documentation:
  brief: Returns the reputation manager instance for the player.
  description: The GetReputationMgr method retrieves the ReputationMgr object associated
    with the player, which manages all reputation-related data including faction standings,
    reputation gains, and reputation modifiers. This method provides access to the
    player's current reputation state within the game world, allowing developers to
    query or modify reputation values for various factions. The returned reference
    is const, meaning it cannot be modified directly but can be used for reading reputation
    information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a constant reference to the ReputationMgr object associated with
    the player, enabling access to all faction-related reputation data without modifying
    the original instance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Player Reputation
    code: 'const ReputationMgr& repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();

      uint32 factionId = repMgr.GetReputation(0);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and does not require any special considerations
    for usage. It returns a const reference to avoid modification of the reputation
    manager object directly.
