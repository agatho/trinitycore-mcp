documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the paladin has sufficient holy power to cast a specified
    spell
  description: The HasHolyPowerFor method evaluates if the PaladinAI instance possesses
    enough holy power resources to execute a given spell. This method is crucial for
    AI decision-making in spell selection, ensuring that only viable spells are considered
    based on current resource availability. The evaluation takes into account the
    specific holy power cost of the target spell and compares it against the paladin's
    current holy power reserves. It serves as a validation check before attempting
    to cast spells that require holy power, preventing invalid or inefficient AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the paladin has sufficient holy power to cast the specified
    spell; otherwise returns false. The method considers the holy power cost of the
    spell against the current holy power resource level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (paladinAI->HasHolyPowerFor(SPELL_HOLY_SHOCK)) {\n    // Execute Holy\
      \ Shock since sufficient holy power is available\n    paladinAI->CastSpell(SPELL_HOLY_SHOCK);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting with Resource Check
    code: "if (paladinAI->HasHolyPowerFor(SPELL_JUDGMENT_OF_LIGHT)) {\n    // Cast\
      \ Judgment of Light when holy power is sufficient\n    paladinAI->CastSpell(SPELL_JUDGMENT_OF_LIGHT);\n\
      } else if (paladinAI->HasHolyPowerFor(SPELL_HOLY_SHOCK)) {\n    // Fallback\
      \ to Holy Shock if Judgment is not affordable\n    paladinAI->CastSpell(SPELL_HOLY_SHOCK);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal holy power tracking system of the PaladinAI.
    It should be called before attempting to cast any spell that consumes holy power
    to avoid invalid spell casts. The method does not modify any state and is purely
    a query operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId passed to this method corresponds to a valid paladin
    spell that actually requires holy power, otherwise the behavior may be undefined
    or misleading. This method should not be used as a sole indicator for spell selection
    without considering other factors like target conditions or cooldowns.
