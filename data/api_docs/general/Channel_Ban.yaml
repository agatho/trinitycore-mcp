  class: Channel
  method: Ban
  signature: void Channel::Ban(const Player * player, const std::string & badname)
documentation:
  brief: Bans a player from the channel by adding their name to the ban list.
  description: The Ban method adds a specified player's name to the channel's ban
    list, preventing them from joining or communicating in the channel. This action
    is typically invoked when a player violates channel rules or engages in disruptive
    behavior. The method takes the player object and the name of the banned player
    as parameters, ensuring that the ban is applied correctly within the channel context.
    It does not return any value, indicating that it performs an action rather than
    computing a result.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the player who is initiating
      the ban command.
  - name: badname
    description: A string containing the name of the player to be banned from the
      channel.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Ban Usage
    code: 'Channel* channel = ...; // Assume channel is initialized

      Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      channel->Ban(player, "EvilUser");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal channel management system
    and may trigger updates to the channel's state or broadcast messages to other
    members. It should only be called when the player has sufficient permissions to
    ban others in the channel.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also,
    verify that the badname is properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks or
    malformed data issues.
