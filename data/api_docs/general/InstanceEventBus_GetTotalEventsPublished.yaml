documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of events published through the instance event bus
  description: The GetTotalEventsPublished method retrieves the cumulative count of
    all events that have been published via this InstanceEventBus instance. This counter
    is typically used for monitoring, debugging, or performance analysis purposes
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method is thread-safe and provides a consistent
    view of the total event volume across all subscribers and event types. It does
    not reset or modify any internal state; it simply reports the current tally.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total number of events published through
    this instance of InstanceEventBus since its initialization or last reset.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Event Monitoring
    code: 'InstanceEventBus* eventBus = sScriptMgr->GetMapEventBus(mapId);

      uint64 totalEvents = eventBus->GetTotalEventsPublished();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server.loading", "Map %u has published %llu events so far.", mapId,
      totalEvents);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis with Event Counting
    code: "void LogInstanceEventStats()\n{\n    for (auto& pair : sMapMgr->GetAllMapEventBuses())\n\
      \    {\n        uint64 total = pair.second->GetTotalEventsPublished();\n   \
      \     if (total > 0)\n            TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"eventbus\", \"Instance %u published\
      \ %llu events\", pair.first, total);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable
    for frequent calls in performance-critical sections. The internal counter is incremented
    atomically, ensuring thread safety without performance penalties.
