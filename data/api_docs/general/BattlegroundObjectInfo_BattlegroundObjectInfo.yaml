  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BattlegroundObjectInfo class with default
    values.
  description: The BattlegroundObjectInfo constructor initializes a new instance of
    the BattlegroundObjectInfo class. This class is used to store information about
    objects within a battleground, such as doors, banners, or other interactive elements.
    The constructor sets up default values for all member variables, ensuring that
    the object is in a valid state upon creation. This initialization is crucial for
    proper gameplay mechanics and object management within battleground scenarios.

  - title: Basic instantiation of BattlegroundObjectInfo
    code: 'BattlegroundObjectInfo bgObjectInfo;

      // Creates a new BattlegroundObjectInfo instance with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the battleground system
    when creating object entries. Developers should not need to manually instantiate
    this class unless implementing custom battleground logic or object handling.
