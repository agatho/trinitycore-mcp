documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a trigger condition is met for the provided bot AI context
  description: The Check method determines if a specific trigger condition has been
    satisfied within the context of a bot AI instance. This method is typically used
    in TrinityCore's AI system to evaluate when certain events or states should activate
    scripted behaviors. It performs internal logic checks against the AI's current
    state and environment to return a boolean result indicating whether the trigger
    should be activated. The method does not modify any state but rather assesses
    conditions for decision-making purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trigger condition is currently met, false otherwise.
    This boolean value indicates whether the AI should proceed with actions associated
    with this trigger.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Check Usage
    code: "if (trigger->Check(ai)) {\n    // Execute trigger-specific behavior\n \
      \   ai->DoAction(TRIGGER_ACTION);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "class MyTrigger : public Trigger {\npublic:\n    bool Check(BotAI* ai)\
      \ const override {\n        return ai->GetHealthPercent() < 30 && ai->IsInCombat();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called during AI update cycles to determine trigger
    activation. It should be lightweight and not perform heavy computations as it
    may be called frequently. The method relies on the BotAI parameter for context
    evaluation, so passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value means immediate action should be
    taken - the calling code must handle the trigger activation logic separately.
    Avoid performing expensive operations within this method as it may impact AI performance.
