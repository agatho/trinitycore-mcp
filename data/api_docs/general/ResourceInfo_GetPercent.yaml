  method: GetPercent
  signature: float ResourceInfo::GetPercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the percentage value of a resource relative to its
    maximum.
  description: The GetPercent method computes the current resource value as a percentage
    of the maximum possible value for that resource. This is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft UI elements to display health, mana, rage, energy, or other resource
    bars. The returned float value typically ranges from 0.0f (0%) to 1.0f (100%),
    though it may exceed 1.0f in certain edge cases such as overhealing or overcharging
    effects. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe for repeated
    calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the resource percentage, where 0.0f indicates
    0% and 1.0f indicates 100%. Values may exceed 1.0f in special circumstances like
    overhealing or temporary resource boosts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Health Percentage
    code: "float healthPercent = player->GetResourceInfo()->GetPercent();\nif (healthPercent\
      \ <= 0.2f) {\n    // Player is at critical health\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Percentage in UI Updates
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n    float resourcePercent = target->GetResourceInfo()->GetPercent();\n\
      \    // Update UI bar to show resource level\n    uiBar->SetProgress(resourcePercent);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ResourceInfo object has valid current and maximum
    resource values. It performs no validation on these values, so calling it with
    uninitialized or invalid data may produce unexpected results. The calculation
    is typically performed as (current_value / max_value), which means division by
    zero should be avoided in upstream code.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned value for conditional logic without
    checking for edge cases such as negative resource values or maximums of zero.
    Also note that some resources may have special mechanics (like rage regeneration)
    that could affect the percentage calculation dynamically.
