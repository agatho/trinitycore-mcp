  class: DeathRecoveryManager
  method: DecideResurrectionMethod
  signature: void DeathRecoveryManager::DecideResurrectionMethod()
documentation:
  brief: Determines the appropriate resurrection method for a player based on their
    current death circumstances and game state.
  description: The DecideResurrectionMethod function evaluates various conditions
    to select the most suitable resurrection option for a player who has died. It
    considers factors such as whether the player is in a battleground, instance, or
    normal world, their available resurrection options (such as spirit of redemption,
    nearby resurrecters, or corpse retrieval), and any active game mechanics like
    PvP timers or faction-specific rules. This method is typically invoked during
    the death processing sequence to prepare for the appropriate resurrection action.
    The function does not directly perform the resurrection but rather determines
    how it should be handled.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Death Handling
    code: "void Player::HandleDeath()\n{\n    // ... other death logic ...\n    sDeathRecovery->DecideResurrectionMethod();\n\
      \    // ... continue with resurrection preparation ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal death recovery system and should not
    be called directly by external code unless implementing custom death handling
    logic. It interacts with the player's current zone, faction, and game state to
    make decisions.
  warnings: Do not call this function outside of the standard death processing flow
    as it may lead to inconsistent resurrection states or unexpected behavior in battlegrounds
    or instances.
