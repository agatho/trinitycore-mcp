  brief: Processes prospecting mechanics for mining ores and herbs to extract materials.
  description: The EffectProspecting method handles the prospecting mechanic in World
    of Warcraft, where players use a special tool to extract materials from ores and
    herbs. This method is typically invoked when a player successfully prospect an
    ore or herb using a prospecting skill, which allows them to obtain items like
    gems, metal ingots, or other materials based on their skill level and the quality
    of the ore. The method processes the outcome of the prospecting action, determining
    what items are dropped and how many are generated.

  - title: Basic prospecting usage
    code: "void Spell::EffectProspecting()\n{\n    // Implementation details\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell effect system and requires proper handling
    of player skill progression. It should be called only when a player has successfully
    prospect an item, typically after checking skill requirements and random chance.
  warnings: Improper implementation can lead to incorrect item drops or missing rewards.
    Ensure that the method correctly handles the prospecting result and does not allow
    players to prospect without proper skill checks.
