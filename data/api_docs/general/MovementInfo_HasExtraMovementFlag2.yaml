  class: MovementInfo
  method: HasExtraMovementFlag2
  signature: bool MovementInfo::HasExtraMovementFlag2(uint32 flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific extra movement flag is set within the MovementInfo object.
  description: The HasExtraMovementFlag2 method determines whether a particular movement
    flag is active in the MovementInfo instance. This method is used to evaluate flags
    that control advanced movement behaviors such as flying, swimming, or other specialized
    movement states. It performs a bitwise check against the internal movement flags
    storage to return true if the specified flag is present, and false otherwise.
    The method is commonly used during movement processing and validation in the TrinityCore
    server implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified extra movement flag is set; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for a flying movement flag
    code: "if (movementInfo.HasExtraMovementFlag2(MOVEFLAG2_FLYING)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ flying movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional movement validation
    code: "void ProcessPlayerMovement(MovementInfo& movementInfo) {\n    if (movementInfo.HasExtraMovementFlag2(MOVEFLAG2_SWIMMING))\
      \ {\n        // Apply swimming-specific movement adjustments\n    } else if\
      \ (movementInfo.HasExtraMovementFlag2(MOVEFLAG2_FLYING)) {\n        // Apply\
      \ flying-specific movement adjustments\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the internal flag storage of MovementInfo and should
    be used in conjunction with other movement-related methods for comprehensive movement
    state evaluation. The flag values are typically defined as constants within the
    TrinityCore codebase, such as MOVEFLAG2_FLYING or MOVEFLAG2_SWIMMING.
  warnings: Ensure that the flag value passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to known extra movement flags. Using invalid or undefined flag values may lead
    to incorrect behavior or unexpected results during movement processing.
