  signature: RealTimeProfilingStats BotProfiler::GetRealTimeStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves real-time profiling statistics for bot performance monitoring.
  description: The GetRealTimeStats method returns a structured set of profiling data
    that captures current performance metrics for bot operations within the TrinityCore
    environment. This includes information such as CPU usage, memory consumption,
    and execution times for various bot subsystems. The returned data is useful for
    developers and administrators to monitor bot behavior, identify bottlenecks, and
    optimize performance in real-time. The method does not modify any internal state
    and can be called safely during active bot operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A RealTimeProfilingStats object containing current profiling metrics including
    CPU usage, memory usage, and timing data for bot subsystems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      RealTimeProfilingStats stats = profiler.GetRealTimeStats();

      std::cout << "CPU Usage: " << stats.cpuUsage << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of current system load and should be used
    judiciously in performance-critical sections. The returned data is not thread-safe
    and should be copied if accessed from multiple threads.
