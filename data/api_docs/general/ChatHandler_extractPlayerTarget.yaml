    int * player_guid, int * player_name)
documentation:
  brief: Extracts a player target from command arguments and retrieves player information
    including GUID and name.
  description: The extractPlayerTarget method parses command arguments to identify
    and retrieve information about a targeted player in the game. It supports various
    input formats such as player names, GUIDs, or selection targets. The method populates
    output parameters with the resolved player reference, GUID, and name if successful.
    This functionality is commonly used in game master commands where player targeting
    is required for operations like teleportation, banishment, or inspection. The
    method returns true upon successful extraction and population of target data,
    or false if the target cannot be resolved or is invalid.
  parameters:
  - name: args
    description: Character array containing command arguments that specify the player
      target (e.g., player name, GUID, or 'self')
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to a Player pointer that will be set to the resolved player
      object if found
  - name: player_guid
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be populated with the GUID of the
      target player if found
  - name: player_name
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be populated with the name hash of
      the target player if found
  returns: True if a valid player target was successfully extracted and all output
    parameters were populated; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Target Extraction
    code: "char args[] = \"JohnDoe\";\nPlayer* target_player = nullptr;\nint guid\
      \ = 0;\nint name_hash = 0;\nif (handler->extractPlayerTarget(args, &target_player,\
      \ &guid, &name_hash)) {\n    // Successfully extracted player\n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Found player: %s with GUID: %u\", target_player->GetName().c_str(), guid);\n\
      } else {\n    handler->SendSysMessage(\"Player not found.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Extracting Player by GUID
    code: "char args[] = \"12345\";\nPlayer* target_player = nullptr;\nint guid =\
      \ 0;\nint name_hash = 0;\nif (handler->extractPlayerTarget(args, &target_player,\
      \ &guid, &name_hash)) {\n    // Successfully extracted player by GUID\n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Found player with GUID %u: %s\", guid, target_player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      } else {\n    handler->SendSysMessage(\"Invalid GUID or player not found.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in command implementations where player targeting
    is required. It handles multiple input formats including direct name matching,
    GUID lookup, and selection-based targeting. The method internally uses the WorldSession
    to resolve targets and may perform additional validation checks on the target
    player's online status.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided arguments are valid and properly
    formatted. Incorrectly formatted arguments or non-existent players will result
    in a false return value without any error messages. Always check the return value
    before using the output parameters.
