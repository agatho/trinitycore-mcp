  method: MoveInLineOfSight_Safe
  signature: void PetAI::MoveInLineOfSight_Safe(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Safely processes line-of-sight events for a pet AI, preventing potential
    crashes or undefined behavior during movement.
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight_Safe method is a protected utility function within
    the PetAI class designed to handle line-of-sight events in a safe manner. It ensures
    that when a pet's AI detects an object in its line of sight, it properly processes
    this event without causing memory access violations or other undefined behavior.
    This method typically checks for valid pointers and proper state conditions before
    proceeding with any line-of-sight logic. The function is particularly important
    in preventing crashes that could occur if the pet or target objects are destroyed
    during the processing of the line-of-sight event.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer pointer parameter that likely represents a flag or state
      value controlling how the line-of-sight event is processed. The exact meaning
      depends on internal implementation details and may control behavior such as
      whether to update pet positioning, trigger combat states, or perform other AI-related
      actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within PetAI context
    code: "void MyPetAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Example of calling\
      \ MoveInLineOfSight_Safe in a typical AI update loop\n    int flag = 1;\n  \
      \  MoveInLineOfSight_Safe(&flag);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the PetAI system when line-of-sight
    events occur. It's designed to be robust against null pointers and invalid object
    states, making it safer than direct line-of-sight processing methods. The parameter
    may be used to control specific behaviors such as whether to engage combat or
    simply update awareness state.
  warnings: Developers should not call this method directly unless they understand
    the internal state management of PetAI. Incorrect usage of the parameter value
    could lead to unexpected AI behavior or crashes if not properly validated.
