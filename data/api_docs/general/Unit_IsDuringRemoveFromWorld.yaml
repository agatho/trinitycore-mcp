  signature: bool Unit::IsDuringRemoveFromWorld() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently being removed from the world.
  description: This method checks if a unit (such as a player or creature) is in the
    process of being removed from the game world, typically during a teleportation
    or destruction operation. It returns true when the unit is actively being removed
    and false otherwise. The method is commonly used to prevent operations on units
    that are in the middle of removal, ensuring proper synchronization and preventing
    potential crashes or undefined behavior during world updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently being removed from the world, false
    otherwise. This indicates the unit's state during removal process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsDuringRemoveFromWorld()) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other removal-related methods
    to ensure proper synchronization during unit lifecycle management. It may be called
    from multiple threads, so thread safety should be considered when implementing.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method during critical operations that might cause
    race conditions or undefined behavior if the unit is being removed. Also note
    that this method does not guarantee that the unit will remain in the world after
    the current update cycle.
