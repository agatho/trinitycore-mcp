  signature: void GuildBankManager::WithdrawRequestedItems(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and fulfills guild bank item withdrawal requests for a specified
    player.
  description: The WithdrawRequestedItems method handles the logic for processing
    pending guild bank item withdrawal requests for a given player. This method is
    typically invoked when a player attempts to withdraw items from the guild bank,
    and it ensures that the requested items are properly removed from the guild's
    inventory and delivered to the player. The method likely checks for sufficient
    funds or items in the guild bank, validates the player's permissions, and updates
    both the guild's item count and the player's inventory accordingly. It is part
    of the core guild bank management system and may be triggered automatically upon
    a withdrawal request or manually by an administrator.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter identifies which player's withdrawal requests are being
      processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.WithdrawRequestedItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger transactional system for guild banking,
    where multiple operations might be batched or queued. The player parameter should
    point to a valid player GUID stored in the game's database. This method may involve
    database updates and could have performance implications if called frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an existing player
    before calling this method, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. The method assumes proper synchronization mechanisms are
    in place to prevent race conditions during concurrent access to guild bank data.
