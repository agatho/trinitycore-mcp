documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all Legion dungeon data into the DungeonBehavior system
  description: The LoadLegionDungeons method is responsible for loading and initializing
    all dungeon configurations specific to the Legion expansion (World of Warcraft
    version 7.0). This method prepares the internal data structures required for managing
    dungeon encounters, loot tables, and difficulty settings for Legion content. It
    typically runs during server startup or when the dungeon system needs to be refreshed
    with updated Legion content. The method ensures that all Legion dungeons are properly
    registered within the behavior system, making them available for player entry
    and encounter management.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.LoadLegionDungeons();

      // Dungeons are now loaded and ready for player interaction'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. It's
    typically invoked by the core server initialization process. The method may perform
    database queries to fetch dungeon configurations and could have performance implications
    if called repeatedly.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate dungeon entries
    or memory leaks. Ensure it's only executed once during the application lifecycle.
    This method assumes that the database connection is already established and valid.
