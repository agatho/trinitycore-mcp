  class: ArcaneChargeTracker
  method: AddCharge
  signature: void ArcaneChargeTracker::AddCharge(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Adds arcane charges to the tracker, increasing the current charge count by
    the specified amount.
  description: The AddCharge method is used to increment the arcane charge counter
    within an ArcaneChargeTracker instance. This method is typically invoked when
    a player performs actions that generate arcane energy, such as casting arcane
    spells or using abilities that produce arcane charges. The method accepts a uint32
    parameter representing the number of charges to add. It modifies the internal
    state of the tracker by increasing the current charge count. This functionality
    is commonly associated with classes like mages who utilize arcane charges for
    spellcasting mechanics in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The number of arcane charges to add to the tracker. Must be a non-negative
      integer value. Represents the quantity of arcane energy units being added to
      the current charge count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ArcaneChargeTracker tracker;

      tracker.AddCharge(1);

      // Adds one arcane charge to the tracker'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Charges
    code: 'ArcaneChargeTracker tracker;

      tracker.AddCharge(5);

      // Adds five arcane charges to the tracker

      // Useful for abilities that generate multiple charges at once'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the ArcaneChargeTracker.
    It should only be called when appropriate game mechanics are active, such as during
    spell casting or ability usage. The implementation likely includes bounds checking
    to prevent charge overflow, though specific limits are not defined in the signature.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called with negative values, as it's designed
    for adding charges and may not handle negative inputs gracefully. Calling this
    method outside of appropriate game contexts (e.g., during combat initialization)
    could lead to incorrect charge accumulation or game state inconsistencies.
