  brief: Updates player's heartbeat status and performs necessary game mechanics checks
  description: The Heartbeat method is responsible for updating a player's heartbeat
    status, which typically involves checking and updating various game mechanics
    such as player state, combat status, and other time-based operations. This method
    ensures that the player's state remains consistent with the game server's internal
    clock and maintains proper synchronization with the game world. The method usually
    performs checks on player's current health, mana, and other vital stats to ensure
    they are within acceptable ranges for continued gameplay.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->Heartbeat();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game server during each
    heartbeat cycle, usually every 100 milliseconds. It may perform checks on player's
    state and update various game mechanics such as combat status, health regeneration,
    and other time-based updates.
  warnings: The method should not be called directly by external code without proper
    understanding of its implications. Calling it too frequently could lead to performance
    issues or unnecessary load on the server.
