  signature: const int * DB2Manager::GetRequiredCustomizationChoices(uint32 chrCustomizationReqId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the required customization choices for a specified character customization
    requirement ID.
  description: The GetRequiredCustomizationChoices method fetches an array of integer
    values representing the required customization options associated with a given
    character customization requirement identifier. This is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's character creation and customization system to determine which options
    are mandatory for a specific customization set. The returned pointer points to
    an internal static array, so callers must not attempt to free or modify the data.
    The method assumes that the provided chrCustomizationReqId corresponds to a valid
    entry in the DB2 files loaded by the DB2Manager instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointing to an array of integers representing required customization
    choices. The array is null-terminated, and the caller must not modify or free
    the memory. Returns nullptr if no data is found for the given ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Required Customization Choices
    code: "const int* choices = sDB2Manager->GetRequiredCustomizationChoices(12345);\n\
      if (choices != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; choices[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n\
      \        printf(\"Required choice: %d\\n\", choices[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a pointer to an internal data structure, which is cached
    and managed by the DB2Manager. It is safe for concurrent access as long as the
    underlying DB2 files are not being modified during runtime. The returned array
    is null-terminated and should be iterated until a zero value is encountered.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or reallocate the memory pointed to by the return
    value. The method may return nullptr if no data exists for the given ID, so always
    check for null before using the result. This function assumes valid input IDs;
    invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
