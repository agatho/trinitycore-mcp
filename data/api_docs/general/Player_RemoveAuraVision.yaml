documentation:
  brief: Removes aura vision from a player's field bytes.
  description: This method removes aura vision from a player's field bytes, specifically
    targeting the PlayerFieldByte2Flags enum which controls various visual states
    and effects. The function operates on the player's internal byte flags that represent
    different aura-related visual elements in the game world. It is typically used
    during aura removal processes or when transitioning between different visual states
    of a player's character.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveAuraVision(PlayerFieldByte2Flags::PLAYER_FIELD_BYTE2_FLAG_PVP);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include that this method likely modifies internal
    player state flags, and may require synchronization with client-side updates.
    Performance considerations involve potential overhead from multiple calls during
    aura removal sequences.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect visual representation
    of player's character state. Incorrect usage may lead to visual inconsistencies
    or unexpected behavior in game mechanics.
