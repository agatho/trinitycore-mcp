  class: GroupCoordination
  method: GetFormationPosition
  signature: int GroupCoordination::GetFormationPosition(uint32 memberGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the formation position index of a group member by their GUID.
  description: The GetFormationPosition method retrieves the positional index of a
    specified group member within the group's formation layout. This index is used
    to determine where in a formation (such as a circle, line, or custom arrangement)
    a particular player should be positioned. The method takes a member's unique identifier
    (GUID) and returns an integer representing their position in the formation sequence.
    If the member is not found in the current formation or if the formation data is
    invalid, the method may return an error code or default value. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining coordinated group positioning during group activities
    such as raids, dungeons, or player-vs-player encounters where positioning matters.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member whose formation
      position is to be retrieved. This value must correspond to a valid player in
      the current group.
  returns: An integer representing the formation position index of the specified member.
    A negative value or zero may indicate an error, invalid GUID, or that the member
    is not part of the formation. Positive values typically represent valid indices
    starting from 1.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Formation Position for a Group Member
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = 123456;\nint position = groupCoordination->GetFormationPosition(playerGuid);\n\
      if (position > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Player is at formation position %d\\n\",\
      \ position);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Failed to retrieve formation position\
      \ for player.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group has an active formation set and that the
    member GUID corresponds to a valid group member. The returned index is typically
    used in conjunction with other formation-related methods to manage or update group
    positioning.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID is valid and refers to a current group member;
    otherwise, the method may return unexpected results or error codes. This method
    should not be called on groups without an active formation.
