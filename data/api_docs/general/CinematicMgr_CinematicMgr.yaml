  class: CinematicMgr
  method: CinematicMgr
  signature: void CinematicMgr::CinematicMgr(Player * playerref)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a cinematic manager instance for the specified player.
  description: The CinematicMgr constructor initializes a new cinematic manager object
    associated with a specific player. This method sets up internal state and data
    structures required to manage cinematic sequences for the given player, including
    tracking active cinematics, handling cinematic events, and coordinating with the
    player's client to display cinematic content. The manager is responsible for ensuring
    that cinematic sequences are properly synchronized with the player's game state
    and that appropriate cleanup occurs when cinematics complete or are interrupted.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Cinematic Manager Initialization
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get a valid player reference

      CinematicMgr cinematicManager(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a player enters a cinematic state or when a cinematic sequence needs to be
    managed. Developers should not directly instantiate CinematicMgr objects unless
    implementing custom cinematic logic. The manager assumes that the provided player
    reference is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly with an invalid or null player reference,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The CinematicMgr is designed
    to be used in conjunction with the core TrinityCore systems for proper cinematic
    handling.
