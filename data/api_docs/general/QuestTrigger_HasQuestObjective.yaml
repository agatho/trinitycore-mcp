documentation:
  brief: Checks if the quest trigger has a specific quest objective assigned to it.
  description: The HasQuestObjective method determines whether a QuestTrigger object
    contains a valid quest objective. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore
    AI system to evaluate if a bot or NPC should pursue a particular quest based on
    its current objectives. The check involves verifying internal state flags and
    objective assignments associated with the trigger. It's commonly called during
    AI decision-making processes when evaluating quest progression or available actions
    for the character.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the QuestTrigger has an assigned quest objective; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates whether the trigger is currently configured to handle
    a specific quest-related task.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (questTrigger.HasQuestObjective(ai)) {\n    // Proceed with quest-related\
      \ actions\n    ai->GetBot()->GetAI()->DoQuestAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the QuestTrigger class
    and may depend on prior initialization of quest data. It's recommended to ensure
    that quest objectives are properly set before calling this method for reliable
    results.
