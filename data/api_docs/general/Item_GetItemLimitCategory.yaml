documentation:
  brief: Returns the item limit category identifier for the current item.
  description: The GetItemLimitCategory method retrieves the item limit category identifier
    associated with the current item instance. This identifier determines which player
    class or level restrictions apply to the item, and is used by the game engine
    to enforce item limitations such as level requirements, class restrictions, and
    other in-game mechanics. The method is typically used during item processing and
    validation within TrinityCore's item system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the item limit category identifier. This
    value corresponds to the ItemLimitCategory field in the ItemTemplate database
    table, and determines which restrictions apply to the item based on player class
    or level requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item;

      uint32 limitCategory = item->GetItemLimitCategory();

      // limitCategory now contains the item limit category ID'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard Item class interface and should be used
    in conjunction with other item-related methods for complete item validation. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this method simply accesses a stored value.
  warnings: No specific warnings. However, developers should ensure that the item
    instance is valid before calling this method to avoid potential access violations.
