  class: PlayerDataAccessor
  method: PlayerDataAccessor
  signature: void PlayerDataAccessor::PlayerDataAccessor(const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PlayerDataAccessor instance with a given player pointer for
    accessing player-related data.
  description: The PlayerDataAccessor constructor initializes an instance of the PlayerDataAccessor
    class using a const Player pointer. This accessor provides methods to retrieve
    various player data fields and properties without directly exposing the internal
    Player object. The constructor performs necessary setup to ensure safe access
    to player information, including validating the input player pointer and preparing
    internal data structures for subsequent operations. It is typically used in systems
    that need to read or manipulate player data while maintaining encapsulation and
    preventing direct modification of the Player object.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A const pointer to the Player object this accessor will interface
      with. Must not be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Logic
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer

      PlayerDataAccessor accessor(targetPlayer);

      uint32 playerId = accessor.GetPlayerId();

      uint32 level = accessor.GetLevel();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Accessor in Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    PlayerDataAccessor accessor(player);\n\
      \    uint32 accountId = accessor.GetAccountId();\n    std::string playerName\
      \ = accessor.GetName();\n    // Process player data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The PlayerDataAccessor does not take ownership of the Player pointer. The
    referenced Player object must remain valid for the lifetime of this accessor instance.
    This class is designed to provide read-only access to player data, and any attempt
    to modify player state through this interface should be avoided.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the constructor will result in undefined behavior.
    Always validate that the Player pointer is non-null before constructing a PlayerDataAccessor.
    The accessor assumes the Player object remains valid during its lifetime, so do
    not use it after the player has been removed from the world or deleted.
