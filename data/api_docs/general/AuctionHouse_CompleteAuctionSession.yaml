  class: AuctionHouse
  method: CompleteAuctionSession
  signature: void AuctionHouse::CompleteAuctionSession(uint32 sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Completes an auction house session for the specified session ID, processing
    all pending auction activities and updating the auction house state.
  description: The CompleteAuctionSession method finalizes an auction house interaction
    identified by the given session ID. This method typically handles the settlement
    of auctions, updates item ownership, processes bids, and cleans up temporary auction
    data associated with the session. It ensures that all auction-related transactions
    are properly concluded and that the auction house database reflects the current
    state of completed auctions. The method is generally called when a player finishes
    interacting with the auction house interface or when an auction session times
    out. This function may also trigger notifications to players about auction outcomes,
    such as winning or losing bids.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier for the auction house session to be completed.
      This ID corresponds to a specific player's interaction with the auction house
      and is used to locate and process all pending auction activities associated
      with that session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Completing an Auction Session
    code: 'AuctionHouse auctionHouse;

      uint32 sessionId = 12345;

      auctionHouse.CompleteAuctionSession(sessionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the session is fully prepared for
    completion. It is assumed that all bids and transactions related to the session
    have been validated before calling this function. The implementation may involve
    database updates, player notifications, and cleanup of temporary auction data.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent session ID could result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the session ID is valid and corresponds
    to an active auction house interaction before invoking this method.
