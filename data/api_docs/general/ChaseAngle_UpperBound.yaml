  method: UpperBound
  signature: float ChaseAngle::UpperBound() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the upper bound value of the chase angle.
  description: The UpperBound method retrieves the maximum allowable angle value for
    a chase behavior within the TrinityCore AI system. This value defines the extent
    to which an AI-controlled unit can turn while pursuing a target, typically used
    in pathfinding and movement logic to ensure realistic and bounded pursuit mechanics.
    The returned float represents an angular limit in radians, often constrained by
    game-specific parameters such as turn rates or combat behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the upper bound of the chase angle in radians.
    This value defines the maximum angular deviation allowed during pursuit behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use chase angle upper bound
    code: "float maxAngle = unit->GetChaseAngle()->UpperBound();\nif (maxAngle > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Use the upper bound to constrain AI movement\n    float constrainedAngle\
      \ = std::min(currentAngle, maxAngle);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other chase angle calculations
    within the AI subsystem. The returned value may vary depending on the specific
    creature type or AI configuration.
