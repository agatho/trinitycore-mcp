api:
  class: WarriorAI
  method: RecordAbilityUsage
  signature: void WarriorAI::RecordAbilityUsage(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Records the usage of a specified spell ability for the warrior AI.
  description: The RecordAbilityUsage method logs when a specific spell ability is
    used by the warrior AI. This function is typically called during combat to track
    which abilities have been executed, potentially for cooldown management, ability
    rotation optimization, or performance analysis. The method likely updates internal
    tracking structures within the AI system to maintain state about recently used
    abilities. It does not directly execute the spell but serves as a logging mechanism
    for strategic decision-making processes.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell ability being recorded. This value
      corresponds to the Spell ID defined in the game's spell database and must be
      a valid spell entry that can be used by the warrior class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyWarriorAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Record usage of Heroic Strike\
      \ when combat begins\n    RecordAbilityUsage(78);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "void MyWarriorAI::ExecuteNextAbility()\n{\n    if (me->HasSpellCooldown(1680))\n\
      \    {\n        // Only record usage if the spell is available\n        RecordAbilityUsage(1680);\
      \ // Execute Slam\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever an ability is executed by the warrior
    AI to ensure accurate tracking. It's important to note that this function only
    records usage and does not perform any spell casting or cooldown calculations
    itself.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to a valid warrior spell;
    invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or silent failures in the AI logic.
