  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: HandleTrashMobs
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleTrashMobs(Group * group, const int & trashMobIds)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and manages trash mob behavior for a group within a dungeon environment.
  description: The HandleTrashMobs method is responsible for managing the behavior
    of non-boss enemy mobs (trash mobs) that appear during dungeon encounters. This
    method typically handles the spawning, positioning, and AI logic for these mobs
    in relation to the player group. It ensures that trash mobs are properly integrated
    into the dungeon's encounter flow, including their respawning mechanics, aggro
    distribution, and interaction with the group's combat dynamics. The method may
    also handle cleanup of previously spawned trash mobs before spawning new ones
    to maintain proper encounter balance.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group currently
      in the dungeon. This parameter determines which players will be affected by
      the trash mob behavior and how aggro is distributed.
  - name: trashMobIds
    description: Reference to an integer containing the identifier(s) for the trash
      mobs to be processed. This value likely corresponds to a database entry or template
      ID that defines which specific mob types should be spawned or managed during
      this encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trash Mob Handling
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnPlayerEnterDungeon(Group* group)\n{\n    int trashMobId\
      \ = 12345;\n    dungeonBehavior.HandleTrashMobs(group, trashMobId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Trash Mob Management with Multiple Mob Types
    code: "void DungeonEncounter::SpawnTrashMobs(Group* group)\n{\n    std::vector<int>\
      \ mobIds = {12345, 12346, 12347};\n    for (int id : mobIds)\n    {\n      \
      \  dungeonBehavior.HandleTrashMobs(group, id);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during dungeon encounter initialization or
    when a new phase of the encounter begins. It's important to ensure that the group
    parameter is valid and that the trashMobIds correspond to existing mob templates
    in the database. The method may perform cleanup operations on previous trash mobs
    before spawning new ones.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group pointer or non-existent mob
    ID can result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate parameters before
    calling this method, especially in dynamic dungeon environments where groups may
    change or mobs might be destroyed.
