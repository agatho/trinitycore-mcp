  class: CharmInfo
  method: SetIsFollowing
  signature: void CharmInfo::SetIsFollowing(bool val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the following state of a charm.
  description: The SetIsFollowing method updates the internal state flag that indicates
    whether a creature controlled by a charm is currently following its master. This
    method is typically used in the context of pet behavior management within the
    TrinityCore framework, particularly when handling summoned creatures or pets that
    are under the control of a player. The change in this flag can affect various
    game mechanics such as AI behavior, movement patterns, and interaction with the
    player's commands.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: Boolean value indicating the desired following state. True sets the
      charm to following mode, false sets it to not following mode.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a charm to follow its master
    code: 'CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();

      charmInfo->SetIsFollowing(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stopping a charm from following its master
    code: "if (player->GetCharmInfo()) {\n    player->GetCharmInfo()->SetIsFollowing(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies an internal state flag and does not trigger
    any additional game events or updates. It is expected to be called in conjunction
    with other methods that manage the charm's behavior, such as movement commands
    or AI state changes.
  warnings: Directly calling this method without considering the broader context of
    pet management may lead to inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper synchronization
    with the creature's AI and movement systems.
