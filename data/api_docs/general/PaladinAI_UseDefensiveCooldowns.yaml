  brief: Uses defensive cooldowns for the paladin AI during combat.
  description: The UseDefensiveCooldowns method evaluates and applies appropriate
    defensive abilities and cooldowns for a Paladin AI character in combat. This method
    typically checks the current health status, threat level, and available cooldowns
    to determine which defensive spells or abilities should be used. It is part of
    the general AI behavior for paladin classes within the TrinityCore framework,
    ensuring that the AI makes intelligent use of its defensive capabilities during
    encounters. The method does not require any input parameters and performs its
    actions directly on the AI's current target and state.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI's update loop to ensure timely
    application of defensive cooldowns. It may interact with internal state tracking
    for cooldowns and health thresholds.
