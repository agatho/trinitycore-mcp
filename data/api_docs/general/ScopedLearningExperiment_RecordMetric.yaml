  class: ScopedLearningExperiment
  method: RecordMetric
  signature: void ScopedLearningExperiment::RecordMetric(const std::string & name,
    float value)
documentation:
  brief: Records a metric value with the specified name for the current learning experiment
    scope.
  description: The RecordMetric method stores a floating-point metric value under
    a given name within the context of the current scoped learning experiment. This
    method is typically used to log performance data, behavior measurements, or other
    quantitative observations during gameplay or simulation runs. The recorded metrics
    are associated with the specific instance of ScopedLearningExperiment and may
    be used for analysis, reporting, or machine learning training purposes. The method
    does not return any value and operates synchronously within the current thread
    context.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A string identifier for the metric being recorded. This name should
      be unique within the scope of the experiment to avoid confusion or overwriting
      of data.
  - name: value
    description: The floating-point numerical value of the metric to be stored. This
      can represent any measurable quantity relevant to the experiment, such as player
      reaction time, spell effectiveness, or resource consumption.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Metric Recording
    code: 'ScopedLearningExperiment experiment;

      experiment.RecordMetric("player_reaction_time", 0.45f);

      experiment.RecordMetric("spell_damage_output", 1200.75f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Metrics in a Loop
    code: "ScopedLearningExperiment experiment;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n\
      \    float damage = CalculateDamage(i);\n    experiment.RecordMetric(\"damage_per_iteration\"\
      , damage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and efficient for frequent calls
    during gameplay. It's recommended that metric names are consistent across runs
    to enable meaningful comparisons. The internal storage mechanism may vary depending
    on the implementation of ScopedLearningExperiment, but it should support concurrent
    access if multiple threads are involved.
  warnings: Ensure that the metric names provided are valid identifiers and do not
    contain special characters that could cause issues in data processing pipelines.
    Avoid recording extremely large numbers or NaN values which might skew statistical
    analysis.
