  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: SetQuestStrategy
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::SetQuestStrategy(uint32 botGuid, QuestStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the quest strategy for a specific bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The SetQuestStrategy method configures the behavior or approach that
    a bot should follow when handling quests. This is typically used in dynamic quest
    systems where bots need to adapt their questing behavior based on various factors
    such as player level, available quests, or game state. The method takes a bot's
    unique identifier (GUID) and assigns it a specific quest strategy that defines
    how the bot will interact with quests. This allows for flexible and adaptive questing
    behaviors within the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to set the quest
      strategy. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity in the system.
  - name: strategy
    description: The quest strategy to assign to the bot. This parameter defines how
      the bot should approach questing, including behavior patterns and decision-making
      logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Basic Quest Strategy for a Bot
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem* dqs = sDynamicQuestSystem;

      dqs->SetQuestStrategy(12345, QuestStrategy::EXPLORE);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Multiple Bots with Different Strategies
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem* dqs = sDynamicQuestSystem;

      uint32 bot1Guid = 1001;

      uint32 bot2Guid = 1002;


      // Set one bot to focus on quest completion

      sDynamicQuestSystem->SetQuestStrategy(bot1Guid, QuestStrategy::COMPLETE);


      // Set another bot to explore areas for new quests

      sDynamicQuestSystem->SetQuestStrategy(bot2Guid, QuestStrategy::EXPLORE);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a dynamic questing system that allows bots to adapt
    their behavior in real-time. The actual implementation details of how strategies
    are applied may vary depending on the specific bot AI framework used within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot GUID provided corresponds to an existing bot entity,
    otherwise the method may have undefined behavior or fail silently. Be cautious
    when changing strategies during active questing sessions as it might affect ongoing
    quest states.
