documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market data to identify potential arbitrage opportunities between
    different vendors or zones
  description: The FindArbitrageOpportunities method scans the economy system to detect
    price discrepancies that could allow players to buy low in one location and sell
    high in another, generating profit from the price difference. This method typically
    evaluates item prices across multiple vendors, zones, or auction houses to find
    profitable trade routes. It may consider factors such as item availability, market
    demand, transportation costs, and vendor reputation when determining potential
    arbitrage opportunities. The method is designed to be called periodically or in
    response to economy changes to keep track of profitable trading scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the number of arbitrage opportunities found during the analysis.
    A return value of zero indicates no profitable arbitrage opportunities were detected,
    while a positive integer represents the count of viable opportunities that could
    be exploited by players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int opportunities = economyManager.FindArbitrageOpportunities();\nif (opportunities\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Found %d arbitrage opportunities\\n\", opportunities);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs expensive computations involving market data
    analysis and should not be called too frequently to avoid performance impact.
    The results may vary based on current market conditions, item availability, and
    economy system updates. Implementation may cache previous results or use optimization
    techniques to improve performance.
  warnings: The method may return outdated information if called between economy updates.
    It's recommended to call this method after economy data has stabilized or when
    significant market changes have occurred. Results should be validated before executing
    any trading actions in the game world.
