  class: QuestCompletion
  method: SynchronizeObjectiveStates
  signature: void QuestCompletion::SynchronizeObjectiveStates(Group * group, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes quest objective states for all members of a group.
  description: The SynchronizeObjectiveStates method ensures that all players within
    a specified group have their quest objective progress updated to match the current
    state of the quest. This is typically used when a quest is completed or modified
    in a way that affects all group members, such as when a shared objective is fulfilled.
    The method iterates through each player in the group and updates their individual
    quest progress accordingly. It's commonly called during group-based quest completion
    events or when a quest is triggered by group actions.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose quest states
      need synchronization. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest whose objectives should be synchronized
      across all group members. Must correspond to a valid quest in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for synchronizing group quest progress
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    QuestCompletion::SynchronizeObjectiveStates(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Synchronizing quest progress after group completion of a shared objective
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && group->GetMembersCount() > 1)\n  \
      \  {\n        QuestCompletion::SynchronizeObjectiveStates(group, questId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest data is already properly initialized and
    that all players in the group have the quest active. It does not validate whether
    the quest is actually complete or if objectives are properly updated; it simply
    synchronizes existing progress. The method may be called multiple times without
    side effects, but performance could degrade with large groups.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the questId corresponds to an actual quest in the database
    or unexpected results may occur. This method should not be used during quest creation
    or initialization phases when quest data might not yet be fully loaded.
