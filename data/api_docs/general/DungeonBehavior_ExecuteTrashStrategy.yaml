  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: ExecuteTrashStrategy
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::ExecuteTrashStrategy(Group * group, const int &
    trashMobs)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the trash mob strategy for a dungeon group, managing combat behavior
    against non-boss enemies.
  description: The ExecuteTrashStrategy method controls how a dungeon group handles
    encounters with trash mobs during dungeon progression. This method is typically
    invoked by the DungeonBehavior class to manage the tactical approach when engaging
    multiple smaller enemies before or between boss fights. It coordinates group positioning,
    targeting priorities, and combat mechanics to ensure efficient clearing of trash
    mobs while maintaining optimal group dynamics. The method likely takes into account
    the number of trash mobs present and applies appropriate AI behaviors to handle
    them effectively.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the dungeon party. This
      parameter defines which players are involved in the trash mob encounter and
      their current status.
  - name: trashMobs
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the number of trash mobs currently
      present in the encounter. This value determines how the strategy is executed
      and may influence targeting priority or group positioning.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trash Strategy Execution
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::OnTrashEncounter(Group* group, int trashCount)\n{\n \
      \   ExecuteTrashStrategy(group, trashCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Trash Strategy Based on Mob Count
    code: "void DungeonBehavior::ExecuteTrashStrategy(Group* group, const int& trashMobs)\n\
      {\n    if (trashMobs > 5)\n        // Execute aggressive strategy for large\
      \ groups\n        ExecuteAggressiveStrategy(group);\n    else\n        // Execute\
      \ standard strategy for smaller groups\n        ExecuteStandardStrategy(group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the dungeon AI framework and should be called during
    active combat encounters with trash mobs. The implementation likely involves group
    coordination, threat management, and targeting logic to ensure optimal performance
    during dungeon progression.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group parameter is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Improper handling of the trashMobs count could lead to incorrect AI behavior
    or group inefficiency.
