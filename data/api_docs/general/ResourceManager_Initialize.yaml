documentation:
  brief: Initializes the resource manager's internal data structures and loads required
    resource files.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the ResourceManager class by preparing
    its internal state for managing game resources such as textures, models, sounds,
    and other assets. This method typically handles loading configuration files, initializing
    caches, and establishing necessary system connections or file handles. It ensures
    that all resources are properly registered and accessible for use during gameplay.
    The method should be called once during server startup before any resource requests
    are made. No parameters are required as the initialization process uses default
    settings or values loaded from configuration files.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'ResourceManager* resourceManager = new ResourceManager();

      resourceManager->Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization and should not
    be invoked multiple times. It may block execution while loading resources, so
    it's recommended to call it early in the startup sequence. The ResourceManager
    must be properly constructed before calling Initialize.
  warnings: Calling Initialize on an already initialized ResourceManager may lead
    to undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure this method is only called once
    per instance. Avoid calling it from within time-sensitive code paths as it might
    cause performance hiccups during loading phases.
