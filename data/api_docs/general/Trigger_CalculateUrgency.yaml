  signature: float Trigger::CalculateUrgency(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the urgency level of a trigger for bot AI decision
    making.
  description: The CalculateUrgency method evaluates the importance or immediacy of
    a trigger within the context of an AI bot's decision-making process. It takes
    into account various factors such as proximity, threat level, and relevance to
    the current bot state. This value is used by the AI system to prioritize which
    triggers should be addressed first when multiple events occur simultaneously.
    The method is typically called during AI update cycles to dynamically assess trigger
    priority.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the urgency level of the trigger, where higher
    values indicate more urgent triggers that require immediate attention from the
    AI. Values are typically between 0.0 (least urgent) and 1.0 (most urgent), though
    implementations may vary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "float urgency = trigger->CalculateUrgency(ai);\nif (urgency > 0.7f)\n{\n\
      \    // Handle high-priority trigger immediately\n    ai->HandleTrigger(trigger);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Multiple Triggers
    code: "Trigger* bestTrigger = nullptr;\nfloat highestUrgency = 0.0f;\n\nfor (auto&\
      \ trigger : ai->GetTriggers())\n{\n    float urgency = trigger->CalculateUrgency(ai);\n\
      \    if (urgency > highestUrgency)\n    {\n        highestUrgency = urgency;\n\
      \        bestTrigger = trigger;\n    }\n}\n\nif (bestTrigger && highestUrgency\
      \ > 0.5f)\n{\n    ai->ProcessTrigger(bestTrigger);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently during AI processing, so
    performance optimization is important. The implementation should avoid heavy computations
    or database lookups that could slow down the AI decision cycle. The urgency calculation
    may vary based on bot class, current combat state, or other contextual factors.
  warnings: The return value may not always be within the expected 0.0-1.0 range and
    should be validated before use in critical decision paths. Ensure that this method
    is not called during sensitive operations where thread safety might be a concern.
