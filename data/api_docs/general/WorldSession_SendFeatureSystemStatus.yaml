  brief: Sends the feature system status message to the client
  description: The SendFeatureSystemStatus method transmits a packet to the connected
    client containing information about the current state of various game features
    and systems. This includes data such as enabled/disabled features, version information,
    and system capabilities that the client should be aware of. The method is typically
    invoked during session initialization or when feature states change dynamically
    during gameplay. It ensures that the client's UI and gameplay logic are synchronized
    with the server's current feature configuration.
