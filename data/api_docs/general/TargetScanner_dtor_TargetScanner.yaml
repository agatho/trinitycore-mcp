documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TargetScanner instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The TargetScanner destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of a TargetScanner object. This includes
    releasing any internal data structures, clearing cached target information, and
    ensuring no dangling pointers remain. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system,
    this method ensures proper cleanup when a target scanning operation is completed
    or when the scanner object is explicitly destroyed. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, making it
    essential for preventing memory leaks in AI-based targeting systems.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    TargetScanner scanner;\n    // ... use scanner\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor automatically called here when scanner goes out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion Example
    code: 'TargetScanner* scanner = new TargetScanner();

      // ... use scanner ...

      delete scanner; // Triggers destructor

      scanner = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern used throughout TrinityCore. It ensures that all resources are properly
    released even if exceptions occur during target scanning operations. Developers
    should not manually invoke this destructor unless explicitly managing memory through
    raw pointers.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly on stack-allocated objects as it
    will be invoked automatically. Avoid manual deletion of objects managed by smart
    pointers or containers, as this can lead to double-free errors and undefined behavior.
