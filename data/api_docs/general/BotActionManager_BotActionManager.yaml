  brief: Initializes a new BotActionManager instance as a copy of an existing instance
  description: The BotActionManager constructor creates a new instance by copying
    the state and configuration from an existing BotActionManager object. This copy
    constructor ensures that all internal data structures, action mappings, and bot
    behavior settings are duplicated to maintain consistent bot functionality across
    multiple instances. The method is typically used when creating new bot instances
    that should inherit the same action management behavior as an existing bot manager.
    This implementation follows standard C++ copy semantics where member variables
    are shallow-copied unless explicitly handled otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Copy of BotActionManager
    code: 'BotActionManager originalManager;

      // Configure originalManager with actions...

      BotActionManager newManager(originalManager); // Copy constructor usage

      // newManager now has identical configuration to originalManager'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a copy constructor, not a regular method. It's automatically called
    when creating a new BotActionManager object from an existing one. The implementation
    assumes that all member variables can be copied using default copy semantics unless
    they require special handling.
