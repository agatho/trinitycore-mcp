  class: GameObjectAI
  method: JustSummoned
  signature: void GameObjectAI::JustSummoned(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature is summoned by this game object AI.
  description: The JustSummoned method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework whenever
    a Creature is successfully summoned through this GameObject's AI behavior. This
    callback allows the AI to perform specific actions or logic immediately after
    a creature has been summoned, such as initializing the summoned creature's state,
    setting up combat behavior, or triggering additional events. The method is part
    of the GameObjectAI class and is typically overridden in custom AI implementations
    to provide specialized summoning behavior. It is important to note that this method
    is only called for creatures summoned via this specific game object's AI system,
    not for all summoned creatures in general.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that was summoned by this game object
      AI. This parameter represents the summoned creature and can be used to access
      its properties, methods, or perform actions on it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustSummoned(Creature*\
      \ summoned) override\n    {\n        // Example: Set the summoned creature to\
      \ attack the nearest player\n        if (summoned)\n        {\n            summoned->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \            summoned->AI()->AttackStart(Unit::GetClosestPlayer(summoned, 50.0f));\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Summon Tracking
    code: "class BossGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI\n{\nprivate:\n    std::vector<Creature*>\
      \ m_summonedCreatures;\npublic:\n    void JustSummoned(Creature* summoned) override\n\
      \    {\n        if (summoned)\n        {\n            // Store reference to\
      \ summoned creature for later management\n            m_summonedCreatures.push_back(summoned);\n\
      \            \n            // Set custom AI behavior\n            summoned->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS,\
      \ UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n            summoned->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n\
      \            \n            // Trigger event or send message to nearby players\n\
      \            if (summoned->GetMap())\n            {\n                summoned->GetMap()->SendZoneUnderAttackMessage(summoned->GetZoneId(),\
      \ 0, \"A minion has been summoned!\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called during the game object's AI update cycle and should
    not perform heavy operations that could block the main thread. The summoned creature
    parameter is guaranteed to be valid at the time of this call, but it may not yet
    have fully initialized its AI or combat state. Developers should ensure any necessary
    initialization or setup logic for the summoned creature is handled appropriately
    within this method.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying or destroying the summoned creature within
    this callback as it might lead to undefined behavior if other systems are still
    referencing it. Also, avoid calling methods that may recursively trigger AI callbacks
    from within JustSummoned, which could cause stack overflow issues.
