documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads item-based actions for bot AI behavior.
  description: The LoadItemActions method in BotAIInitializer is responsible for setting
    up and configuring item-related actions that bots will use during their AI decision-making
    process. This method typically reads configuration data or initializes internal
    structures that define how bots should interact with items in the game world,
    such as looting, equipping, or using consumable items. It is part of the broader
    AI initialization sequence and ensures that bot behavior includes appropriate
    item handling mechanics based on predefined rules or configurations.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Initialization
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.LoadItemActions();

      // Bot AI is now configured with item actions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the initialization phase of
    a bot's AI system, before the bot begins making decisions. It may involve reading
    from configuration files or databases to determine what item actions are available
    and how they should be prioritized.
