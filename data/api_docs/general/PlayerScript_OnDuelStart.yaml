documentation:
  brief: Called when a duel between two players is initiated
  description: The OnDuelStart method is invoked when a duel begins between two players
    in TrinityCore. This callback allows scripts to execute custom logic at the start
    of a duel, such as modifying player states, applying temporary buffs or debuffs,
    or triggering other game events. The method receives references to both players
    involved in the duel and is typically used for implementing duel-related mechanics
    or restrictions. It's important to note that this method is called before the
    actual duel mechanics are initialized, so changes made here can influence how
    the duel proceeds.
  parameters:
  - name: player1
    description: Pointer to the first player who initiated the duel
  - name: player2
    description: Pointer to the second player who accepted the duel
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Duel Start Handler
    code: "class MyDuelScript : public PlayerScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyDuelScript()\
      \ : PlayerScript(\"MyDuelScript\") {}\n\n    void OnDuelStart(Player* player1,\
      \ Player* player2) override\n    {\n        // Log the duel start\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Duel started between %s and %s\", player1->GetName().c_str(), player2->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \        \n        // Apply a temporary buff to both players\n        player1->AddAura(12345,\
      \ player1);\n        player2->AddAura(12345, player2);\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is part of the PlayerScript system which allows custom behavior
    to be injected into core game events. The players passed to this function are
    guaranteed to be valid and in the same map. Be cautious when modifying player
    states or applying effects that might interfere with the duel mechanics themselves.
  warnings: Avoid performing operations that could prevent the duel from starting
    properly, such as teleporting players away or removing them from the duel arena.
    Modifying player stats or abilities during this callback may affect the fairness
    of the duel.
