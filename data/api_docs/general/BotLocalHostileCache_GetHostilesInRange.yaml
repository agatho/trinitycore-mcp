  class: BotLocalHostileCache
  method: GetHostilesInRange
  signature: int BotLocalHostileCache::GetHostilesInRange(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of hostile units within the specified range.
  description: The GetHostilesInRange method retrieves the number of hostile units
    (such as enemies or aggro targets) that are currently within the defined range
    of the bot. This method is typically used in AI decision-making processes to determine
    threat levels and prioritize actions. The method does not return specific unit
    information, but rather provides a count for quick assessment. It's commonly used
    in combat logic to evaluate whether the bot should engage, flee, or seek assistance
    based on the number of nearby enemies.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of hostile units found within
    the specified range. Returns 0 if no hostiles are detected within range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int hostileCount = bot->GetHostilesInRange(10.0f);\nif (hostileCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Bot has enemies nearby\n    bot->SetTarget(bot->GetHostileList().front());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Decision Making
    code: "float range = 25.0f;\nint hostiles = bot->GetHostilesInRange(range);\n\
      if (hostiles >= 3)\n{\n    // Too many enemies, consider fleeing\n    bot->DoFlee();\n\
      }\nelse if (hostiles == 0)\n{\n    // No enemies, resume normal behavior\n \
      \   bot->DoIdle();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal caching mechanisms to avoid frequent expensive
    calculations. The range parameter is typically measured in yards or game units.
    Performance may be impacted if the cache needs to be rebuilt frequently due to
    many moving targets.
  warnings: The method assumes that hostile units are properly tracked by the bot's
    AI system. If the bot's target tracking is disabled or corrupted, this method
    may return inaccurate counts. Also, the method may not account for line-of-sight
    restrictions in some implementations.
