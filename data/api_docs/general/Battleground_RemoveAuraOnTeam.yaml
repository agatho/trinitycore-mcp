  class: Battleground
  method: RemoveAuraOnTeam
  signature: void Battleground::RemoveAuraOnTeam(int SpellID, int team)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified aura from all players on the given team within the battleground.
  description: The RemoveAuraOnTeam method removes a spell aura with the specified
    SpellID from all players belonging to the given team in the battleground. This
    method is typically used during battleground events or when specific game mechanics
    require the removal of buffs, debuffs, or other spell effects from one or both
    teams. The team parameter usually corresponds to either the Alliance (0) or Horde
    (1) team identifiers. This function ensures that all affected players have the
    specified aura removed, which may include updating their unit state, removing
    visual effects, and cleaning up any associated auras or modifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: SpellID
    description: The unique identifier of the spell aura to be removed from players
      on the team. This must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell
      database.
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier from which to remove the aura. Typically 0 for
      Alliance and 1 for Horde, though other values may be used depending on implementation
      details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a debuff from all Horde players
    code: battleground->RemoveAuraOnTeam(12345, 1); // Removes spell ID 12345 from
      all Horde players
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear all auras from Alliance team after flag capture
    code: battleground->RemoveAuraOnTeam(98765, 0); // Removes spell ID 98765 from
      all Alliance players
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through all players on the specified team and
    calls internal aura removal functions for each player. It may be used in conjunction
    with other battleground state management methods to ensure consistent gameplay
    mechanics during events like flag captures, teleportations, or spell cooldown
    resets.
  warnings: Ensure that the SpellID provided is valid and corresponds to an actual
    aura that players might possess; otherwise, the method may silently fail or cause
    unexpected behavior. Be cautious when calling this method during active battleground
    phases where player states are rapidly changing.
