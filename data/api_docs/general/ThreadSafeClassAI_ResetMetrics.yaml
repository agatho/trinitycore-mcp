  brief: Resets all performance and activity metrics tracked by the ThreadSafeClassAI
    instance.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated performance data, counters,
    and tracking information within the ThreadSafeClassAI class. This function is
    typically used to reset internal statistics after a specific monitoring period
    or to prepare for new metric collection cycles. The method ensures thread-safe
    operation by utilizing appropriate synchronization mechanisms, making it safe
    to call from multiple threads concurrently. It does not affect the AI's operational
    state or behavior, only its recorded metrics.
