  brief: Attempts to cast Crash Lightning spell on target enemy unit
  description: The HandleCrashLightning method represents a core combat behavior for
    Shaman AI units, specifically targeting the execution of the Crash Lightning spell.
    This method evaluates whether the current target is valid and within casting range
    before attempting to initiate the spell. It typically serves as part of the AI's
    offensive capability, particularly in scenarios where the shaman needs to apply
    damage or debuff effects to enemies. The method returns true if the spell was
    successfully initiated or queued for casting, and false otherwise. This function
    is commonly invoked during combat decision-making processes within the ShamanAI
    class.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Crash Lightning spell was successfully initiated or queued
    for casting on a valid target; returns false if conditions prevent successful
    casting such as invalid target, insufficient mana, or out-of-range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat loop
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandleCrashLightning()) {\n    // Spell was initiated successfully\n\
      \    // Additional logic for spell tracking or cooldown management\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI decision tree and may be called
    in conjunction with other spell handling methods. The actual casting mechanics
    depend on the underlying TrinityCore spell system and target validation. Performance
    considerations are minimal unless used in high-frequency combat loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is valid and accessible before calling this
    method, as invalid targets can cause unexpected behavior or crashes. This method
    should not be called directly without proper AI state management.
