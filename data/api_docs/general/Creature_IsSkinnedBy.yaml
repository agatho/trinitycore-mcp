documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player has skinned the creature.
  description: The IsSkinnedBy method checks if a specific player has successfully
    skinned the creature, meaning they have removed all hide from the creature's skin.
    This method is typically used in the context of loot mechanics and skinning operations
    within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. It returns true when the player
    has completed the skinning process, and false otherwise. The method requires that
    the player be present in the world and have a valid skinning skill to properly
    function.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has skinned the creature, false otherwise. This
    indicates that the player has successfully completed the skinning process and
    removed all hide from the creature's skin.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->IsSkinnedBy(player)) {\n    // Player has skinned the creature\n\
      \    // Proceed with loot logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skinning-related
    methods and should be called only when the player is present in the world. The
    method may not function properly if the player's skinning skill is not active
    or if the creature has no skinning loot.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player has completed
    skinning, as it requires that the player be present and have valid skinning skills.
    If the player is not in the world or does not have proper skinning skills, this
    method may return false even if the player has skinned the creature.
