api:
  class: SpellMgr
  method: LoadSpellLearnSpells
  signature: void SpellMgr::LoadSpellLearnSpells()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes spell learning data from database entries for all spells
    in the spell manager.
  description: The LoadSpellLearnSpells method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures of the SpellMgr class with spell learning information retrieved
    from the database. This includes parsing records that define which spells are
    learned by players or NPCs at specific levels, through trainers, or via item usage.
    The method typically runs during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure all spell learning mechanics are correctly configured in memory. It
    processes the spell_learn_spells table data and builds lookup tables for fast
    access during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellManager()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellLearnSpells();\n\
      \    // Spell learning data is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or database
    reloads. It modifies internal spell manager state and is not thread-safe when
    called concurrently with other methods that access the same data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure no active gameplay sessions are using
    spell learning mechanics while reloading.
