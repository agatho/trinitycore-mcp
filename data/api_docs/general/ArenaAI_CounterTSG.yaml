  class: ArenaAI
  method: CounterTSG
  signature: void ArenaAI::CounterTSG(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a targeted spell guard counterattack against a specified player
    in arena combat.
  description: The CounterTSG method implements a specialized defensive mechanism
    for ArenaAI that triggers a counterattack using a targeted spell guard ability
    when a player initiates an attack. This method is typically invoked during arena
    battles to provide strategic retaliation against incoming threats. The method
    takes a pointer to an integer representing the target player and executes appropriate
    combat logic to respond to the threat. It's designed specifically for arena environments
    where precise timing and tactical responses are crucial for victory.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer identifier representing the target player who
      initiated the attack. This parameter specifies which opponent to counterattack
      against in the arena combat scenario.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CounterTSG Usage
    code: "void MyArenaAI::HandlePlayerAttack(int* targetPlayer)\n{\n    // Execute\
      \ counterattack against the attacking player\n    CounterTSG(targetPlayer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: CounterTSG with Validation
    code: "void ArenaAI::ProcessCombat()\n{\n    if (player != nullptr && *player\
      \ >= 0)\n    {\n        CounterTSG(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is specifically designed for use within the TrinityCore arena
    combat system. It assumes that the AI has already identified a valid target and
    that the player reference points to an active opponent in the arena. The implementation
    likely involves spell casting mechanics, cooldown management, and targeting validation
    specific to arena environments.
  warnings: The parameter 'player' must point to a valid integer identifier of an
    active arena opponent; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method should
    only be called during active arena combat scenarios to avoid disrupting normal
    gameplay flow.
