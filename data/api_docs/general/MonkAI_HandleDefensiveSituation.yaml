  class: MonkAI
  method: HandleDefensiveSituation
  signature: void MonkAI::HandleDefensiveSituation()
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the Monk's current defensive state and applies appropriate defensive
    abilities or actions.
  description: The HandleDefensiveSituation method is responsible for assessing the
    Monk AI's current health status, threat level, and surrounding combat conditions
    to determine and execute suitable defensive measures. This includes evaluating
    whether to use defensive cooldowns, applying healing effects, or switching to
    a defensive stance based on the Monk's class mechanics and current battle scenario.
    The method integrates with the broader AI decision-making framework to ensure
    optimal defensive behavior during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    if (me->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30.0f)\n        HandleDefensiveSituation();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle, typically
    when the Monk's health drops below certain thresholds or when specific defensive
    conditions are met. It is designed to work in conjunction with other AI methods
    and should not be invoked independently without proper context.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method outside of combat or without checking
    current state may lead to unnecessary ability usage or incorrect behavior. Ensure
    that the Monk's target and health status are properly evaluated before calling
    this method.
