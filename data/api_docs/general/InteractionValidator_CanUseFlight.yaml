  class: InteractionValidator
  method: CanUseFlight
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CanUseFlight(::Player * bot, uint32 nodeId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can use flight paths at a given node.
  description: The CanUseFlight method evaluates if a specified player is eligible
    to use flight paths from a given interaction node. This validation typically checks
    for prerequisites such as quest completion, faction requirements, and player state.
    The method ensures that players cannot access flight paths they are not authorized
    to use based on game mechanics and progression requirements. It is commonly used
    in AI decision-making processes for bot behavior and player interaction logic.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character attempting
      to use the flight path. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: nodeId
    description: Unique identifier for the flight node or interaction point. Represents
      the specific location from which the player wishes to initiate flight travel.
  returns: Returns true if the player can use the flight path from the specified node,
    false otherwise. The method returns false when prerequisites such as quest completion
    or faction status are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (validator.CanUseFlight(player, 12345)) {\n    // Proceed with flight\
      \ path selection\n    player->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Using flight\
      \ path.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle restricted access\n    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      You cannot use this flight path.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with bot movement system
    code: "class FlightBot {\npublic:\n    bool NavigateToDestination(Player* bot,\
      \ uint32 destinationNode) {\n        if (InteractionValidator::CanUseFlight(bot,\
      \ destinationNode)) {\n            // Initiate flight path\n            return\
      \ bot->GetSession()->SendTravelRequest(destinationNode);\n        }\n      \
      \  return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the player's quest log, faction
    standing, and character level requirements. It may also consider the player's
    current state (e.g., if they are in combat or mounted). The implementation might
    cache results for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. The nodeId should correspond to an actual flight node
    in the game world database; invalid IDs may result in unexpected return values.
