    const
documentation:
  brief: Plays direct music for a player without using the standard music system.
  description: This method allows a WorldObject to directly play a specific music
    ID for a target player, bypassing normal music system behavior. It's typically
    used for custom music events or when direct control over music playback is needed.
    The method operates on the principle that musicId represents a specific sound
    entry in the game's music database, and the target player must be within the object's
    visibility range for the music to play correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: musicId
    description: The unique identifier of the music to play, corresponding to entries
      in the game's music database. Valid values are typically integers from 0 to
      1000000.
  - name: target
    description: The player object for whom the music will be played. Must be a valid
      Player pointer with proper visibility conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      Player* targetPlayer = new Player();

      obj->PlayDirectMusic(12345, targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      Player* targetPlayer = new Player();

      obj->PlayDirectMusic(98765, targetPlayer);

      // This might be used in a quest or event system

      // to trigger specific music for the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: The method likely uses internal game mechanics to
    directly set the music ID for the target player''s client. Performance considerations:
    This method should not be used excessively as it bypasses standard music system
    checks and could cause synchronization issues if used improperly. Thread safety:
    This method is generally safe for single-threaded use but may require synchronization
    in multi-threaded environments.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using invalid musicId values can result in no music
    playing or unexpected behavior. Dangerous edge cases: If the target player is
    not within visibility range, the music may not play correctly or may cause client-side
    errors. Avoid using this method without proper validation of the music ID and
    player.'
