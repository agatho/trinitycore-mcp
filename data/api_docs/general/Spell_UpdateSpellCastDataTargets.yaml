documentation:
  brief: Updates spell cast data targets for a spell instance.
  description: This method updates the spell cast data targets within the Spell class,
    specifically modifying the WorldPackets::Spells::SpellCastData structure to reflect
    the current target information. It handles the synchronization of target data
    for spells being cast, ensuring that the packet sent to clients accurately represents
    the spell's target requirements and constraints. The method is typically invoked
    during spell casting operations to maintain consistency between server-side spell
    state and client-side packet data.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      // Updates the target data for spell cast packet'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell casting mechanism and should not
    be called directly by external code. It's typically invoked during spell execution
    to ensure proper synchronization between server and client target data.
