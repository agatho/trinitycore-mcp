  class: ItemTemplate
  method: GetLockID
  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetLockID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the lock identifier associated with the item template, used for determining
    lock requirements.
  description: The GetLockID method retrieves the lock ID value stored in the ItemTemplate
    structure. This ID corresponds to a specific lock entry in the game's database,
    which defines the conditions required to unlock or interact with the item. In
    World of Warcraft's context, this is commonly used for items that require a key
    or have specific lock mechanics such as chests, doors, or containers. The returned
    value typically maps to an entry in the 'lock' table within the game database,
    where lock properties like required skill, level, or key item are defined. This
    method is essential for implementing proper item interaction logic and ensuring
    that players can only access locked items when meeting the necessary requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the lock ID associated with this item template.
    If the item has no lock requirements, this value will typically be 0. Otherwise,
    it corresponds to an entry in the game's lock database table that defines the
    specific lock properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Lock Requirements
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32\
      \ lockId = itemTemplate->GetLockID();\nif (lockId != 0)\n{\n    // Item has\
      \ a lock, check if player can unlock it\n    LockEntry const* lockEntry = sLockStore.LookupEntry(lockId);\n\
      \    if (lockEntry)\n    {\n        // Process lock requirements\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining if an Item is Lockable
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(player->GetSelectedGO()->GetGOInfo()->id);\n\
      uint32 lockId = itemTemplate->GetLockID();\nif (lockId > 0)\n{\n    // This\
      \ container requires a key or has lock mechanics\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      This container is locked and requires a key.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No lock,\
      \ can be opened directly\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      This container can be opened without a key.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The lock ID returned by this method is directly tied to the 'lock' table
    in the TrinityCore database. Developers should ensure that any lock-related logic
    properly validates against the corresponding LockEntry from the game's data store.
    This method does not perform any validation or checks itself; it simply returns
    the stored value from the item template.
  warnings: Be aware that a returned lock ID of 0 does not necessarily mean the item
    is unlocked - it may indicate no lock entry exists for this item. Always validate
    against the actual LockEntry structure to determine true lock behavior. Also,
    some items might have complex lock requirements involving multiple conditions
    or dynamic locks that cannot be fully determined from just the static lock ID.
