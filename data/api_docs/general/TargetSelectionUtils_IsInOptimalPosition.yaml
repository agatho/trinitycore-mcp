  class: TargetSelectionUtils
  method: IsInOptimalPosition
  signature: bool TargetSelectionUtils::IsInOptimalPosition(Player * bot, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot player is in an optimal positional range relative
    to a target unit for effective combat.
  description: The IsInOptimalPosition method evaluates if a given bot player is positioned
    optimally in relation to a specified target unit. This typically involves checking
    distance, angle, and potential line-of-sight conditions that would allow the bot
    to effectively engage the target. The method is commonly used in AI decision-making
    processes for determining whether a bot should initiate or continue an attack,
    move closer to the target, or reposition. It may consider factors such as the
    bot's weapon range, the target's movement patterns, and environmental obstacles
    that could affect combat effectiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI-controlled bot character
      that is being evaluated for optimal positioning.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target unit against which
      the bot's positioning is being assessed.
  returns: Returns true if the bot is considered to be in an optimal position relative
    to the target, otherwise returns false. This indicates that the bot can effectively
    engage the target based on positional criteria such as distance and line-of-sight.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (TargetSelectionUtils::IsInOptimalPosition(bot, target)) {\n    bot->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_ATTACK, true);\n} else {\n    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat decision making
    code: "bool shouldAttack = TargetSelectionUtils::IsInOptimalPosition(playerBot,\
      \ currentTarget) &&\n                     playerBot->GetDistance(currentTarget)\
      \ <= playerBot->GetAttackDistance();\nif (shouldAttack) {\n    playerBot->Attack(currentTarget,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely incorporates game-specific mechanics such as weapon range
    calculations, target acquisition angles, and possibly terrain considerations.
    It may be used in conjunction with other methods like GetDistance(), IsWithinMeleeRange(),
    or CheckLOS() to make comprehensive positioning decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid null pointer exceptions. The definition of 'optimal position'
    may vary depending on the specific class or specialization of the bot, so results
    should be interpreted accordingly.
