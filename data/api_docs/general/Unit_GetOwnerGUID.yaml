documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the unit's owner
  description: The GetOwnerGUID method retrieves the GUID of the entity that owns
    the current unit. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft client-server communication
    to identify relationships between units and their owners, such as pets, summons,
    or controlled creatures. The method returns an integer representing the GUID,
    which can be used for various operations including checking ownership, tracking
    targets, or managing game objects. In cases where a unit has no owner (such as
    player-controlled units), the method may return zero or a null GUID value.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the unit's owner. If the unit
    has no owner, this value will be zero or null, indicating that no owner exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int ownerGUID = unit->GetOwnerGUID();\nif (ownerGUID != 0)\n{\n    // Unit\
      \ has an owner\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Unit has no owner\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GUID-based methods
    to establish relationships between entities. Performance considerations are minimal,
    as the method simply returns a stored value without complex computations. Thread
    safety depends on how the unit object is accessed, but generally this method does
    not introduce thread safety concerns.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in scenarios where the unit
    may have no owner, such as player-controlled units or non-player controlled creatures.
    The return value of zero does not necessarily indicate an error, but rather a
    lack of ownership.
