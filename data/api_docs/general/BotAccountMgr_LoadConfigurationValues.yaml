  class: BotAccountMgr
  method: LoadConfigurationValues
  signature: void BotAccountMgr::LoadConfigurationValues()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes bot account configuration values from the database
    or configuration files.
  description: The LoadConfigurationValues method is responsible for retrieving and
    setting up all relevant configuration parameters for bot accounts within the TrinityCore
    system. This includes loading settings such as maximum bot limits, spawn rates,
    behavior flags, and other account-specific configurations that govern how bot
    accounts operate in the game world. The method typically executes during server
    startup or when a new bot account is initialized, ensuring that all necessary
    settings are properly configured before any bot-related operations begin. It reads
    from either the database tables storing bot account settings or configuration
    files depending on the implementation strategy.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: 'BotAccountMgr::instance()->LoadConfigurationValues();

      // Called during server startup to initialize bot account settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle,
    typically at server startup. It's important that this method is thread-safe since
    it may be invoked from multiple threads during initialization phases.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    configuration conflicts or memory leaks. Ensure all previous configurations are
    properly reset before calling this method again.
