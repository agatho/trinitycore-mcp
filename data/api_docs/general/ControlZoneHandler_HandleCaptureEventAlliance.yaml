  class: ControlZoneHandler
  method: HandleCaptureEventAlliance
  signature: void ControlZoneHandler::HandleCaptureEventAlliance(GameObject * controlZone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the capture event for an alliance control zone object.
  description: The HandleCaptureEventAlliance method processes the logic when an alliance
    player interacts with or captures a control zone GameObject. This typically occurs
    during world events or battlegrounds where controlling specific zones grants strategic
    advantages. The method likely updates the zone's ownership, triggers related game
    events, and may award rewards or modify faction standings. It is part of the broader
    ControlZoneHandler system that manages contested territorial objectives in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: controlZone
    description: Pointer to the GameObject representing the control zone that is being
      captured by the alliance. Must be a valid GameObject instance of type control
      zone.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterControlZone(Player* player, GameObject* controlZone)\n\
      {\n    if (player->GetTeamId() == TEAM_ALLIANCE)\n    {\n        sControlZoneHandler->HandleCaptureEventAlliance(controlZone);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state tracking for the control zone's
    current owner and may broadcast updates to nearby players. It should only be called
    when a valid alliance player interacts with a control zone GameObject.
  warnings: Ensure that the controlZone parameter is not null and represents an actual
    control zone object before calling this method. Improper usage can lead to undefined
    behavior or game state corruption.
