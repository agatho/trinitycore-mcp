  class: WindwalkerHitComboTracker
  method: RecordSpell
  signature: void WindwalkerHitComboTracker::RecordSpell(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Records a spell cast for Windwalker monk combo tracking purposes.
  description: The RecordSpell method is used to log and track spell casts by a Windwalker
    monk in order to maintain accurate combo point generation and tracking. This method
    updates internal state variables that determine the current combo point count,
    spell sequence validity, and whether certain abilities can be executed based on
    combo point requirements. It typically integrates with the player's combat state
    and spell casting logic within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast. This value must correspond
      to a valid spell in the game's database that is relevant to Windwalker monk
      gameplay, such as martial arts abilities or combo point generating spells.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Recording
    code: 'WindwalkerHitComboTracker tracker;

      tracker.RecordSpell(100780); // Record a Windwalker monk spell

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Spell Casting
    code: "void Player::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    if (GetSpecialization()\
      \ == SPEC_WINDWALKER)\n        m_comboTracker->RecordSpell(spellInfo->Id);\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the caller has already validated that the spell is applicable
    to Windwalker monk gameplay. The internal combo tracking logic may depend on previous
    spell casts, so order of calls matters for accurate state management.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper specialization validation or before
    initializing the combo tracker may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect combo
    point tracking.
