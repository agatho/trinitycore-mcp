  class: NPCEventBus
  method: SubscribeAll
  signature: void NPCEventBus::SubscribeAll(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all NPC events in the event bus.
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a given BotAI subscriber to receive
    notifications for all NPC-related events managed by the NPCEventBus. This allows
    the bot to react to various in-game events such as NPC spawns, deaths, combat
    states, and other relevant occurrences without needing to manually subscribe to
    each individual event type. The method typically integrates the subscriber into
    an internal event routing system where events are dispatched to all registered
    listeners. It is commonly used during bot initialization or when a bot needs to
    monitor all NPC activities within its scope.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: A pointer to the BotAI instance that wishes to subscribe to all NPC
      events. This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid BotAI object
      that has been properly initialized.
  returns: None. The method performs the subscription operation and does not return
    any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Subscription Example
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();

      NPCEventBus::instance()->SubscribeAll(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Subscription in Bot Initialization
    code: "class MyBot : public BotAI {\npublic:\n    void Initialize() override {\n\
      \        NPCEventBus::instance()->SubscribeAll(this);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the NPCEventBus singleton instance has already been
    initialized. The subscriber will receive all events dispatched by the event bus,
    which may impact performance if too many events are being processed. It is recommended
    to unsubscribe when the bot is destroyed or no longer requires event notifications.
  warnings: Calling SubscribeAll with a null pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the BotAI instance is fully constructed before
    calling this method. Also, be cautious about memory leaks if not properly unsubscribing
    from events.
