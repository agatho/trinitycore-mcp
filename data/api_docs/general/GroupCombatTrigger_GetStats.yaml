  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: GetStats
  signature: const CombatStats & GroupCombatTrigger::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the combat statistics for the group combat trigger.
  description: The GetStats method returns a constant reference to the CombatStats
    object associated with the GroupCombatTrigger. This object contains aggregated
    combat data such as damage dealt, healing done, kills, and other relevant metrics
    for the group's combat activities. The returned reference is immutable, ensuring
    that external code cannot modify the internal statistics directly. This method
    is typically used by game systems or modules that need to analyze or display combat
    performance data for groups during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the CombatStats object containing all combat-related
    statistics for the group trigger. The reference remains valid as long as the GroupCombatTrigger
    instance exists.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Combat Statistics
    code: 'const CombatStats& stats = groupCombatTrigger.GetStats();

      uint32 totalDamage = stats.totalDamageDealt;

      uint32 kills = stats.kills;

      printf("Total Damage: %u, Kills: %u\n", totalDamage, kills);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned CombatStats reference is valid only while the GroupCombatTrigger
    object remains alive. Accessing the stats after the trigger has been destroyed
    results in undefined behavior. This method does not perform any locking or synchronization,
    so it should be used carefully in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the CombatStats through the returned reference
    as it is const. If modifications are needed, use appropriate setter methods on
    the GroupCombatTrigger class instead.
