  class: IBotResourceMonitor
  method: RecordMemoryDeallocation
  signature: void IBotResourceMonitor::RecordMemoryDeallocation(size_t bytes)
documentation:
  brief: Records a memory deallocation event with the specified byte count for resource
    monitoring purposes.
  description: The RecordMemoryDeallocation method is used to log memory deallocations
    within the bot's resource management system. This method updates internal tracking
    mechanisms to monitor memory usage and ensure efficient resource handling. It
    is typically invoked when a bot releases allocated memory back to the system,
    allowing the monitoring system to maintain accurate statistics on memory consumption
    patterns. The method does not perform any direct memory operations but rather
    serves as a reporting mechanism for the resource monitor.
  parameters:
  - name: bytes
    description: The number of bytes that were deallocated from memory. This value
      should be a positive integer representing the size of the memory block being
      freed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Deallocation Recording
    code: 'IBotResourceMonitor* monitor = GetBotResourceMonitor();

      size_t deallocatedBytes = 1024;

      monitor->RecordMemoryDeallocation(deallocatedBytes);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Deallocation in Bot AI Logic
    code: "void BotAI::OnSpellCastFinished(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    //\
      \ ... some logic ...\n    if (m_allocatedMemory)\n    {\n        resourceMonitor->RecordMemoryDeallocation(m_allocatedMemory);\n\
      \        m_allocatedMemory = 0;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal resource monitoring infrastructure and
    should only be called by components that are directly managing bot memory allocation.
    The implementation likely uses thread-safe mechanisms to update shared counters
    or statistics. It's important to ensure that the byte count passed corresponds
    exactly to the amount of memory being freed to maintain accurate tracking.
  warnings: Incorrectly passing zero or negative values for bytes may lead to inaccurate
    resource tracking. This method should not be called without prior allocation tracking,
    as it only records deallocations and does not manage actual memory operations.
