  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: UpdatePopulationTargets
  signature: void BotSpawnOrchestrator::UpdatePopulationTargets()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the population targets for bot spawning based on current server conditions
    and configuration settings.
  description: The UpdatePopulationTargets method recalculates and adjusts the target
    numbers of bots that should be spawned across different zones or areas within
    the game world. This method is typically invoked during periodic updates or when
    system conditions change, such as player activity levels, server load, or configured
    spawn thresholds. It ensures that bot populations remain balanced according to
    predefined rules and maintains an optimal gaming experience for real players by
    preventing overcrowding or underpopulation in various zones. The method does not
    directly spawn or despawn bots but rather sets the desired population targets
    which are then processed by other components of the bot spawning system.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;

      orchestrator.UpdatePopulationTargets();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly as part of the bot system's update
    loop to maintain dynamic population balance. It may involve reading configuration
    files or querying database values to determine current target populations.
