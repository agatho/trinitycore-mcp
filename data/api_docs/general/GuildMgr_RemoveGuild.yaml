  signature: void GuildMgr::RemoveGuild(int guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a guild from the server by its unique identifier.
  description: The RemoveGuild method removes a guild from the TrinityCore server's
    database and in-memory structures. It takes a guild identifier as input and performs
    cleanup operations including removing all guild members, deleting guild achievements,
    and clearing related data from memory. This method is typically invoked when a
    guild is disbanded or deleted through administrative commands or game mechanics.
    The operation affects both persistent storage and runtime state, ensuring no references
    to the guild remain in the server's memory.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild to be removed. This must correspond
      to an existing guild in the database, otherwise the operation will have no effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Removal
    code: 'GuildMgr* guildMgr = sGuildMgr;

      guildMgr->RemoveGuild(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Guild Removal
    code: "GuildMgr* guildMgr = sGuildMgr;\nif (guildId > 0) {\n    guildMgr->RemoveGuild(guildId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid guild ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete removal of the guild including all associated
    data. It is not recommended to call this method directly from game logic without
    verifying that the guild exists and has no active members, as it may leave orphaned
    references or cause inconsistencies in related systems like guild banks or achievements.
  warnings: Calling RemoveGuild with an invalid or non-existent guildId will likely
    result in a no-op. Additionally, removing a guild while players are still online
    in that guild may cause client-side errors or unexpected behavior if not handled
    properly by the calling code.
