  class: StaticMapTree
  method: getObjectHitPos
  signature: bool StaticMapTree::getObjectHitPos(const int & pos1, const int & pos2,
    int & pResultHitPos, float pModifyDist) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the hit position of an object between two points in a static map
    tree.
  description: The getObjectHitPos method determines the precise intersection point
    of an object (such as a line or ray) with the geometry of a static map tree. It
    takes two positions (pos1 and pos2) and calculates where an object would intersect
    with the terrain or collision boundaries, adjusting for a modify distance parameter.
    This method is commonly used in pathfinding, line-of-sight checks, and collision
    detection within the TrinityCore framework. The method operates on precomputed
    static map data structures and is optimized for performance during gameplay operations.
  parameters:
  - name: pos1
    description: The starting position coordinate (int) in the map tree space.
  - name: pos2
    description: The ending position coordinate (int) in the map tree space.
  - name: pResultHitPos
    description: Output parameter that will hold the calculated hit position if the
      method returns true.
  - name: pModifyDist
    description: A distance modifier applied to adjust the final hit position, typically
      used for fine-tuning collision detection behavior.
  returns: Returns true if a valid intersection was found and pResultHitPos has been
    updated with the calculated hit position; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find object hit position
    code: "int startPos = 100;\nint endPos = 200;\nint hitPos;\nfloat modifyDist =\
      \ 0.5f;\nbool result = staticMapTree->getObjectHitPos(startPos, endPos, hitPos,\
      \ modifyDist);\nif (result) {\n    // Use hitPos for further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on precomputed static map tree data structures and assumes
    that the input coordinates are valid within the context of the map. The pModifyDist
    parameter allows for fine-tuning behavior, such as adjusting for object size or
    avoiding clipping issues.
  warnings: Ensure that pos1 and pos2 are within valid bounds of the static map tree
    to avoid undefined behavior. Incorrect usage of pModifyDist may lead to inaccurate
    hit positions.
