  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: ConfigureOrchestrator
  signature: void BotSpawnerAdapter::ConfigureOrchestrator()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and configures the orchestrator responsible for managing bot
    spawning operations within the TrinityCore environment.
  description: The ConfigureOrchestrator method sets up internal state and parameters
    required for the BotSpawnerAdapter to effectively manage the creation, deployment,
    and lifecycle of game bots. This method typically initializes configuration values
    such as spawn limits, cooldown periods, and integration points with the core World
    of Warcraft server mechanics. It ensures that all necessary systems are properly
    linked before bot spawning activities commence. The method is generally called
    during system initialization or when reconfiguring bot spawning behavior dynamically.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Call
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      adapter.ConfigureOrchestrator();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be invoked once during the initialization phase of
    the bot spawner system. Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or configuration
    conflicts. The method assumes that all dependent systems (such as database connections
    and AI modules) are already initialized.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within a multithreaded context without proper
    synchronization, as it may cause race conditions in internal state management.
    Avoid calling this method after the bot spawner has started actively spawning
    bots to prevent inconsistent behavior.
