  class: InterruptManager
  method: CalculateInterruptUrgency
  signature: float InterruptManager::CalculateInterruptUrgency(const InterruptTarget
    & target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the urgency level of an interrupt target based on various combat
    and spell-related factors.
  description: The CalculateInterruptUrgency method evaluates how critical it is to
    interrupt a specific target's current spell or ability. This calculation considers
    factors such as the target's casting time, the type of spell being cast, the caster's
    current threat level, and the potential damage or effect that would occur if the
    interrupt fails. The method returns a float value representing the urgency score,
    where higher values indicate more critical interrupts that should be prioritized.
    This functionality is typically used by AI systems to determine which targets
    require immediate attention during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated interrupt urgency level. Higher
    values indicate more urgent interrupts requiring immediate action. The exact scale
    and interpretation may vary based on internal game mechanics and AI decision-making
    logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "class CombatAI {\n    InterruptManager* interruptMgr;\n    void Update()\
      \ {\n        if (auto target = GetTarget()) {\n            float urgency = interruptMgr->CalculateInterruptUrgency(*target);\n\
      \            if (urgency > 0.8f) {\n                // Prioritize interrupting\
      \ this target\n                PerformInterrupt(target);\n            }\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex calculations involving spell data, combat
    state information, and AI decision trees. The implementation may cache certain
    values for performance optimization. It's designed to be called frequently during
    combat updates, so performance considerations are important.
  warnings: The method assumes valid target data is provided; calling it with invalid
    or null targets could lead to undefined behavior. The urgency scores should not
    be directly compared across different AI contexts without proper normalization.
