  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: CoordinateGroupAttack
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::CoordinateGroupAttack(uint32 groupId, int
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates group attack actions for a specified player group
  description: The CoordinateGroupAttack method manages and synchronizes attack behaviors
    across multiple player bots within a defined group. It ensures that all group
    members execute coordinated attacks against a common target, maintaining tactical
    unity during combat scenarios. This method typically handles the distribution
    of attack commands, synchronization of timing, and coordination of targeting strategies
    to maximize group effectiveness in battle.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier for the player bot group that will coordinate the
      attack
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target ID or index for the
      coordinated attack
  returns: No return value (void)
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Attack Coordination
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = PlayerbotAI::GetGroupManager();

      uint32 groupId = 1;

      int targetId = 42;

      groupMgr->CoordinateGroupAttack(groupId, &targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in player bot AI systems where multiple bots
    need to act in unison. The target parameter should point to a valid target ID
    that all group members can access and engage. Implementation may involve checking
    group member availability, target validity, and ensuring proper combat state synchronization.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupId corresponds to an active group, otherwise behavior
    is undefined. The target pointer must not be null or point to invalid memory.
    Improper usage may result in bots attacking incorrect targets or failing to coordinate
    properly.
