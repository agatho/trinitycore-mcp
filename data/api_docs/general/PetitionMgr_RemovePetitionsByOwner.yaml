  class: PetitionMgr
  method: RemovePetitionsByOwner
  signature: void PetitionMgr::RemovePetitionsByOwner(int ownerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all petitions associated with a specified owner GUID from the petition
    manager.
  description: The RemovePetitionsByOwner method removes all petition entries that
    are owned by a specific player, identified by their GUID. This function is typically
    used when a player's account is deleted or when cleaning up stale petition data.
    The method iterates through the internal petition storage and deletes any petitions
    where the ownerGuid matches the provided parameter. It ensures no dangling references
    remain in the system after removal. This operation affects only the in-memory
    representation of petitions and does not directly interact with database persistence
    unless triggered by a broader cleanup process.
  parameters:
  - name: ownerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose petitions should
      be removed. Must be a valid player GUID; negative values or invalid identifiers
      may result in no action being taken.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove all petitions owned by a specific player
    code: 'PetitionMgr* petitionMgr = sPetitionMgr;

      uint32 playerId = 12345;

      petitionMgr->RemovePetitionsByOwner(playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided ownerGuid corresponds to a valid player
    in the system. It is recommended to validate the GUID before calling this function
    to avoid unintended behavior. The implementation likely uses internal data structures
    such as maps or lists for efficient lookup and removal of petition entries.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may not produce
    any errors but will also not perform any deletions. Ensure that all petition-related
    operations are synchronized if used in a multi-threaded environment to prevent
    race conditions during data modification.
