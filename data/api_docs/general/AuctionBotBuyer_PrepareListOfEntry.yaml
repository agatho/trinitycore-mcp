    structures used by the AuctionBotBuyer class to manage purchase configurations.
    This method processes the provided BuyerConfiguration object, setting up necessary
    parameters such as item categories, price thresholds, and bidding strategies.
    It ensures that all required fields are properly validated and configured before
    the auction bot begins processing buy orders. The method typically runs during
    initialization or when configuration changes are detected, preparing the system
    for subsequent auction scanning and purchasing operations.
