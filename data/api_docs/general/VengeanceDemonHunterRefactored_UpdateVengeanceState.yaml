  signature: void VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::UpdateVengeanceState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the vengeance state of the Demon Hunter class based on current combat
    actions and abilities.
  description: The UpdateVengeanceState method is responsible for recalculating and
    applying the current vengeance state for a Demon Hunter character within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method typically integrates with the player's combat actions,
    ability usage, and damage dealt or taken to determine how vengeance points are
    accumulated or consumed. It ensures that the Demon Hunter's vengeance mechanics
    remain synchronized with the game's internal state, affecting abilities such as
    Vengeance-based damage boosts or resource generation. The method is generally
    invoked during combat events or periodic updates to maintain accurate state tracking.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Event
    code: "void SomeCombatHandler::OnPlayerAttack(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (Player*\
      \ player = dynamic_cast<Player*>(GetCaster()))\n    {\n        if (VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored*\
      \ dh = player->GetVengeanceDemonHunter())\n        {\n            dh->UpdateVengeanceState();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently during combat scenarios,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account when implementing logic
    inside it. It may interact with other systems such as threat generation or ability
    cooldowns.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method outside of appropriate combat contexts
    could lead to incorrect vengeance state calculations or unexpected behavior in
    abilities tied to the Demon Hunter's vengeance system.
