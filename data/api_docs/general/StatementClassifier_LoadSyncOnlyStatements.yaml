documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes synchronous database statements for the StatementClassifier.
  description: The LoadSyncOnlyStatements method is responsible for loading only the
    synchronous database statements that are required for the StatementClassifier
    to function properly. This method ensures that all necessary SQL queries are pre-loaded
    into memory, allowing for efficient execution without repeated parsing or compilation
    of SQL commands. It typically runs during server initialization or when the statement
    classifier needs to refresh its internal statement cache. The method does not
    load asynchronous statements, which are handled separately. This approach improves
    performance by reducing database overhead and ensuring that critical synchronous
    operations can execute quickly.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'StatementClassifier classifier;

      classifier.LoadSyncOnlyStatements();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server startup or when statement
    cache invalidation is required. It's designed to be thread-safe and may be invoked
    from multiple threads simultaneously without causing data corruption. The method
    assumes that the database connection is already established and valid.
  warnings: Calling this method while active database operations are in progress may
    lead to inconsistent state. Avoid calling it during high-traffic periods or when
    other components depend on the statement cache being stable.
