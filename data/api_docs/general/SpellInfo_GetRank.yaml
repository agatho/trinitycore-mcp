documentation:
  brief: Returns the rank of the spell as defined in the SpellInfo structure.
  description: The GetRank method retrieves the rank value associated with a specific
    spell within the TrinityCore database. This value represents the hierarchical
    level of the spell, typically used for determining spell progression and advancement
    in player character abilities. The method is commonly employed in spell handling
    logic where the rank determines the effectiveness or strength of a spell based
    on its position in the spell tree. It is particularly useful when checking spell
    levels, calculating spell damage, or determining spell cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the rank value as an 8-bit unsigned integer, representing the spell's
    hierarchical level within the game system. A rank of 0 typically indicates a basic
    spell, while higher ranks denote more advanced versions of the same spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint8 rank = spellInfo->GetRank();\nif (rank > 0)\n{\n    // Process advanced\
      \ spell logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellInfo class and should be used carefully when
    accessing spell data. The rank value is usually derived from the database entries
    for spells, and may not always reflect the actual in-game level of a spell. Ensure
    that the spell information has been properly loaded before calling this method.
  warnings: This method does not perform any validation checks on the input data;
    it simply returns the stored rank value. If used with invalid or uninitialized
    SpellInfo objects, it may return unexpected results or cause undefined behavior.
