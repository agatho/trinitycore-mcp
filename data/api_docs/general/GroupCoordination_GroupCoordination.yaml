documentation:
  brief: Initializes group coordination for the specified group ID.
  description: The GroupCoordination method is responsible for setting up or initializing
    the coordination mechanism for a specific group within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method likely prepares internal data structures or registers the group for
    coordinated activities such as instance management, loot distribution, or raid
    synchronization. The method operates on a group identifier and may involve setting
    up group-specific flags, initializing shared variables, or preparing communication
    channels between group members. It is typically invoked when a new group is formed
    or when coordination needs to be established for existing groups.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Group Coordination
    code: 'GroupCoordination coord;

      coord.GroupCoordination(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger group management system and may interact
    with other subsystems such as instance handling or player tracking. It should
    be called after a group has been properly initialized but before any coordinated
    actions are expected.
