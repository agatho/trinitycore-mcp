  method: SetFarVisible
  signature: void WorldObject::SetFarVisible(bool on)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the far visibility state of the WorldObject, determining whether it
    should be rendered at extended distances.
  description: The SetFarVisible method controls whether a WorldObject is visible
    at far distances in the game world. This functionality is crucial for performance
    optimization and visual fidelity in TrinityCore's rendering system. When set to
    true, the object becomes visible even when located far from the player's view,
    while setting it to false ensures that distant objects are not rendered unless
    they come within normal visibility range. The method directly affects the object's
    presence in the client's update packets and can influence memory usage and network
    bandwidth consumption.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Far Visibility for a GameObject
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...; // some game object

      go->SetFarVisible(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Far Visibility for a Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...; // some creature

      creature->SetFarVisible(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal flags that affect how the object is processed
    during world updates. It's typically used for special objects like quest items
    or environmental elements that need to remain visible even at great distances.
    The change takes effect immediately upon calling the method.
  warnings: Modifying far visibility can impact performance if overused on numerous
    objects. Be cautious when setting many objects to far visible as it increases
    network traffic and client rendering load. Also, ensure proper synchronization
    with other visibility-related methods to avoid unexpected behavior.
