documentation:
  brief: Calculates the total base spell damage bonus for a specified school mask.
  description: This method computes the sum of all base spell damage bonuses applied
    to a given school type. It aggregates contributions from various sources including
    buffs, debuffs, and character attributes that affect spell damage. The result
    represents the baseline enhancement added to spell damage calculations before
    any modifiers or multipliers are applied. This is commonly used in spell calculation
    logic for determining base damage components in World of Warcraft mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the total base spell damage bonus
    for the specified school mask. A positive value indicates bonus damage, while
    a negative value represents penalty damage. Zero indicates no base bonus or penalty
    exists for that school type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 bonus = unit->SpellBaseDamageBonusDone(SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_fire);\n\
      if (bonus > 0)\n    std::cout << \"Fire damage bonus: \" << bonus << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell calculation
    methods to determine final spell damage values. It may be affected by various
    game mechanics such as talent points, buffs effects, and character attributes.
    The method should be called within a thread-safe context if used in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: The method does not account for modifiers or multipliers that might affect
    the final damage calculation; it only returns base bonuses. Be aware that different
    school types may have different base bonus values depending on the character's
    class and talents.
