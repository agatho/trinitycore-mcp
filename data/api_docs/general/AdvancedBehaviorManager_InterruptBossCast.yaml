  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: InterruptBossCast
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::InterruptBossCast(Creature * boss, uint32
    spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts an ongoing boss spell cast by the specified creature.
  description: The InterruptBossCast method is used to forcefully interrupt a boss
    creature's current spell casting. This method is typically employed in advanced
    AI behavior scripting to manage combat encounters, particularly when a specific
    spell needs to be stopped before completion. The method takes a pointer to the
    boss creature and the spell ID of the cast to be interrupted. It ensures that
    the boss will stop its current casting animation and return to normal behavior
    immediately. This functionality is crucial for implementing complex encounter
    mechanics where timing and control over boss abilities are essential.
  parameters:
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the boss whose spell
      cast needs to be interrupted. Must not be null.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell that is currently being cast by
      the boss. Used to identify which specific cast should be interrupted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Cast Interruption
    code: "void MyBossAI::OnPlayerEnterCombat(Player* player)\n{\n    if (Creature*\
      \ boss = me->GetCreature(*me, bossGuid))\n    {\n        InterruptBossCast(boss,\
      \ 12345);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupting Specific Boss Spell in Encounter
    code: "void AdvancedBehaviorManager::HandleSpecialAbility()\n{\n    if (Creature*\
      \ boss = GetBossCreature())\n    {\n        if (boss->IsNonMeleeSpellCasted(false))\n\
      \        {\n            InterruptBossCast(boss, boss->GetCurrentSpell()->m_spellInfo->Id);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the boss is actively casting a spell.
    Calling it on a boss that is not casting will have no effect. The method does
    not validate whether the spell being interrupted is actually the one specified
    by spellId, so ensure correct usage to prevent unintended behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null creature pointer will result
    in undefined behavior. Always verify that the boss exists and is casting before
    calling this method. Additionally, interrupting a spell may cause unexpected AI
    state changes if not handled properly within the broader encounter logic.
