  method: IsTaximaskNodeKnown
  signature: bool PlayerTaxi::IsTaximaskNodeKnown(uint32 nodeidx) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific taxi node is known to the player.
  description: The IsTaximaskNodeKnown method determines if a given taxi node index
    has been discovered and is available for use by the player. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with the player's taxi mask, which tracks all known flight
    paths within the game world. The method performs a bitwise check against the player's
    internal taxi mask to verify if the specified node index is marked as known. This
    functionality is essential for determining which destinations a player can fly
    to using the taxi system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the taxi node specified by nodeidx is known to the player,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the player has discovered
    and can use this flight path.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific taxi node is known
    code: "if (player->GetTaxi().IsTaximaskNodeKnown(1234)) {\n    // Player knows\
      \ this taxi node\n    player->AddTaxiPathToMap(1234);\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ does not know this taxi node\n    player->SendTaxiMenu();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal taxi mask that is updated when players
    discover new flight paths. The nodeidx parameter should correspond to a valid
    taxi node ID from the game's database. Performance-wise, this is a fast bitwise
    operation and should not cause noticeable lag.
