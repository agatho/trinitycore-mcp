  class: Creature
  method: GetPetAutoSpellSize
  signature: uint8 Creature::GetPetAutoSpellSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the size of the pet's auto spell list for this creature.
  description: This method retrieves the number of auto spells that a creature's pet
    can cast, which is used to determine how many spells are available in the pet's
    auto spell list. The value returned represents the count of spells in the pet's
    auto spell list, typically used for determining the size of the pet's spell casting
    behavior. This method is essential for understanding how many auto spells a creature's
    pet can cast and is commonly used in pet AI implementations to manage spell selection
    and behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the number of auto spells available
    for this creature's pet, which typically ranges from 0-255 depending on the creature's
    pet configuration and behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 spellCount = creature->GetPetAutoSpellSize();\nif (spellCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Pet has auto spells available\n    // Do something with the spell\
      \ count\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Creature class and is used primarily in pet AI
    logic. The returned value may vary depending on the creature's type and configuration,
    and it's typically used to determine how many auto spells are available for a
    pet to cast.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without understanding the context
    of pet behavior. It's important to note that this value may change based on creature
    configuration and is often used in conjunction with other pet-related methods.
