documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes vendor data for all NPCs from the database
  description: The LoadVendors method retrieves vendor item information from the database
    and populates the ObjectMgr's internal vendor data structures. This method is
    typically called during server startup or database reload operations to ensure
    that all NPC vendors have their correct item lists available. It processes entries
    from the creature_template, npc_vendor, and related tables to build in-memory
    caches of vendor inventories. The method handles loading of items, prices, quantities,
    and other vendor-specific properties for each vendor NPC in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Startup
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadVendors();\n\
      \    // Vendor data is now loaded and available\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Database Reload Context
    code: "void HandleReloadCommand(ChatHandler* handler) {\n    sObjectMgr->LoadVendors();\n\
      \    handler->SendSysMessage(\"Vendor data reloaded successfully.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server initialization and database
    reload operations. It performs database queries to fetch vendor item data and
    caches this information in memory for fast access during gameplay. The method
    may be called multiple times during runtime if the database content changes, but
    it's designed to handle incremental updates efficiently.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are actively trading with vendors may
    cause temporary inconsistencies or require additional synchronization logic. The
    method assumes that all related database tables (creature_template, npc_vendor)
    are properly structured and contain valid data.
