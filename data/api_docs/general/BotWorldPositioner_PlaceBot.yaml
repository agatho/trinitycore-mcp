  signature: bool BotWorldPositioner::PlaceBot(Player * bot, uint32 level, int faction,
    uint8 race)
documentation:
  brief: Places a bot player at a valid world position with specified attributes.
  description: The PlaceBot method is responsible for positioning a bot player within
    the game world. It takes a Player pointer representing the bot, along with level,
    faction, and race parameters to configure the bot's initial state. The method
    attempts to find an appropriate location in the world where the bot can be placed,
    considering factors such as terrain, collision detection, and valid spawn points.
    This function is typically used during bot creation or respawn scenarios within
    TrinityCore's AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot to be placed in
      the world
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot player, determining its stats and abilities
  - name: faction
    description: The faction ID that determines the bot's alignment and interactions
      with other players
  - name: race
    description: The race of the bot player, defining its visual appearance and base
      attributes
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully placed at a valid world position;
    otherwise returns false if placement fails due to invalid parameters or world
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Placement
    code: "Player* myBot = new Player();\nbool success = botWorldPositioner->PlaceBot(myBot,\
      \ 80, 14, RACE_HUMAN);\nif (success) {\n    // Bot placed successfully\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle placement failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Bot Placement with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = GetNewBot();\nuint32 level = 70;\nint faction = 14;\nuint8\
      \ race = RACE_ORC;\n\nif (!bot) {\n    // Handle invalid bot pointer\n    return\
      \ false;\n}\n\nbool result = botWorldPositioner->PlaceBot(bot, level, faction,\
      \ race);\nif (!result) {\n    // Log error or attempt alternative placement\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to place bot at world position\");\n    return\
      \ false;\n}\n// Bot successfully placed and ready for use"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation of input parameters before
    attempting to place the bot. It may interact with TrinityCore's MapManager and
    GridMap systems to find valid positions. The method might also update the bot's
    position in the world database if persistence is required.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is properly initialized and not
    null. Passing invalid faction or race values can lead to undefined behavior or
    failed placement attempts. This function should be called from a thread-safe context
    when dealing with concurrent bot management.
