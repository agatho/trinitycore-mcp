  description: The GetActionButtons method retrieves the complete list of action buttons
    associated with the player character. This method provides access to the player's
    action bar configuration, including all slots from 1 to 132. The returned ActionButtonList
    contains information about each action button's slot, spell ID, and other relevant
    data. This method is essential for managing player actions and understanding the
    current action bar setup.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to the ActionButtonList containing all action
    buttons for this player. The list includes all 132 action slots with their associated
    spell IDs and other metadata.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Player Action Buttons
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nconst ActionButtonList& actionButtons =\
      \ player->GetActionButtons();\nfor (auto button : actionButtons)\n{\n    if\
      \ (button->spellId != 0)\n    {\n        // Process valid action button\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a const reference to avoid copying the entire list. This
    is an efficient implementation that allows direct access to player action buttons
    without unnecessary memory allocation.
  warnings: Be careful when modifying action buttons through this interface, as it
    may affect gameplay mechanics and could lead to unexpected behavior if not handled
    properly.
