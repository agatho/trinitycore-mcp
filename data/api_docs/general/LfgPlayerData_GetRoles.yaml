  method: GetRoles
  signature: uint8 LfgPlayerData::GetRoles() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the roles assigned to a player in the LFG system.
  description: The GetRoles method returns a bitmask representing the roles that have
    been assigned to a player within the Looking for Group (LFG) system. This bitmask
    encodes information about whether the player is suitable for being a tank, healer,
    or damage dealer (DPS) in group content such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds.
    The returned value can be used to determine the player's role preferences and
    capabilities when forming groups or matching players together for content.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A uint8 bitmask where each bit represents a specific role: bit 0 (1) indicates
    Tank, bit 1 (2) indicates Healer, and bit 2 (4) indicates DPS. Multiple roles
    can be combined using bitwise OR operations. For example, a value of 7 (binary
    111) means the player is suitable for all three roles.'
  examples:
  - title: Check if player is a tank
    code: "uint8 roles = playerData->GetRoles();\nif (roles & LFG_ROLE_TANK)\n{\n\
      \    // Player can be assigned as a tank\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine if player is suitable for DPS
    code: "uint8 roles = playerData->GetRoles();\nbool isDps = (roles & LFG_ROLE_DPS)\
      \ != 0;\nif (isDps)\n{\n    // Player can be assigned as a DPS\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation or updates to the internal role
    state. It simply returns the cached role information stored in the LfgPlayerData
    object. The bitmask values are defined by the LFG system constants such as LFG_ROLE_TANK,
    LFG_ROLE_HEALER, and LFG_ROLE_DPS.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned value is a bitmask and may contain multiple
    roles set simultaneously. Always use bitwise operations when checking for specific
    roles rather than direct equality comparisons.
