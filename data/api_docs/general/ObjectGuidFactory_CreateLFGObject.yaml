  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateLFGObject
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateLFGObject(uint8 arg1, uint8 arg2,
    uint8 arg3, uint8 arg4, bool arg5, uint8 arg6, uint64 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new ObjectGuid for a Looking For Group (LFG) object
    with specified parameters.
  description: The CreateLFGObject method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically
    designed for Looking For Group (LFG) related objects within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is typically used to assign identifiers to LFG-related entities such
    as groups, dungeons, or matchmaking entries. The generated GUID incorporates several
    configuration parameters that define the object's type, subtype, and other identifying
    characteristics. The method ensures proper GUID structure alignment with World
    of Warcraft's internal object management system, making it suitable for use in
    game state tracking, network synchronization, and object referencing within the
    LFG subsystem.
  parameters:
  - name: arg1
    description: First configuration byte that typically defines the LFG object type
      or category
  - name: arg2
    description: Second configuration byte used for specifying subtypes or additional
      flags
  - name: arg3
    description: Third configuration byte, often used to encode specific properties
      or settings of the LFG object
  - name: arg4
    description: Fourth configuration byte that may represent versioning or reserved
      fields for future use
  - name: arg5
    description: Boolean flag indicating special properties or states of the LFG object
      (e.g., active/inactive status)
  - name: arg6
    description: Sixth configuration byte used for additional categorization or priority
      settings
  - name: counter
    description: 64-bit counter value that ensures uniqueness of the generated GUID
      across all LFG objects
  returns: Returns a fully constructed ObjectGuid instance representing the newly
    created LFG object. The returned GUID follows World of Warcraft's standard GUID
    format with proper type identification for LFG-related entities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic LFG Object Creation
    code: ObjectGuid lfgGuid = guidFactory.CreateLFGObject(1, 2, 3, 4, true, 5, 1000ULL);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating LFG Dungeon Group GUID
    code: ObjectGuid dungeonGroupGuid = guidFactory.CreateLFGObject(0x01, 0x02, 0x03,
      0x04, false, 0x05, time(nullptr));
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectGuidFactory class and should be used when
    creating LFG-related objects that require unique identification within the game
    world. The counter parameter must be unique to prevent GUID collisions. The method
    internally handles proper bit manipulation and structure alignment according to
    TrinityCore's GUID generation standards.
  warnings: Ensure that the counter value is properly managed to avoid GUID collisions,
    especially in high-frequency creation scenarios. The boolean argument should be
    carefully considered as it may affect how the LFG system interprets the object's
    state or behavior.
