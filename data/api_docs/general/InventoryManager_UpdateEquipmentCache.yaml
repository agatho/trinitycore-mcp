documentation:
  brief: Updates the cached equipment information for the player's inventory.
  description: The UpdateEquipmentCache method refreshes the internal cache of equipped
    items for a player. This method is typically called when equipment changes occur,
    such as when an item is equipped, unequipped, or modified. It ensures that subsequent
    queries about the player's currently equipped items return accurate and up-to-date
    information. The cache update process involves iterating through the player's
    inventory slots and recording the currently equipped items in a structured format
    for quick access. This method is crucial for maintaining consistency between the
    player's visual equipment display and the underlying item data.

    implementing custom inventory management logic or debugging equipment state issues.
