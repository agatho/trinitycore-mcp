  method: DetectUnfairTrade
  signature: bool TradeSystem::DetectUnfairTrade(const TradeSession & session)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes a trade session to detect potentially unfair or exploitative trading
    behavior.
  description: The DetectUnfairTrade method evaluates the provided TradeSession for
    signs of cheating, exploitation, or other forms of unfair gameplay. It examines
    item values, trade ratios, and player behavior within the session to determine
    if the trade is legitimate. This function is typically used by the TrinityCore
    server's anti-cheat system to maintain game integrity and prevent exploits such
    as item duplication, excessive value exchanges, or other anomalies that could
    disrupt the game economy. The method returns true if unfair trade practices are
    detected, and false otherwise. It may be called during trade validation, logging,
    or reporting processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trade session contains evidence of unfair or exploitative
    behavior; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Trade Validation
    code: "bool isUnfair = tradeSystem.DetectUnfairTrade(session);\nif (isUnfair)\
      \ {\n    // Log the unfair trade and potentially cancel it\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Unfair trade detected between players.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks such as comparing item values against
    market rates, detecting unusual trade ratios, or identifying known exploit patterns.
    It may be computationally intensive and is typically run asynchronously or during
    non-critical moments to avoid performance impact.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this function for trade enforcement without additional
    logging or user notification. The detection logic may evolve over time and could
    produce false positives in edge cases.
