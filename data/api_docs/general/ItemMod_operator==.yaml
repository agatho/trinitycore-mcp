  class: ItemMod
  method: operator==
  signature: bool ItemMod::operator==(const ItemMod & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ItemMod objects for equality based on their internal data members.
  description: The operator== method performs a component-wise comparison between
    this ItemMod object and another ItemMod object provided as a parameter. It evaluates
    whether both objects contain identical data, typically used to determine if two
    item modifications are equivalent. This is commonly utilized in inventory management
    systems within TrinityCore to check for duplicate enchantments or stat modifications
    on items. The comparison usually involves checking fields such as modification
    type, value, and other relevant attributes that define an item's modification
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The ItemMod object to compare against this instance. This parameter
      represents the right-hand side operand in the equality comparison.
  returns: Returns true if all corresponding data members of both ItemMod objects
    are equal; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equality Check
    code: 'ItemMod mod1;

      ItemMod mod2;

      bool isEqual = (mod1 == mod2); // Returns true if both mods have identical data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Inventory Duplicate Detection
    code: "std::vector<ItemMod> inventoryMods;\nItemMod newMod;\nbool hasDuplicate\
      \ = false;\nfor (const auto& existingMod : inventoryMods) {\n    if (newMod\
      \ == existingMod) {\n        hasDuplicate = true;\n        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using member-wise comparison, which
    means it may not be suitable for complex objects with pointers or dynamic memory.
    Performance is generally O(n) where n is the number of data members being compared.
    The implementation assumes that all relevant fields are properly initialized and
    comparable.
  warnings: Be cautious when comparing ItemMod objects that contain floating-point
    values; slight precision differences might cause equality checks to fail unexpectedly.
    Ensure that both objects are in a valid state before comparison to avoid undefined
    behavior.
