  signature: void WorldSession::SetInQueue(bool state)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's in-queue status for server connection or realm access.
  description: The SetInQueue method updates the internal state of a WorldSession
    to indicate whether the player is currently in a queue for server access or realm
    joining. This status flag is used by the TrinityCore authentication and connection
    handling systems to manage player login flow, prevent duplicate connections, and
    control access to realms during server maintenance or high-load periods. When
    set to true, the session enters a queued state which typically prevents further
    authentication attempts until the queue is cleared. The method does not perform
    any network operations itself but modifies internal session flags that are checked
    by other subsystems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting player in queue during login
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->SetInQueue(true);\n\
      \    // Player is now marked as being in queue\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing queue status after authentication
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->SetInQueue(false);\n\
      \    // Player is no longer in queue, can proceed with normal gameplay\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal session state flags only. The actual queuing
    behavior is handled by the authentication system and realm management components.
    The in-queue flag should be set appropriately during login sequence to prevent
    connection issues. This method is typically called internally by TrinityCore's
    session management code.
  warnings: Setting this flag incorrectly may cause players to remain stuck in queue
    states or be unable to connect properly. Always ensure proper state transitions
    when calling this method, especially during authentication and realm switching
    operations.
