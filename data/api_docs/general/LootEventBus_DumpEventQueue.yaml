  brief: Dumps the contents of the loot event queue to the console for debugging purposes.
  description: The DumpEventQueue method outputs all pending loot events currently
    stored in the LootEventBus queue to the system console or log. This utility function
    is primarily used during development and debugging to inspect the state of active
    loot events, such as those related to item drops, loot generation, or event processing.
    It does not modify any internal state and serves purely for diagnostic purposes.
    The method is typically invoked when troubleshooting loot-related issues or verifying
    that events are being correctly queued and processed within the TrinityCore framework.

    which could impact performance if used excessively.
