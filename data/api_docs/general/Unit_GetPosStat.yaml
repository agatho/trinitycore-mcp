documentation:
  brief: Returns the current value of a specified stat for the unit.
  description: The GetPosStat method retrieves the current value of a specific stat
    from a Unit object, which can represent players or NPCs in World of Warcraft.
    This method is commonly used to access various attributes such as strength, agility,
    stamina, intellect, and other character stats. The returned value represents the
    base stat value plus any bonuses applied through buffs, gear, or other game mechanics.
    It's important to note that this method does not return the total stat value including
    modifiers; it returns only the base stat value before applying any modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float representing the current base value of the specified stat.
    If the stat is invalid or not found, the method returns 0.0f.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float strength = unit->GetPosStat(STAT_STR);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'float agility = unit->GetPosStat(STAT_AGI);

      float totalAgility = unit->GetPosStat(STAT_AGI) + unit->GetTotalStat(STAT_AGI);

      // This demonstrates how to get base stat vs total stat'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for retrieving base stats before applying modifiers.
    It's important to understand that this method returns only the base value, not
    including any buffs or gear bonuses. Performance considerations include checking
    if the stat exists before calling this method.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when dealing with stats that may
    have been modified by buffs or gear, as it only returns the base value without
    considering these modifications. Also, be aware that invalid stat indices will
    return 0.0f.
