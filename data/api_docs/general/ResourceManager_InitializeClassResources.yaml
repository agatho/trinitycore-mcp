documentation:
  brief: Initializes class-specific resource configurations for all player classes
    in the game.
  description: The InitializeClassResources method sets up and loads the default resource
    configurations for all playable classes within the TrinityCore framework. This
    includes initializing health, mana, rage, energy, and other class-specific resource
    pools with their base values and scaling factors. The method is typically called
    during server startup or when loading class data from configuration files and
    database entries. It ensures that each class has proper resource definitions before
    any player instances are created or game mechanics are executed. This initialization
    process is crucial for maintaining consistent gameplay behavior across all classes
    and prevents runtime errors related to missing resource configurations.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'ResourceManager::InitializeClassResources();

      // Called during server startup to initialize all class resources'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. It's
    typically invoked from the main server startup routine before any game world processing
    begins. The method may trigger database queries to fetch class-specific resource
    definitions if not cached in memory.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times can lead to duplicate resource configurations
    and potential memory leaks. Ensure that all class resource data is properly validated
    before initialization to prevent inconsistent gameplay states.
