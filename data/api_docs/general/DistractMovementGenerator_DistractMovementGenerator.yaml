  class: DistractMovementGenerator
  method: DistractMovementGenerator
  signature: void DistractMovementGenerator::DistractMovementGenerator(int timer,
    float orientation)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a distraction movement generator with specified timer and orientation
    values.
  description: The DistractMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement generator
    that causes an AI-controlled unit to move in a specific direction for a set duration.
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to create temporary movement
    behaviors such as fleeing, evading, or being distracted by environmental events.
    The timer parameter defines how long the distraction lasts, while the orientation
    determines the direction of movement. This generator is typically employed during
    AI state transitions where a creature needs to be temporarily diverted from its
    primary behavior path.
  parameters:
  - name: timer
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the distraction effect should
      last. This value controls how long the unit will move in the specified direction
      before returning to normal behavior.
  - name: orientation
    description: The target orientation (in radians) that defines the direction the
      unit should move during the distraction period. This angle is typically calculated
      based on the source of the distraction or the desired escape direction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distraction Movement Initialization
    code: DistractMovementGenerator distractGen(3000, M_PI / 4); // Distraction for
      3 seconds at 45-degree angle
    language: cpp
  - title: Using DistractMovementGenerator in AI Context
    code: "void CreatureAI::OnReceiveDamage(Unit* attacker)\n{\n    if (me->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30)\n    {\n        // Start distraction movement when health drops below\
      \ 30%\n        me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveDistract(2000, attacker->GetOrientation());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's movement generator system and should
    only be called on AI-controlled creatures. The orientation parameter expects radians,
    not degrees. The timer value must be positive to have any meaningful effect.
  warnings: Improper use of this constructor can lead to unexpected movement behavior
    or AI state corruption. Ensure that the timer is set appropriately to avoid infinite
    distraction states. Avoid calling this method on player characters as it's designed
    specifically for NPC movement.
