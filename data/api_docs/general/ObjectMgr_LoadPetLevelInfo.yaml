documentation:
  brief: Loads pet level experience and stat information from database tables into
    memory for use during pet evolution and growth.
  description: The LoadPetLevelInfo method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with pet level-up statistics and experience requirements from the game's
    database. This includes loading data such as health, mana, damage, and experience
    points needed to reach each level for different pet types. The method is typically
    invoked during server startup or when reloading pet-related configurations. It
    processes multiple database tables containing pet level information and caches
    this data for efficient access during gameplay. This ensures that pets can properly
    level up and gain stats according to predefined rules.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadPetLevelInfo()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadPetLevelInfo();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called automatically during server startup and should not
    be invoked manually unless reloading pet data. The loaded information is cached
    in memory for fast access during combat and pet leveling operations. Performance
    is optimized through efficient database queries and caching mechanisms.
