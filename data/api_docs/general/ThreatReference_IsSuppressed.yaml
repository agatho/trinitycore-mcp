  class: ThreatReference
  method: IsSuppressed
  signature: bool ThreatReference::IsSuppressed() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the threat reference is currently suppressed.
  description: The IsSuppressed method determines if a ThreatReference object is in
    a suppressed state, which typically means that the threat it represents is not
    actively contributing to the target's aggro list. This suppression can occur due
    to various game mechanics such as spell effects, abilities, or environmental conditions
    that temporarily reduce or nullify threat generation. The method returns a boolean
    value indicating the suppression status of the reference.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat reference is currently suppressed, false otherwise.
    A suppressed reference does not contribute to threat calculations or aggro generation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (threatRef.IsSuppressed()) {\n    // Handle suppressed threat logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Threat is currently suppressed\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Aggro Management
    code: "void UpdateAggroStatus(ThreatReference& threatRef) {\n    if (threatRef.IsSuppressed())\
      \ {\n        // Skip threat-based aggro updates\n        return;\n    }\n  \
      \  // Proceed with normal threat handling\n    threatRef.AddThreat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI and threat management systems within
    the TrinityCore framework. The suppression state may be modified by various game
    effects such as stealth, fear, or specific spell mechanics that temporarily disable
    threat generation.
  warnings: Ensure that the ThreatReference object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized reference could lead to undefined
    behavior. Also note that suppression status can change dynamically during combat,
    so repeated calls may yield different results.
