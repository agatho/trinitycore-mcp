documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified battle pet species is classified as rare.
  description: The IsRarePet method checks if a given battle pet species ID corresponds
    to a rare-quality pet in the World of Warcraft Battle Pet system. This method
    evaluates the pet's species against internal criteria that define rarity, such
    as pet type, level requirements, or special event conditions. It is commonly used
    in game logic to determine special behaviors, rewards, or visual effects associated
    with rare pets. The method does not require any additional parameters beyond the
    species ID and returns a boolean value indicating the pet's rarity status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified battle pet species is classified as rare;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Pet is Rare
    code: "if (battlePetManager->IsRarePet(1234))\n{\n    // Handle rare pet logic\n\
      \    ChatHandler(ch).SendSysMessage(\"This is a rare pet!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely relies on internal Battle Pet data tables or configurations
    that define which species are considered rare. This method should be used carefully
    in performance-critical code paths as it may involve lookups or comparisons against
    a database of pet definitions.
