  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: UpdatePopulationCache
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::UpdatePopulationCache()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal cache of bot population data for all active game worlds.
  description: The UpdatePopulationCache method refreshes the cached statistics and
    counts of active bot populations across all connected realms within the TrinityCore
    instance. This method is typically invoked periodically or in response to significant
    changes in bot deployment, such as when new bots are added or existing ones are
    removed from gameplay. It ensures that subsequent queries for bot population data
    return up-to-date information without requiring expensive real-time calculations.
    The cache update process may involve iterating through all active sessions and
    aggregating relevant bot-related metrics.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // Periodically update bot population cache\n \
      \   sBotPopulationManager->UpdatePopulationCache();\n    // ... other game logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not block the main game
    loop. It performs its operations asynchronously if necessary, ensuring minimal
    impact on server performance during high-traffic periods.
