  brief: Determines whether the profession auction bridge feature is enabled for the
    specified player.
  description: The IsEnabled method checks if the profession auction bridge functionality
    is active for a given player. This feature typically allows players to list their
    crafted items on the auction house directly from their profession interfaces.
    The method takes an optional player identifier and returns a boolean value indicating
    the status of the feature. It's commonly used in conjunction with other auction
    house or crafting system functions to control access to specialized auction mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object or player identifier. If null, the method
      may check for a default or current player context.
  returns: Returns true if the profession auction bridge feature is enabled for the
    specified player; otherwise returns false.
  examples:

  - title: Conditional Auction Listing

    during gameplay, so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
