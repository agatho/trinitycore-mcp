  class: PositionManager
  method: TrackPerformance
  signature: void PositionManager::TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds duration,
    const std::string & operation)
documentation:
  brief: Records performance metrics for position-related operations in the game world.
  description: The TrackPerformance method logs timing information for various position
    management operations within the TrinityCore framework. It is designed to monitor
    and analyze the efficiency of position calculations, updates, or transformations
    that occur during gameplay. This functionality supports performance debugging
    and optimization by collecting duration data for specific operations. The method
    typically integrates with internal profiling systems to maintain a record of operation
    times, which can be used for identifying bottlenecks in movement handling or spatial
    queries.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The time taken to complete the operation, measured in microseconds.
      This value represents the actual execution time of the tracked operation.
  - name: operation
    description: A descriptive string identifying the type of position-related operation
      being tracked. Common values might include 'UpdatePosition', 'CalculateDistance',
      or 'ValidateMovement'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // Perform some position calculation

      ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::microseconds duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start);

      positionManager.TrackPerformance(duration, "CalculateDistance");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the PositionManager class to gather
    performance data for profiling purposes. It may store metrics in an internal buffer
    or send them to a logging system. The operation string should be kept consistent
    across similar operations to enable meaningful aggregation and analysis.
