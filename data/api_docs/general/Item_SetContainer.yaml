  method: SetContainer
  signature: void Item::SetContainer(Bag * container)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the container for an item to a specified bag.
  description: This method assigns a bag object to an item, establishing the relationship
    between the item and its container. It is commonly used during item creation or
    when moving items between containers. The method updates internal references within
    the item's data structure to reflect the new container relationship. This operation
    typically occurs during item initialization or when changing item ownership.
  parameters:
  - name: container
    description: A pointer to the Bag object that will serve as the container for
      this item. Must be a valid bag object or nullptr.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item;

      Bag* bag = new Bag;

      item->SetContainer(bag);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Complete example with validation
    code: "Item* item = new Item;\nBag* bag = nullptr;\nif (bag != nullptr) {\n  \
      \  item->SetContainer(bag);\n}\nelse {\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method updates internal data structures to reflect the container relationship.
    It is typically called during item initialization or when changing item ownership.
    Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls if the item already
    has a container assigned.
  warnings: Care should be taken when calling this method on items that are already
    in use, as it may cause memory leaks or incorrect data references if not handled
    properly. Avoid calling this method with nullptr for container parameter unless
    explicitly required.
