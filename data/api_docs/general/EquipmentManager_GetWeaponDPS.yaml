  signature: float EquipmentManager::GetWeaponDPS(int * item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the damage per second (DPS) value for a specified
    weapon item.
  description: The GetWeaponDPS method computes the average damage per second that
    a player's weapon will deal based on its item information, including weapon speed,
    minimum and maximum damage values, and any applicable enchantments or bonuses.
    This calculation is essential for determining combat effectiveness and is used
    in various gameplay mechanics such as damage calculations, stat displays, and
    performance comparisons. The method requires a valid item pointer to retrieve
    the necessary weapon data from the game's item database. It accounts for different
    weapon types, their inherent properties, and any temporary modifications that
    may affect DPS.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to an Item object representing the weapon whose DPS is to
      be calculated. Must not be null and must point to a valid equipped weapon item.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated damage per second (DPS)
    for the specified weapon. A return value of 0.0 indicates either an invalid item
    or a non-weapon item was passed. The DPS value accounts for weapon speed, damage
    range, and any relevant modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate DPS for Main Hand Weapon
    code: "Item* mainHand = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND);\n\
      float dps = equipmentManager->GetWeaponDPS(mainHand);\nif (dps > 0.0f)\n{\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Main hand weapon DPS: \" << dps << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Compare DPS of Two Weapons
    code: "Item* weapon1 = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND);\n\
      Item* weapon2 = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, EQUIPMENT_SLOT_OFFHAND);\n\
      float dps1 = equipmentManager->GetWeaponDPS(weapon1);\nfloat dps2 = equipmentManager->GetWeaponDPS(weapon2);\n\
      if (dps1 > dps2)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Main hand weapon has higher DPS\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}\nelse if (dps2 > dps1)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Off-hand weapon\
      \ has higher DPS\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally uses the item's weapon speed and damage range to compute
    DPS. It may be affected by temporary buffs, debuffs, or enchantments that modify
    weapon properties. The calculation does not account for player-specific stats
    like attack power or critical strike chance, which are handled separately in combat
    calculations.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid item (non-weapon) to this method
    will result in undefined behavior or incorrect DPS values. Always validate the
    item before calling this method. The returned DPS value is calculated at the time
    of call and may change if weapon properties are modified during gameplay.
