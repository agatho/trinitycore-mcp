documentation:
  brief: Attempts to retrieve follow parameters from a movement request.
  description: The TryGetFollowParams method is used to extract and validate follow-related
    parameters from a MovementRequest object. This method typically checks if the
    request contains valid data for a follow action, such as target GUID, distance,
    and orientation settings. It returns an integer status code indicating success
    or failure of the parameter retrieval operation. The method is commonly used in
    AI behavior systems where creatures need to follow players or other units with
    specific parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer status code: 0 if parameters were successfully retrieved
    and are valid, non-zero value (typically -1) if parameters could not be retrieved
    or are invalid. The exact meaning of non-zero values may depend on implementation
    details within the TrinityCore framework.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (movementRequest.TryGetFollowParams() == 0)\n{\n    // Parameters successfully\
      \ retrieved, proceed with follow logic\n    // Use retrieved parameters to set\
      \ up creature following\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error handling for invalid movement requests
    code: "int result = movementRequest.TryGetFollowParams();\nif (result != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Handle invalid or missing follow parameters\n    // Log error or fallback\
      \ to default behavior\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to retrieve follow parameters\
      \ from movement request\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement handling system in TrinityCore and is
    typically called during AI update cycles. The method may perform validation checks
    on retrieved parameters to ensure they meet expected ranges or constraints. It's
    designed to be safe for concurrent access but should not be relied upon for critical
    path operations without proper error checking.
  warnings: This method does not modify the MovementRequest object itself, but it
    may internally validate or cache parameter data. If used in performance-critical
    sections, consider caching results to avoid repeated calls. The return value should
    always be checked as the method may fail silently under certain conditions.
