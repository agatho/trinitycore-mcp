  signature: void InterruptManager::ManageInterruptCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Manages and updates the cooldown timers for interrupt abilities within the
    game world.
  description: The ManageInterruptCooldowns method is responsible for handling the
    internal logic that governs when interrupt abilities can be used again after being
    activated. This includes checking if a cooldown has expired, updating the cooldown
    state, and ensuring that players cannot use interrupts before their respective
    cooldown periods have completed. The method typically runs on a periodic basis
    as part of the game's update loop to maintain synchronization between the player's
    ability state and the server-side cooldown tracking system.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void WorldSession::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other update logic...\n\
      \    _interruptManager.ManageInterruptCooldowns();\n    // Other update logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the game's main update loop or
    a dedicated cooldown management system. It should be invoked regularly to ensure
    accurate tracking of interrupt ability cooldowns across all active players and
    creatures in the world.
