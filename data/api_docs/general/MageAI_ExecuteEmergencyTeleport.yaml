  brief: Executes an emergency teleportation ability for a Mage AI unit
  description: The ExecuteEmergencyTeleport method performs a special teleportation
    action for a Mage AI unit, typically used during combat situations to reposition
    the mage away from danger or to escape from an unfavorable situation. This method
    is part of the Mage's AI behavior system and is designed to provide strategic
    mobility in response to critical threats. The implementation likely involves checking
    for valid teleportation targets, ensuring the mage has sufficient mana, and executing
    the actual teleportation mechanics within the game world.

  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void MyMageAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_shouldTeleport)\n\
      \    {\n        ExecuteEmergencyTeleport();\n        m_shouldTeleport = false;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the Mage AI system when specific
    combat conditions are met. It may involve checking for spell cooldowns, mana availability,
    and valid teleportation destinations within the game world. The implementation
    should be thread-safe as it's part of the AI update loop.
  warnings: Ensure that the Mage AI unit is in a valid state before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes. The method may fail silently if conditions
    for teleportation are not met, so proper error handling should be implemented
    by the caller.
