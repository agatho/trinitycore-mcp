  class: WarriorAI
  method: OptimizeHeroicLeapTiming
  signature: void WarriorAI::OptimizeHeroicLeapTiming()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the timing of Heroic Leap ability usage for the warrior AI.
  description: The OptimizeHeroicLeapTiming method adjusts the internal logic of the
    WarriorAI to determine the most effective time to use the Heroic Leap ability.
    This optimization considers factors such as target position, distance, cooldown
    status, and combat context to maximize the ability's impact. The method is typically
    called during AI decision-making cycles to ensure that Heroic Leap is used at
    optimal moments for damage output or positioning. It does not directly execute
    the ability but prepares the AI state for its proper timing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    OptimizeHeroicLeapTiming();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the warrior's combat decision-making process and should
    be called regularly during the AI update cycle. It modifies internal state variables
    that affect when Heroic Leap will be executed next, but does not directly trigger
    the spell.
  warnings: Ensure this method is not called excessively in tight loops as it may
    cause unnecessary computation. The optimization relies on current target data,
    so calling it without a valid target may lead to suboptimal behavior.
