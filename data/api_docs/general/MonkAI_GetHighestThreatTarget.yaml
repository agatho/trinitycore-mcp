  class: MonkAI
  method: GetHighestThreatTarget
  signature: int * MonkAI::GetHighestThreatTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the target with the highest threat level in the MonkAI's
    current threat list.
  description: The GetHighestThreatTarget method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the player or creature that currently holds the highest threat level within
    the MonkAI's threat table. This is a core function used by the AI to determine
    which target should be prioritized for attacks, especially in situations involving
    multiple enemies. The method operates on the internal threat management system
    of the MonkAI class and returns a pointer to an integer representing the GUID.
    It is typically invoked during combat decision-making processes to ensure that
    the monk focuses its attacks on the most dangerous or threatening opponent. The
    returned value can be NULL if no valid targets exist in the threat list, indicating
    that the AI has no current threat targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the highest threat target.
    Returns NULL if there are no valid targets in the threat list.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat decision logic
    code: "if (int* targetGuid = ai->GetHighestThreatTarget()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ attack on the highest threat target\n    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me,\
      \ *targetGuid);\n    if (target && target->IsAlive()) {\n        me->Attack(target,\
      \ true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal threat management system of the MonkAI.
    The returned pointer is only valid while the threat list remains unchanged and
    should not be stored for later use without proper validation. The method assumes
    that threat levels are updated regularly through combat events.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be NULL if no targets exist in the threat list,
    so always check for null before dereferencing. Using the returned GUID directly
    without validating the target's existence can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
