documentation:
  brief: Sets the initial health value for the unit during creation.
  description: The SetCreateHealth method configures the base health value that will
    be assigned to a Unit when it is created in the world. This value is typically
    used for NPCs and creatures to define their starting health pool. The method directly
    modifies an internal member variable that stores the create health value, which
    is then utilized during the unit's initialization process. This setting affects
    how much health the unit has upon spawning and can be crucial for balancing encounters
    or defining creature types.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting NPC Health on Creation
    code: 'Creature* npc = (Creature*)player->SummonCreature(12345, position, TEMPSUMMON_MANUAL_DESPAWN);

      npc->SetCreateHealth(1000);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before the unit is added to the world or spawned.
    Modifying this value after a unit has been initialized may not have any effect
    on its current health, only future spawns.
  warnings: Setting extremely high values may cause performance issues or client-side
    display problems. Ensure that the health value is within reasonable bounds for
    the intended creature type.
