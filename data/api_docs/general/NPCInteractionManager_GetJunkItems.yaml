  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: GetJunkItems
  signature: int NPCInteractionManager::GetJunkItems() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of junk items in the NPC's inventory.
  description: The GetJunkItems method returns the number of junk items currently
    stored in the NPC's inventory. This functionality is typically used during NPC
    interaction sessions to determine how many low-value or unusable items are available
    for sale or disposal. The method does not modify any state and provides a read-only
    count of items classified as junk within the NPC's trading inventory.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of junk items found in the NPC's
    inventory. Returns zero if no junk items are present or if the NPC has no inventory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int junkCount = interactionManager.GetJunkItems();\nif (junkCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Process junk items\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << junkCount << \"\
      \ junk items.\"\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Inventory Management Check
    code: "NPCInteractionManager* manager = player->GetNPCInteractionManager();\n\
      int junkItems = manager->GetJunkItems();\nif (junkItems > 0)\n{\n    // Notify\
      \ player about available junk items\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have\
      \ %d junk items available for sale.\", junkItems);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the NPC's inventory has already been initialized
    and populated with items. It relies on internal item classification logic to determine
    what constitutes a 'junk' item, which typically includes items below a certain
    quality threshold or those not useful for player progression.
  warnings: Ensure that the NPCInteractionManager instance is valid before calling
    this method, as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    The returned count may change between calls if the inventory is modified by other
    systems during gameplay.
