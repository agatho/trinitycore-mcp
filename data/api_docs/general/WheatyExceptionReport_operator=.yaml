  brief: Moves the exception report data from a source object to this object
  description: The move assignment operator for WheatyExceptionReport transfers all
    resources and data from another WheatyExceptionReport instance to the current
    instance. This operation is typically used when you want to efficiently transfer
    ownership of exception reporting data without performing expensive deep copies.
    The source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after the move operation.
    In the context of TrinityCore's crash handling and debugging infrastructure, this
    method allows for efficient management of exception report objects during error
    conditions or crash dumps.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current WheatyExceptionReport instance, allowing for
    chaining of assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic move assignment usage
    code: 'WheatyExceptionReport report1;

      // ... populate report1 with exception data ...

      WheatyExceptionReport report2 = std::move(report1); // Uses move assignment

      // report1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining move assignments
    code: 'WheatyExceptionReport report1, report2, report3;

      // ... populate reports with data ...

      report1 = std::move(report2) = std::move(report3); // Chained move assignments

      // report2 and report3 are left in valid but unspecified states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move assignment operator, not a copy assignment. It's designed
    to be efficient by transferring ownership of resources rather than copying them.
    The implementation typically involves swapping internal pointers or handles between
    objects. In TrinityCore's crash reporting system, this allows for efficient handling
    of exception reports during server crashes or debugging scenarios.
  warnings: After calling move assignment, the source object should not be used in
    any way that might access its data, as it will be left in a valid but unspecified
    state. This is different from copy semantics where both objects remain valid and
    independent.
