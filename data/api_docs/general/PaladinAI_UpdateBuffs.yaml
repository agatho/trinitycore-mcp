documentation:
  brief: Updates the Paladin AI's buff states and applies appropriate buffs based
    on current combat situation.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method in PaladinAI is responsible for managing and
    applying buffs to the paladin character during gameplay. This method evaluates
    the current state of the paladin, including health, mana, combat status, and nearby
    allies or enemies, to determine which buffs should be active. It typically handles
    the logic for maintaining key paladin abilities such as Divine Shield, Blessing
    of Might, and other defensive or offensive auras. The method is called periodically
    by the AI system to ensure optimal buff usage during combat encounters.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void PaladinAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the paladin's AI update cycle
    and should not be called manually unless implementing custom behavior. The method
    relies on internal state tracking of the paladin's health, mana, and target status
    to make decisions about buff application.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the AI update context as it may cause
    inconsistent buff states or unexpected behavior in combat scenarios.
