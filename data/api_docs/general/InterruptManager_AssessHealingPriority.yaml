  class: InterruptManager
  method: AssessHealingPriority
  signature: InterruptPriority InterruptManager::AssessHealingPriority(const SpellInfo
    * spellInfo, Unit * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the priority level for interrupting healing spells
    based on spell information and caster.
  description: The AssessHealingPriority method determines the interrupt priority
    of a healing spell by analyzing the provided SpellInfo and Unit caster. This function
    is used within the TrinityCore's spell interruption system to decide whether a
    healing spell should be interrupted, and at what priority level. The method evaluates
    factors such as spell type, caster's state, and potential threat or damage caused
    by the healing action. It plays a critical role in managing combat flow and ensuring
    proper spell interaction during encounters with hostile targets.
  parameters:
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the spell being evaluated. Must not be null.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit that is casting the spell. Must not be null and
      must represent a valid game entity.
  returns: Returns an InterruptPriority enum value indicating how urgently the healing
    spell should be interrupted. Possible values include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL
    depending on the evaluation criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell interruption logic
    code: "InterruptPriority priority = interruptManager.AssessHealingPriority(spellInfo,\
      \ caster);\nif (priority >= InterruptPriority::HIGH) {\n    // Interrupt the\
      \ healing spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to determine combat response
    code: "InterruptPriority priority = interruptManager.AssessHealingPriority(spellInfo,\
      \ caster);\nswitch (priority) {\n    case InterruptPriority::LOW:\n        //\
      \ Allow healing to proceed\n        break;\n    case InterruptPriority::HIGH:\n\
      \        // Initiate interrupt sequence\n        break;\n    default:\n    \
      \    // Default behavior\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell interruption system and relies on internal
    game state evaluation. It may be called frequently during combat, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account when extending or modifying its logic.
    The method assumes valid inputs and does not perform null checks internally.
  warnings: Ensure that both spellInfo and caster parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method; passing null values can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    This function is typically used in interrupt handling contexts, so improper use
    may affect combat balance or game stability.
