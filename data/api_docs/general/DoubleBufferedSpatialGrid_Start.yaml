  signature: void DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::Start()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the double-buffered spatial grid system for efficient object
    management and spatial queries.
  description: The Start method initializes the internal state of the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
    class, preparing it for use in managing game objects within a spatial grid structure.
    This method typically sets up the necessary data structures, allocates memory,
    and configures the grid's parameters such as cell size and dimensions. It is essential
    to call this method before any other operations on the grid can be performed.
    The double-buffering mechanism allows for concurrent read and write operations
    by maintaining two separate grids, enabling smooth updates without blocking spatial
    queries during object movement or addition/removal.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
    code: 'DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid grid;

      gird.Start(); // Initialize the grid for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
    instance. Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    initialization process is typically lightweight but depends on the configured
    grid size and cell count.
