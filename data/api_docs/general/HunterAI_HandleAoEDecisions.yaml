documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and selects optimal AoE target for hunter's area of effect abilities.
  description: The HandleAoEDecisions method is responsible for determining the most
    effective target for area of effect spells or abilities within the HunterAI class.
    This method analyzes the current combat environment, including enemy positions,
    threat levels, and spell effectiveness, to select an optimal target that maximizes
    damage output or utility. It typically operates during the AI's decision-making
    cycle when AoE abilities are available and relevant. The method returns true if
    a suitable target was identified and processed, false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for hunters utilizing abilities like Multi-Shot, Volley, or other AoE
    attacks in both PvE and PvP scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid AoE target was successfully selected and processed;
    returns false if no suitable target could be found or if the decision-making process
    failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (HandleAoEDecisions(nullptr))\n\
      \    {\n        // AoE target selected, proceed with ability casting\n     \
      \   DoCastVictim(AbilitySpellId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle and may interact
    with the hunter's current target selection logic. It assumes that the hunter has
    access to appropriate AoE spells and that the environment supports effective area
    targeting. The method does not directly cast spells but rather determines the
    best target for such actions.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the hunter is in combat and has
    available AoE abilities. Calling it outside of combat or without proper spell
    availability may result in incorrect behavior or failed targeting decisions.
