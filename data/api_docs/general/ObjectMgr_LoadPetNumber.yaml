documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads pet number tracking for creature entries in the database.
  description: The LoadPetNumber method is responsible for initializing the pet number
    system within the ObjectMgr class. It reads and processes pet-related data from
    the database, specifically focusing on creature entries that are designated as
    pets. This method ensures that each pet creature has a unique identifier assigned
    to it, which is crucial for maintaining proper pet tracking and management in
    the game world. The method typically executes during server startup or when loading
    creature data, establishing the foundation for pet-related functionality such
    as summoning, ownership tracking, and pet behavior management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadObjectMgr()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadPetNumber();\n    //\
      \ Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization phase and should
    not be invoked repeatedly. It's part of the internal data loading mechanism and
    directly interacts with the database to fetch pet-related creature entries. The
    method assumes that the database connection is already established and that the
    relevant tables contain valid pet data.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you understand its internal workings
    and dependencies. Invoking it outside of the proper initialization sequence may
    lead to inconsistent state or data corruption. This method should only be called
    once during server startup as part of the standard loading process.
