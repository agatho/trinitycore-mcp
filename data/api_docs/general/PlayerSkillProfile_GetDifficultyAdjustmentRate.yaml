documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the difficulty adjustment rate applied to player skills.
  description: The GetDifficultyAdjustmentRate method retrieves a floating-point value
    that represents the current difficulty scaling factor applied to player skill
    progression. This value is used internally by TrinityCore to adjust skill gains
    based on player level, server settings, and game difficulty modes. The returned
    rate typically ranges from 0.0 to 2.0, where 1.0 indicates normal difficulty scaling,
    values below 1.0 reduce skill gains, and values above 1.0 increase them. This
    method does not modify any internal state and is read-only.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current difficulty adjustment rate. Typical
    values range from 0.0 (no skill gain) to 2.0 (double skill gain), with 1.0 indicating
    normal difficulty scaling.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float difficultyRate = player->GetSkillProfile()->GetDifficultyAdjustmentRate();\n\
      if (difficultyRate > 1.0f)\n{\n    // Player is gaining skills at an increased\
      \ rate\n    sLog->outString(\"Player skill gain multiplier: %.2f\", difficultyRate);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Skill Gain Calculation
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* profile = player->GetSkillProfile();

      float baseGain = 10.0f;

      float adjustedGain = baseGain * profile->GetDifficultyAdjustmentRate();

      player->AddSkillPoints(SKILL_FIRST_AID, adjustedGain);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during skill gain calculations and may be
    affected by server configuration settings such as 'Rate.Skill' or difficulty mode
    modifiers. The value returned might change dynamically based on in-game events
    or player conditions.
  warnings: The returned value should not be modified directly as it's computed from
    multiple factors including server settings, player level, and game mode. Direct
    modification of this rate could lead to inconsistent skill progression behavior.
