  class: AuctionHouse
  method: GetPriceHistory
  signature: float AuctionHouse::GetPriceHistory(uint32 itemId, uint32 days)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average price of an item over a specified number
    of days from the auction house history.
  description: The GetPriceHistory method retrieves historical pricing data for a
    specific item within the auction house system. It computes the average price of
    the given item over the last specified number of days, which can be useful for
    determining market trends or setting realistic bid prices. This method is typically
    used by game systems or scripts that need to analyze auction dynamics and item
    valuation. The implementation likely accesses internal auction house databases
    or caches to retrieve historical transaction data. It may not include items that
    have not been sold recently or are currently listed, depending on the underlying
    data model.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which price history is requested.
      This corresponds to the ItemTemplate entry ID in the database.
  - name: days
    description: The number of days of historical data to consider when calculating
      the average price. Must be a positive integer value representing the time window.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the average price of the specified item
    over the given number of days. If no historical data is available for the item
    or the requested period, it may return 0.0 or a default value indicating insufficient
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate Average Price for a Common Item
    code: float avgPrice = auctionHouse->GetPriceHistory(12345, 7); // Get average
      price for item ID 12345 over the last 7 days
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine Market Trend for Rare Item
    code: "uint32 rareItemId = 98765;\nfloat weeklyAvg = auctionHouse->GetPriceHistory(rareItemId,\
      \ 7);\nfloat monthlyAvg = auctionHouse->GetPriceHistory(rareItemId, 30);\nif\
      \ (weeklyAvg > monthlyAvg) {\n    // Item price is trending upward\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses cached or database-stored auction transaction
    records. Performance may be impacted if called frequently with many different
    item IDs or large time windows. The returned value represents an average and does
    not account for market fluctuations beyond the specified period.
  warnings: The method might return inaccurate results if the auction house data is
    not fully synchronized or if there are insufficient transactions for the requested
    item within the specified timeframe. Always validate that the returned price is
    reasonable before using it in gameplay logic.
