  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool AdvancedBehaviorManager::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the advanced behavior manager is currently enabled.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the AdvancedBehaviorManager is active
    and processing behaviors. This flag typically controls whether custom AI logic,
    scripted actions, or enhanced behavior patterns are executed within the game world.
    The method performs a simple boolean check on an internal state variable that
    can be modified through other manager methods or configuration settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AdvancedBehaviorManager is enabled and actively processing
    behaviors; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (behaviorManager.IsEnabled())\n{\n    // Perform actions only when behavior\
      \ manager is enabled\n    player->Say(\"Advanced behaviors are active.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Behavior Execution
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (behaviorManager.IsEnabled())\n\
      \    {\n        // Execute custom AI logic\n        DoCustomBehavior();\n  \
      \  }\n    else\n    {\n        // Fallback to default behavior\n        DoDefaultBehavior();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with Enable() and Disable()
    methods to control the lifecycle of advanced AI behaviors. It's recommended to
    cache the result of this method if it's called frequently within tight loops,
    as the check itself is lightweight but repeated calls may impact performance in
    high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method's return value for critical game
    logic, as enabling/disabling behavior managers should be handled carefully to
    avoid inconsistent states. Also, ensure that disabling the manager doesn't leave
    NPCs in an undefined state where they might not respond properly to player interactions.
