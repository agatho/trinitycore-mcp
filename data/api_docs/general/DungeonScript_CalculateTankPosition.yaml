  class: DungeonScript
  method: CalculateTankPosition
  signature: int DungeonScript::CalculateTankPosition(int * player, int * boss) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal tank position relative to the boss for
    dungeon encounters.
  description: The CalculateTankPosition method determines the appropriate positioning
    for a tank character during dungeon boss fights. It evaluates player and boss
    positions to compute an ideal tank placement that ensures proper threat management,
    aggro control, and encounter mechanics compliance. This method is typically used
    in scripted dungeon encounters where positioning is critical for successful completion.
    The calculation considers factors such as boss attack range, player movement capabilities,
    and encounter-specific requirements. The method operates on const data and does
    not modify internal state.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's current position
      or identifier within the dungeon context
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the boss's current position or
      identifier within the dungeon context
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal tank position.
    A positive value typically indicates a specific coordinate or offset, while zero
    or negative values may denote failure conditions or default positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon script
    code: "int playerPos = 100;\nint bossPos = 200;\nint tankPos = dungeonScript->CalculateTankPosition(&playerPos,\
      \ &bossPos);\nif (tankPos > 0) {\n    // Use calculated tank position\n    printf(\"\
      Optimal tank position: %d\\n\", tankPos);\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to calculate tank position\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with encounter management
    code: "class MyDungeonScript : public DungeonScript {\npublic:\n    int CalculateTankPosition(int*\
      \ player, int* boss) const override {\n        if (!player || !boss) return\
      \ -1;\n        \n        // Simple distance-based calculation\n        int distance\
      \ = *boss - *player;\n        int optimalPosition = *boss - (distance / 2);\n\
      \        \n        // Ensure position is within valid range\n        return\
      \ (optimalPosition > 0) ? optimalPosition : 1;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called during encounter initialization or positioning
    phases. The returned value should be interpreted in the context of the specific
    dungeon mechanics and may require additional processing for actual position assignment.
    The method assumes valid input parameters and does not perform bounds checking
    on pointers.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it's const, meaning it shouldn't modify
    object state, but the use of pointer parameters implies that the values pointed
    to might be modified externally. Ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded
    environments.
