documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new DungeonBehavior instance with default settings and configurations.
  description: The DungeonBehavior constructor initializes a new instance of the DungeonBehavior
    class, setting up internal state variables and configuration parameters required
    for dungeon-specific AI behavior. This method is typically called when creating
    a new dungeon encounter or when initializing the behavior system for a specific
    dungeon instance. The constructor ensures that all necessary data structures are
    properly allocated and initialized before the behavior logic can be executed.
    It may also register the behavior with the game's event system or initialize any
    required callbacks for dungeon-specific events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of DungeonBehavior
    code: 'DungeonBehavior* dungeonBehavior = new DungeonBehavior();

      // The constructor automatically initializes all internal state

      // and prepares the behavior for use in a dungeon encounter.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method, so it should only be called during object instantiation.
    The constructor performs initialization that may involve memory allocation and
    setup of internal data structures. It's important to ensure that any resources
    allocated by this constructor are properly cleaned up in the destructor.
