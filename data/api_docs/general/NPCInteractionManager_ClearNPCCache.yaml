documentation:
  brief: Clears the NPC interaction cache to remove all stored NPC data and reset
    the manager's internal state.
  description: The ClearNPCCache method is responsible for purging all cached NPC
    data from the NPCInteractionManager. This operation resets the internal cache
    structure, ensuring that subsequent interactions with NPCs will require fresh
    data retrieval. The method is typically invoked during player logout, zone changes,
    or when the system needs to refresh its NPC state. It ensures memory efficiency
    by removing stale references and prepares the manager for new interaction sessions.
    No parameters are required as the method operates on the manager's internal state
    exclusively.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Logout
    code: "void Player::OnLogout()\n{\n    sNPCInteractionManager->ClearNPCCache();\n\
      \    // Proceed with other logout procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage During Zone Change
    code: "void Player::OnAreaChanged()\n{\n    sNPCInteractionManager->ClearNPCCache();\n\
      \    // Reinitialize NPC interactions for new zone\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be safely called from any game thread.
    It does not perform any I/O operations, making it lightweight in terms of performance
    impact. The cache clearing process ensures that no dangling references remain
    after the operation.
  warnings: Calling this method during active NPC interactions may result in unexpected
    behavior or loss of interaction state. It should only be invoked when NPC interactions
    are not actively occurring to avoid data inconsistency issues.
