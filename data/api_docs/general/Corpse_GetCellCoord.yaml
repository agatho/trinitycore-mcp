documentation:
  brief: Returns the cell coordinate of the corpse's location in the game world.
  description: The GetCellCoord method retrieves the cell coordinate where the corpse
    is located. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, the game world is divided into
    cells for efficient management and rendering. This method provides access to the
    specific cell identifier that contains the corpse, which is useful for spatial
    queries, zone-based operations, or determining the corpse's proximity to other
    entities. The returned value represents a unique identifier for the grid cell
    within the map system. This method does not perform any calculations or lookups;
    it simply returns a cached value stored in the Corpse object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the cell coordinate of
    the corpse's location in the game world grid system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use corpse cell coordinate
    code: "Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized\nconst int& cellCoord\
      \ = corpse->GetCellCoord();\nif (cellCoord >= 0)\n{\n    // Use the cell coordinate\
      \ for spatial queries or logging\n    sLog->outString(\"Corpse located in cell\
      \ %d\", cellCoord);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The cell coordinate returned by this method is typically derived from the
    corpse's position and the map's grid system. It may be used for optimization purposes
    such as determining which players should see the corpse or managing memory usage
    in large zones. This value is set during corpse creation and remains constant
    throughout the corpse's lifetime.
