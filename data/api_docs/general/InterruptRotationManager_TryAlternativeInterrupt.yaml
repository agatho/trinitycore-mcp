documentation:
  brief: Attempts to find and execute an alternative interrupt ability if the current
    interrupt fails.
  description: The TryAlternativeInterrupt method is designed to handle cases where
    a primary interrupt ability fails or is not available. It evaluates whether there
    are other interrupt options available for the unit's current state and attempts
    to use one of them. This method is typically used in AI logic to ensure that interrupts
    are attempted even when the preferred option is unavailable. The method checks
    for valid alternative abilities, verifies their conditions, and executes them
    if possible. It returns true if an alternative interrupt was successfully executed,
    or false if no suitable alternative could be found or executed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if an alternative interrupt ability was successfully executed;
    otherwise returns false if no valid alternative interrupt could be found or executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (m_interruptManager->TryAlternativeInterrupt(target))\n{\n    // Alternative\
      \ interrupt was successful\n    m_ai->SetNextAction(ActionType::ATTACK);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // No alternative available, fallback to default behavior\n   \
      \ m_ai->SetNextAction(ActionType::FLEE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the interrupt rotation system and should be called
    within the context of an AI decision-making loop. It assumes that the unit has
    access to multiple interrupt abilities and that the target is valid for interruption.
    The method does not perform any direct combat actions itself, but rather selects
    and triggers another interrupt ability.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and that the unit has appropriate
    interrupt abilities available before calling this method. Calling this method
    without proper setup may result in no interrupt being executed or unexpected behavior.
