  signature: bool WarlockAI::HandlePetManagement()
documentation:
  brief: Manages pet behavior and actions for a warlock AI, returning true if management
    was successful.
  description: The HandlePetManagement method is responsible for controlling and coordinating
    the behavior of a warlock's summoned pet within the AI system. This method typically
    handles pet positioning, targeting, spell casting, and other tactical decisions
    related to the pet's actions during combat. It integrates with the broader WarlockAI
    framework to ensure that the pet acts in accordance with the warlock's current
    situation and strategy. The method evaluates the pet's current state, available
    abilities, and target conditions to determine appropriate actions. It may also
    handle pet summoning, dismissal, or repositioning based on combat dynamics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the pet management was successfully processed and the pet's
    behavior was updated accordingly; otherwise returns false if an error occurred
    during management or if no action was taken.
  examples:
  - title: Basic pet management call
    code: "if (warlockAI->HandlePetManagement()) {\n    // Pet management completed\
      \ successfully\n    // Continue with other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked regularly to maintain proper pet behavior. The implementation may vary
    based on the specific warlock specialization (Affliction, Demonology, Destruction)
    as each has different pet management strategies. It's important to note that this
    method might interact with other AI components such as target selection and spell
    casting.
  warnings: This method should not be called during critical sections where the pet
    state is being modified externally, as it may cause race conditions or inconsistent
    behavior. Also, ensure that the pet exists and is valid before calling this method
    to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
