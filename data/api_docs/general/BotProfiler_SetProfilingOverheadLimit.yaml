  class: BotProfiler
  method: SetProfilingOverheadLimit
  signature: void BotProfiler::SetProfilingOverheadLimit(double percent)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum allowed profiling overhead percentage for bot performance
    monitoring.
  description: The SetProfilingOverheadLimit method configures the threshold percentage
    that determines how much additional CPU time can be consumed by profiling operations
    relative to normal bot behavior. This limit helps prevent profiling from significantly
    impacting overall server performance and ensures that bot AI execution remains
    responsive. The value is typically expressed as a decimal between 0.0 and 100.0,
    where 0.0 disables profiling overhead entirely and higher values allow more profiling
    activity. This setting is crucial for maintaining game stability when running
    bots with extensive profiling enabled.
  parameters:
  - name: percent
    description: The maximum allowed profiling overhead as a percentage of normal
      bot execution time. Valid range is typically 0.0 to 100.0, where 0.0 disables
      profiling overhead monitoring and higher values permit more profiling activity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set profiling overhead limit to 5%
    code: BotProfiler::SetProfilingOverheadLimit(5.0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable profiling overhead monitoring
    code: BotProfiler::SetProfilingOverheadLimit(0.0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the internal profiling mechanism used by TrinityCore's
    bot AI system. Changes take effect immediately and may impact ongoing profiling
    sessions. The limit is enforced per bot instance and does not affect other server
    components.
  warnings: Setting this value too high may cause noticeable performance degradation
    in bot-controlled characters, especially during complex AI decision-making processes.
    Setting it to zero disables all profiling overhead checks which might be useful
    for debugging but can lead to unstable behavior under load.
