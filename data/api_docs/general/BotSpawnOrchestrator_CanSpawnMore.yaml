  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: CanSpawnMore
  signature: bool BotSpawnOrchestrator::CanSpawnMore() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether additional bot units can be spawned within the current
    spawn limits and constraints.
  description: The CanSpawnMore method evaluates the current state of the BotSpawnOrchestrator
    to determine if it is permissible to spawn another bot unit. This check typically
    considers factors such as maximum allowed bots per player, global spawn limits,
    resource availability, and server configuration settings. The method ensures that
    spawning new bots does not exceed defined thresholds or violate game mechanics
    rules. It is commonly used before initiating a bot spawn operation to prevent
    overpopulation or system overload.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if additional bots can be spawned according to current limits
    and constraints; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (orchestrator.CanSpawnMore()) {\n    // Proceed with spawning a new\
      \ bot\n    orchestrator.SpawnBot();\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no more\
      \ bots can be spawned\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"Cannot spawn additional bots\
      \ at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during bot management operations
    to enforce spawn rate limits and maintain server performance. It may involve checking
    internal counters, configuration values, and possibly database states depending
    on the implementation.
