documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BehaviorAdaptation instance with default settings.
  description: The BehaviorAdaptation constructor initializes a new instance of the
    BehaviorAdaptation class. This method sets up internal state variables and prepares
    the behavior adaptation system for use. It typically configures default parameters
    such as adaptation thresholds, learning rates, and behavior weights. The constructor
    ensures that all necessary data structures are properly allocated and initialized
    before the object can be used in AI decision-making processes within the TrinityCore
    framework.

  - title: Creating a new BehaviorAdaptation instance
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* adaptation = new BehaviorAdaptation();

      // The object is now ready for use in AI behavior management

      adaptation->SomeBehaviorMethod();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during AI module initialization or when
    creating new NPC behavior instances. It's important to note that while this method
    initializes the object, it does not automatically apply behavior adaptations -
    that requires explicit calls to adaptation methods.
