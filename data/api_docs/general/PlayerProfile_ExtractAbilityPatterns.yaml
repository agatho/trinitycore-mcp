documentation:
  brief: Extracts and processes ability patterns from the player's profile data for
    spell and talent analysis.
  description: The ExtractAbilityPatterns method analyzes the player's current ability
    set, including spells, talents, and passive abilities, to identify and categorize
    their active skill patterns. This method is typically invoked during profile evaluation
    or when generating character reports. It processes the player's known abilities
    and organizes them into structured data for further analysis or display purposes.
    The method does not modify the player's actual abilities but rather prepares them
    for consumption by other systems.

  - title: Basic usage in profile evaluation
    code: 'PlayerProfile* profile = player->GetPlayerProfile();

      profile->ExtractAbilityPatterns();

      // Ability patterns are now available for analysis'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    profile initialization or when ability data needs to be refreshed. It may involve
    performance considerations if called frequently on large ability sets.
