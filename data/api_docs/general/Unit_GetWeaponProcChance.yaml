  signature: float Unit::GetWeaponProcChance() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the chance for a weapon to proc during attack.
  description: The GetWeaponProcChance method retrieves the base probability that
    a weapon will trigger its proc effect when performing melee attacks. This value
    is influenced by factors such as weapon type, item level, and character stats.
    The method returns a float value representing the percentage chance of proc occurrence,
    which can be used in calculations for determining actual proc rates during combat.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with other weapon-related methods to determine
    overall weapon performance and proc mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the base proc chance percentage. Values
    range from 0.0 to 100.0, where 0.0 indicates no chance of proc and 100.0 indicates
    guaranteed proc. The actual proc chance may be modified by various factors including
    character stats, talents, and equipment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float procChance = unit->GetWeaponProcChance();\n\nif (procChance > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Weapon has a chance to proc\n    // Proceed with further calculations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method typically accesses internal weapon statistics
    and may involve calculations based on item level, weapon type, and character attributes.
    Performance considerations: The method is lightweight but may be called frequently
    during combat simulations. Thread safety: This method is thread-safe as it operates
    on const objects.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using this value without accounting for modifiers from
    talents or equipment. Dangerous edge cases: When the returned value is 0.0, which
    might indicate no proc chance or a bug in the calculation.'
