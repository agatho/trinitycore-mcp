  signature: uint32 CooldownStackingOptimizer::PredictBloodlustTiming() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the predicted timestamp when Bloodlust will expire
    for the associated unit.
  description: The PredictBloodlustTiming method determines the future time at which
    the Bloodlust buff, typically from items like Bloodlust Potions or abilities such
    as Heroism, is expected to end. This prediction takes into account the current
    state of the unit's cooldowns and any active effects that may influence the duration
    of the buff. It returns a Unix timestamp representing when the effect will expire,
    allowing for strategic planning in combat scenarios where timing is crucial. The
    method assumes that Bloodlust has already been applied and is currently active
    on the unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the Unix timestamp (in seconds since epoch)
    at which the Bloodlust effect is predicted to expire. If no Bloodlust effect is
    active, the return value may be 0 or a default time indicating no active buff.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 expirationTime = optimizer.PredictBloodlustTiming();\nif (expirationTime\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Bloodlust expires at: \" << expirationTime <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Combat Timing
    code: "uint32 bloodlustEnd = optimizer.PredictBloodlustTiming();\nuint32 currentTime\
      \ = time(nullptr);\nif (bloodlustEnd > currentTime)\n{\n    uint32 remainingSeconds\
      \ = bloodlustEnd - currentTime;\n    // Schedule next action based on remaining\
      \ duration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of active buffs and cooldowns.
    It should only be called when the unit is known to have an active Bloodlust effect.
    The returned timestamp reflects the predicted end time, which may vary slightly
    due to game mechanics or server-side adjustments.
  warnings: Ensure that the unit has an active Bloodlust effect before calling this
    method; otherwise, it may return incorrect or misleading values. This function
    does not account for external modifications to the buff duration such as those
    from certain talents or gear effects.
