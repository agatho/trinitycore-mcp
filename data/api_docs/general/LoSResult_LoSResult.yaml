documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LoSResult class, setting up default values
    for line-of-sight calculation results.
  description: The LoSResult constructor initializes a new instance of the LoSResult
    class, which is used to store and manage the outcome of line-of-sight (LoS) calculations
    within the TrinityCore framework. This class typically holds information about
    whether a direct path exists between two points in the game world, including details
    such as hit position, target object, and any obstacles encountered during the
    trace. The constructor sets default values for all internal members to ensure
    that subsequent LoS operations can be performed reliably without requiring explicit
    initialization of each member variable.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of LoSResult
    code: 'LoSResult result;

      // The result object is now initialized with default values

      // ready for use in line-of-sight calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore engine
    when performing line-of-sight checks. Developers should not need to explicitly
    instantiate LoSResult objects unless implementing custom LoS logic or debugging
    existing implementations.
