  method: Shutdown
  signature: void BotChatCommandHandler::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot chat command handler, terminating all active bot commands
    and cleaning up resources.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating the operation
    of the BotChatCommandHandler. It ensures that any ongoing bot commands are properly
    stopped, associated resources are released, and internal state is cleaned up.
    This method is typically invoked when the game server is shutting down or when
    the bot system needs to be disabled. The shutdown process may involve stopping
    active threads, closing connections, and notifying other systems about the impending
    termination of bot operations. It is designed to prevent resource leaks and ensure
    clean system state during termination.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      handler.Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the system is in a state where it's
    safe to terminate bot operations. It is not thread-safe and should be called from
    a single-threaded context to prevent race conditions during cleanup.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while bot commands are actively executing may result
    in abrupt termination of those commands, potentially leaving game state in an
    inconsistent condition. Always ensure all active bot operations are completed
    or properly suspended before invoking this method.
