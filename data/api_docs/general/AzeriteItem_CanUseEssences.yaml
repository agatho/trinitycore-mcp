  class: AzeriteItem
  method: CanUseEssences
  signature: bool AzeriteItem::CanUseEssences() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Azerite item can use essences for upgrading or modification.
  description: The CanUseEssences method checks if the current Azerite item is in
    a state where essences can be applied to it. This typically involves verifying
    that the item has available slots for essences, is not locked or bound in a way
    that prevents essence usage, and meets other game mechanics requirements such
    as being equipped or in a valid inventory location. The method returns true if
    all conditions are met for essence application, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for Azerite gear progression systems in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Azerite item can use essences (i.e., has available
    slots and meets all requirements for essence application), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Azerite item can use essences
    code: "if (azeriteItem->CanUseEssences()) {\n    // Proceed with essence application\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"Azerite item can accept essences\\n\");\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Handle case where essences cannot be applied\n    printf(\"Azerite item\
      \ cannot accept essences\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks on the item's state, such as whether it
    is equipped, has free essence slots, and is not in a restricted state (e.g., soulbound
    or locked). It may also consider the player's current Azerite tier or progression
    level to determine eligibility.
  warnings: Do not assume that an item can always use essences; always call this method
    before attempting to apply essences. Incorrect usage may lead to invalid operations
    or client/server desync issues.
