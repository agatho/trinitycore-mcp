  class: AvoidanceMetrics
  method: Reset
  signature: void AvoidanceMetrics::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all avoidance metrics to their initial state, clearing accumulated
    data for combat analysis.
  description: The Reset method clears all stored avoidance statistics within the
    AvoidanceMetrics class. This includes resetting counters for dodges, parries,
    blocks, and other defensive actions that have been tracked during combat. The
    method is typically invoked at the start of a new combat encounter or when resetting
    performance analysis data. It ensures that subsequent metric collection begins
    with clean state values, making it suitable for accurate combat analysis over
    defined time periods or encounters. No parameters are required as the method operates
    on internal class state only.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset metrics at start of combat
    code: "void OnCombatStart()\n{\n    avoidanceMetrics.Reset();\n    // Begin new\
      \ combat analysis with clean data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting new combat encounters to ensure
    accurate metric tracking. It does not affect the underlying combat system or player
    state, only the statistical tracking within the AvoidanceMetrics class.
