  class: Trigger
  method: GetTriggerCount
  signature: uint32 Trigger::GetTriggerCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of triggers associated with this trigger object.
  description: The GetTriggerCount method retrieves the total count of triggers linked
    to the current Trigger instance. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore server environment to determine how many trigger events or conditions
    are currently active or registered for a specific trigger object. The return value
    represents a numerical count that can be used for various game logic purposes,
    such as determining whether a trigger has been activated a certain number of times
    or managing trigger-based quest progressions. This method does not modify any
    state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of triggers associated with
    this Trigger object. Returns 0 if no triggers are currently registered or active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Trigger Count
    code: "Trigger* trigger = ...; // Assume this is a valid Trigger pointer\nuint32\
      \ count = trigger->GetTriggerCount();\nif (count > 0)\n{\n    // Process triggers\n\
      \    printf(\"Active triggers: %u\\n\", count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Trigger Count for Quest Progression
    code: "Trigger* questTrigger = player->GetQuestTrigger(12345);\nuint32 triggerCount\
      \ = questTrigger->GetTriggerCount();\nif (triggerCount >= 5)\n{\n    // Complete\
      \ quest\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not perform any locking operations. It
    should be used in contexts where trigger state information is needed without modifying
    the underlying trigger data structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the Trigger object is valid before calling this method, as
    calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The returned count
    may change between calls if triggers are dynamically added or removed during execution.
