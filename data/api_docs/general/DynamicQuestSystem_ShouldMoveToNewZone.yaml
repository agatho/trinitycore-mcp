  signature: bool DynamicQuestSystem::ShouldMoveToNewZone(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot player should move to a new zone based on dynamic
    quest system logic.
  description: The ShouldMoveToNewZone method evaluates if a bot player's current
    quest progression and location warrant moving to a different zone. This decision
    is typically made based on factors such as quest availability, zone requirements,
    and the bot's current quest state. The method integrates with the dynamic quest
    system to ensure optimal quest progression by suggesting zone transitions when
    beneficial. It considers the player's current zone, available quests in adjacent
    zones, and the bot's quest completion status before making a determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot should move to a new zone according to dynamic
    quest system rules; otherwise returns false if no zone transition is recommended
    or necessary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest management
    code: "if (dynamicQuestSystem->ShouldMoveToNewZone(bot)) {\n    bot->TeleportTo(newZoneMapId,\
      \ newX, newY, newZ, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with bot AI decision making
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateQuestLogic() {\n    if (dynamicQuestSystem->ShouldMoveToNewZone(bot))\
      \ {\n        MoveToNextQuestZone();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest state tracking and zone transition logic.
    It may be called frequently during bot operation, so performance optimization
    is recommended. The decision-making process considers both current quest completion
    status and future quest availability in adjacent zones.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null. Improper handling of the bot's quest state could lead to incorrect zone
    transition decisions or infinite loops in quest progression.
