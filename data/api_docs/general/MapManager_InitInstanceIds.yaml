documentation:
  brief: Initializes instance identifier tracking for maps within the MapManager.
  description: The InitInstanceIds method prepares the MapManager to handle unique
    instance identifiers for different map instances. This initialization is crucial
    for managing multiple copies of the same map, such as dungeon instances or raid
    encounters, ensuring each instance has a distinct identification number. The method
    typically sets up internal data structures that track available and used instance
    IDs, preventing conflicts when new instances are created. It's generally called
    during server startup or map loading processes to ensure proper instance ID allocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: MapManager::Instance()->InitInstanceIds();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. It's
    typically invoked automatically by the core system, but may also be called manually
    in specific scenarios involving dynamic map loading or reset operations.
