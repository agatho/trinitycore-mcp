  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: GetBracketForLevel
  signature: const LevelBracket * BotLevelDistribution::GetBracketForLevel(uint32
    level, int faction) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the level bracket corresponding to a specified player level and
    faction.
  description: The GetBracketForLevel method determines and returns the appropriate
    LevelBracket structure for a given player level and faction. This is used internally
    by the bot system to assign correct behavior, loot distribution, and difficulty
    scaling based on the player's level and faction. The method performs a lookup
    within the internal distribution tables and returns a pointer to the matching
    bracket. If no matching bracket is found, it may return a default or null value
    depending on implementation details. This method is essential for ensuring bots
    behave appropriately according to the player's progression and faction alignment.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The player's current level (1-80). Used to determine which bracket
      applies based on predefined level ranges.
  - name: faction
    description: The player's faction ID (e.g., 35, 469 for Alliance and Horde respectively).
      Determines faction-specific bracket behavior if applicable.
  returns: A pointer to a const LevelBracket structure that matches the provided level
    and faction. Returns nullptr if no matching bracket is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get a level bracket for an Alliance player at level 30
    code: "const LevelBracket* bracket = botLevelDistribution->GetBracketForLevel(30,\
      \ 469);\nif (bracket)\n{\n    // Use the bracket data\n    printf(\"Bracket\
      \ min level: %u\\n\", bracket->minLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the returned bracket to determine bot behavior
    code: "uint32 playerLevel = 45;\nint playerFaction = 35; // Horde\nconst LevelBracket*\
      \ bracket = botLevelDistribution->GetBracketForLevel(playerLevel, playerFaction);\n\
      if (bracket)\n{\n    // Adjust bot difficulty based on bracket\n    bot->SetDifficulty(bracket->difficulty);\n\
      \    bot->SetLootThreshold(bracket->lootThreshold);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal LevelBracket data structures are properly
    initialized and populated. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the BotLevelDistribution
    object remains alive. It's recommended to check for null returns before using
    the result.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned LevelBracket structure directly, as it may
    be shared or cached. Always treat the returned pointer as read-only. Improper
    handling of null returns can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
