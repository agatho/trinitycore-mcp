documentation:
  brief: Converts an InstanceEvent object into a human-readable string representation
  description: The ToString method provides a textual representation of an InstanceEvent
    object, typically used for debugging, logging, or displaying event information
    in a readable format. This method is commonly employed in TrinityCore's instance
    management system to serialize event data for monitoring purposes or to generate
    informative messages about ongoing instance events. The output string usually
    includes key identifiers such as the event ID, associated instance map, and potentially
    status information. No specific preconditions are required for calling this method,
    and it is generally safe to invoke from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the InstanceEvent
    object, typically including identifying information such as event ID, instance
    map ID, and status details
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Logging
    code: 'InstanceEvent event;

      // Assume event is initialized with data

      std::string eventString = event.ToString();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Current event: %s", eventString.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Instance Events
    code: "void DebugInstanceEvents(Player* player)\n{\n    for (auto& event : sInstanceSaveMgr->GetAllInstanceEvents())\n\
      \    {\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Event: %s\", event.ToString().c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for development and debugging purposes.
    The exact format of the returned string may vary depending on implementation details
    within TrinityCore's instance event system. It should not be relied upon for programmatic
    parsing as the format might change between versions.
  warnings: Avoid using the return value for critical game logic decisions, as it
    is designed for informational purposes only. The method does not perform any validation
    or error handling beyond basic string formatting.
