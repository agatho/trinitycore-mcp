documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all valid target candidates based on the provided selection context
    for AI decision making.
  description: 'The GetAllTargetCandidates method evaluates the current selection
    context and returns a list of all eligible targets that meet the criteria defined
    by the AI logic. This method is typically used in combat AI systems to determine
    which entities are valid options for attacks, spells, or other actions. It performs
    filtering based on factors such as target type, distance, health status, and faction
    relationships. The method does not modify any internal state but instead provides
    a read-only view of potential targets within the context''s scope. Precondition:
    The SelectionContext must be properly initialized with valid parameters including
    target type filters and range constraints.'
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of valid target candidates found. A
    return value of zero indicates no suitable targets were identified, while a positive
    integer signifies the count of available targets that can be selected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "int candidateCount = selector.GetAllTargetCandidates(context);\nif (candidateCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with target selection logic\n    Target* selectedTarget\
      \ = GetNextTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Multiple Targets
    code: "int count = selector.GetAllTargetCandidates(context);\nfor (int i = 0;\
      \ i < count; ++i)\n{\n    Target* target = GetTargetByIndex(i);\n    if (target\
      \ && target->IsAlive())\n    {\n        // Apply logic to valid targets\n  \
      \      ProcessAttack(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve performance-intensive operations when dealing with
    large numbers of potential targets. It's recommended to cache results or limit
    the scope of context parameters to optimize AI decision-making speed. The returned
    target list is not guaranteed to be sorted, so additional sorting logic might
    be required depending on the AI's selection strategy.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initializing the SelectionContext
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect filtering results. Always verify that
    context parameters such as range limits and target type filters are set appropriately
    before invoking this method.
