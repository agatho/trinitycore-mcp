  class: RoleAssignment
  method: OptimizeRoleDistribution
  signature: void RoleAssignment::OptimizeRoleDistribution(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes role distribution within a group based on player class, specialization,
    and encounter requirements.
  description: The OptimizeRoleDistribution method analyzes the current composition
    of a group and redistributes roles (tank, healer, damage dealer) to ensure optimal
    performance for the intended encounter. This method evaluates each group member's
    class, specialization, and gear to assign appropriate roles that maximize the
    group's effectiveness. It is typically invoked when a group is formed or when
    significant changes occur in group composition, such as players joining or leaving.
    The method ensures that roles are distributed fairly and efficiently across the
    group members.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    RoleAssignment\
      \ roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.OptimizeRoleDistribution(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in group-based content such as raids and dungeons
    where optimal role distribution significantly impacts success rates. The optimization
    algorithm considers class-specific roles, player levels, and gear quality to determine
    the best assignments.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group with insufficient members may result in
    suboptimal role assignments. Ensure that the group has enough players for all
    required roles before invoking this function.
