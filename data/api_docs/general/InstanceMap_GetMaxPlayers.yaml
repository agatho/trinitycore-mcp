  method: GetMaxPlayers
  signature: uint32 InstanceMap::GetMaxPlayers() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of players allowed in the instance map.
  description: The GetMaxPlayers method retrieves the configured maximum player limit
    for an instance map. This value is typically defined in the map's configuration
    or template and determines how many players can simultaneously be present in the
    instance. The returned value is used by the game engine to enforce instance size
    limits, manage group joining behavior, and control resource allocation for the
    specific instance type. This method does not account for any temporary restrictions
    or dynamic modifications that might occur during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of players allowed in this
    instance map. This value is typically set during map initialization and corresponds
    to the instance's difficulty settings or predefined limits.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InstanceMap* instance = player->GetInstanceMap();

      uint32 maxPlayers = instance->GetMaxPlayers();

      TC_LOG_INFO("player", "This instance allows up to %u players.", maxPlayers);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Instance Capacity
    code: "InstanceMap* map = player->GetInstanceMap();\nif (map)\n{\n    uint32 currentPlayers\
      \ = map->GetPlayersCount();\n    uint32 maxPlayers = map->GetMaxPlayers();\n\
      \    if (currentPlayers >= maxPlayers)\n    {\n        // Instance is full,\
      \ prevent further entry\n        player->SendSystemMessage(\"This instance is\
      \ currently full.\");\n        return;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned value represents the static maximum capacity of the instance
    and does not change during runtime unless the instance template or configuration
    is modified. This method is thread-safe as it only reads from immutable configuration
    data.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player can enter an instance,
    as other factors such as group composition, raid difficulty, and instance locks
    may also affect entry. The value returned does not include any temporary modifications
    or dynamic restrictions that might be applied during runtime.
