documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player's pet
  description: The GetPetGUID method retrieves the GUID of the player's current pet,
    which is a unique identifier used to distinguish between different pets in the
    game world. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft client-server communication
    and is essential for identifying pet objects within the TrinityCore framework.
    The GUID returned represents the pet's identity in the game world, allowing developers
    to access pet-specific data such as stats, behavior, or ownership. This method
    does not require any parameters and returns a valid GUID when called on a player
    with an active pet.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the player's pet. The GUID
    is a unique identifier used to distinguish between different pets in the game
    world, typically following the format of a 64-bit integer value that identifies
    the pet object uniquely within the server environment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = player->GetPet();\nif (unit)\n{\n    int petGUID = unit->GetPetGUID();\n\
      \    // Use petGUID to access pet-specific data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and is typically used in conjunction
    with other pet-related methods. The GUID returned by this method should be treated
    as a constant value during the lifetime of the pet, as it does not change unless
    the pet is dismissed or summoned. Performance considerations include that this
    method is relatively lightweight but may involve server-side processing if used
    frequently.
  warnings: This method should only be called on units that have pets; calling it
    on units without pets will result in an invalid GUID value. Additionally, developers
    must ensure that the unit object is valid before calling this method to avoid
    potential crashes or undefined behavior.
