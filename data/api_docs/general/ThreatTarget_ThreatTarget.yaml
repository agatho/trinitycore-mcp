documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ThreatTarget object with default values.
  description: The ThreatTarget constructor initializes a new instance of the ThreatTarget
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the threat target, typically
    configuring default threat levels, target references, and associated data structures
    needed for threat management in the game AI system. The constructor ensures that
    all necessary member variables are properly initialized before the object is used
    in combat or threat-related operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ThreatTarget Initialization
    code: 'ThreatTarget target;

      // Initializes a new ThreatTarget with default settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the AI system when creating
    threat targets for mobs or NPCs. Developers should not directly instantiate ThreatTarget
    objects unless working at a low-level AI implementation level.
