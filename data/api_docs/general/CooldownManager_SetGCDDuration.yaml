  class: CooldownManager
  method: SetGCDDuration
  signature: void CooldownManager::SetGCDDuration(uint32 durationMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the global cooldown duration for the CooldownManager instance.
  description: The SetGCDDuration method configures the global cooldown (GCD) duration
    for a CooldownManager instance. In World of Warcraft mechanics, the global cooldown
    represents a universal cooldown that affects all abilities and spells cast by
    a player or creature. This method allows developers to modify the GCD duration,
    which typically defaults to 1500 milliseconds (1.5 seconds). The change takes
    effect immediately for subsequent ability applications. This is commonly used
    in custom spell systems, game mechanics modifications, or when implementing special
    effects that alter cooldown behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: durationMs
    description: The new global cooldown duration in milliseconds. Valid values are
      typically positive integers, with common values being 1500 (default) or other
      multiples of 250 for standard game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a custom global cooldown
    code: 'CooldownManager* cm = player->GetCooldownManager();

      cm->SetGCDDuration(2000); // Set GCD to 2 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting to default global cooldown
    code: 'CooldownManager* cm = player->GetCooldownManager();

      cm->SetGCDDuration(1500); // Reset to standard 1.5 second GCD'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal GCD state of the CooldownManager.
    It does not affect existing cooldowns already in progress but will apply to all
    future ability applications. The change is immediate and affects all subsequent
    spell/ability casts using this manager.
  warnings: Setting extremely low GCD values (e.g., below 250ms) may cause client-side
    issues or violate game balance. Ensure that any modifications respect the intended
    gameplay experience and do not create unfair advantages or visual glitches.
