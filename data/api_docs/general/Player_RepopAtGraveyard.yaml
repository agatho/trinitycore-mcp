  signature: void Player::RepopAtGraveyard()
documentation:
  brief: RepopAtGraveyard repopulates the player at their last graveyard location
    after death.
  description: This method handles the process of returning the player to their last
    known graveyard location upon death, ensuring that the player's body is properly
    resurrected at the appropriate location. It typically occurs when a player dies
    and the game attempts to respawn them at the nearest graveyard. The method is
    part of the standard player death handling mechanism in TrinityCore, where players
    are automatically respawned at their last graveyard location if they have not
    yet been resurrected by another player or by a spirit healer. This method does
    not require any parameters and is called internally during the player's death
    process.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Player::RepopAtGraveyard() {\n    // Implementation details\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of player death state, ensuring proper
    respawn location, and maintaining game balance between player resurrection mechanics
    and graveyard locations. This method is typically invoked during the player's
    death process when no other resurrection options are available.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code unless explicitly
    required; it is intended to be used internally during player death handling. Improper
    invocation may lead to incorrect respawn behavior or game state issues.
