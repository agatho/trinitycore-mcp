  class: AccountMgr
  method: CheckPassword
  signature: bool AccountMgr::CheckPassword(uint32 accountId, std::string password)
documentation:
  brief: Verifies if a provided password matches the stored password for a given account
    ID.
  description: The CheckPassword method is used to authenticate an account by comparing
    a provided plaintext password against the hashed password stored in the database
    for the specified account. This method is typically invoked during the login process
    to validate user credentials. It performs a secure comparison using the stored
    hash and the provided password, ensuring that sensitive authentication data is
    not exposed. The method returns true if the password matches, false otherwise.
    This function is crucial for maintaining account security and access control within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account to verify. Must be a valid,
      existing account ID in the database.
  - name: password
    description: The plaintext password provided by the user for verification. Should
      be a string containing the user's input.
  returns: Returns true if the provided password matches the stored password hash
    for the given account ID, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate
    an incorrect password or that the account does not exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Account Password Verification
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nstd::string password = \"userpassword\";\nbool\
      \ isValid = AccountMgr::CheckPassword(accountId, password);\nif (isValid) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with login\n    printf(\"Authentication successful\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Reject login attempt\n    printf(\"Invalid credentials\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a secure hash comparison and should not be used for
    password storage or modification. The actual password hashing is handled by the
    database layer, which uses secure methods such as bcrypt or similar. This function
    is typically called from login handlers within the authentication system.
  warnings: Do not use this method for storing passwords; it is strictly for verification
    purposes. Ensure that account IDs are validated before calling to prevent potential
    security issues. Avoid logging or exposing password attempts in production environments.
