    * pvp)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler with a provided OutdoorPvP instance
  description: The OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler constructor initializes the handler
    with a given OutdoorPvP object. This method sets up internal references and prepares
    the handler to manage control zone behaviors within the specified OutdoorPvP area.
    The handler is responsible for tracking player activities, controlling zone ownership,
    and managing rewards or penalties based on territorial control. It typically gets
    called during the initialization phase of OutdoorPvP systems when zones are being
    set up for gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: pvp
    description: Pointer to the OutdoorPvP instance that this handler will manage.
      Must not be null and should represent a valid OutdoorPvP zone.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler
    code: "OutdoorPvP* pvpInstance = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvP(1234);\nif (pvpInstance)\n\
      {\n    OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler handler(pvpInstance);\n    // Handler is\
      \ now initialized and ready to manage zone control\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization logic. It primarily
    assigns the provided OutdoorPvP pointer to internal member variables. Developers
    should ensure that the pvp parameter points to a valid, already initialized OutdoorPvP
    object before calling this constructor.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this constructor will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate that the OutdoorPvP instance exists and is
    properly initialized before creating a handler for it.
