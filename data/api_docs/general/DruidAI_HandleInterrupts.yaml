  signature: bool DruidAI::HandleInterrupts(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles interrupting spell casts by enemies for the Druid AI.
  description: The HandleInterrupts method is responsible for managing the Druid AI's
    response to enemy spell interruptions. It evaluates whether an interrupt should
    be performed based on the current target and available abilities. The method typically
    checks if the target is casting a spell that can be interrupted, verifies the
    Druid has sufficient mana and appropriate abilities (such as Nature's Grasp or
    Improved Moonkin Form), and then executes the interrupt if conditions are met.
    This method plays a crucial role in maintaining the Druid's effectiveness during
    combat by preventing enemy spells from completing successfully.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's spell cast status
      or identifier. The value is modified to reflect the interrupt outcome.
  returns: Returns true if the interrupt was successfully executed, false otherwise.
    A return of false may indicate insufficient mana, invalid target state, or inability
    to interrupt the current spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Usage
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nif (druidAI->HandleInterrupts(&targetId)) {\n  \
      \  // Interrupt successful\n    printf(\"Spell interrupted successfully\\n\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Interrupt failed\n    printf(\"Failed to interrupt spell\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupt with Mana Check
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nif (druidAI->GetMana() > 50 && druidAI->HandleInterrupts(&targetId))\
      \ {\n    // Interrupt successful with sufficient mana\n    printf(\"Spell interrupted\
      \ with %d mana remaining\\n\", druidAI->GetMana());\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      Cannot interrupt: insufficient mana or invalid target\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the Druid AI's update cycle in combat
    situations. The method assumes that the target pointer points to a valid spell-casting
    entity and may modify the target's state. It's important to ensure that the Druid
    has the appropriate talent nodes and abilities enabled for successful interruption.
  warnings: The method may fail silently if the target is not casting a spell or if
    the Druid lacks the required interrupt ability. Always validate the return value
    before assuming an interrupt occurred. Using this method without proper target
    validation can lead to undefined behavior.
