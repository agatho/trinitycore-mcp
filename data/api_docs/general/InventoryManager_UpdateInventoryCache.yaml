  signature: void InventoryManager::UpdateInventoryCache()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cached inventory data for a player, ensuring synchronization
    between client and server state.
  description: The UpdateInventoryCache method refreshes the internal cache of a player's
    inventory items. This function is typically invoked when inventory changes occur
    to maintain consistency between the game server's representation and what the
    client displays. It ensures that all item-related data such as quantities, slots,
    and equipped status are accurately reflected in memory. The method may also trigger
    updates to the player's UI and perform necessary validation checks on inventory
    integrity.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: player->GetInventory()->UpdateInventoryCache();
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Item Addition
    code: "Item* newItem = player->AddItem(itemTemplate, 1);\nif (newItem)\n{\n  \
      \  player->GetInventory()->UpdateInventoryCache();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any inventory modification to ensure client-server
    synchronization. It may perform internal validation and could potentially trigger
    additional events or callbacks related to inventory changes.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper conditions can lead
    to performance degradation. It's recommended to batch inventory updates rather
    than calling it for every single item change.
