  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: ValidateCharacterData
  signature: bool BotSessionFactory::ValidateCharacterData(int characterGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates character data for a bot session using the provided character GUID
  description: The ValidateCharacterData method checks whether the character data
    associated with the given GUID is valid and can be used for creating or managing
    a bot session. This validation typically includes checking if the character exists
    in the database, ensuring the character's data is consistent, and verifying that
    the character meets all requirements for bot usage within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method returns true if the character data passes all validation checks, otherwise
    false. This function is crucial for maintaining data integrity when handling bot
    characters in World of Warcraft server environments.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character to validate. Must be
      a valid database record identifier representing an existing character in the
      World of Warcraft database.
  returns: Returns true if the character data is valid and can be used for bot operations,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the character does not exist,
    has invalid data, or fails other internal validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Character Validation
    code: "BotSessionFactory sessionFactory;\nint guid = 12345;\nbool isValid = sessionFactory.ValidateCharacterData(guid);\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with bot session creation\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Character data is valid\" << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ character data\n    std::cout << \"Invalid character data\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to validate character existence
    and data consistency. It should be called before attempting to create or manage
    any bot session using the specified character. The validation process may involve
    checking multiple tables in the TrinityCore database for character-related information.
  warnings: Ensure that the characterGuid parameter is properly validated before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid GUID could lead to unexpected behavior or database
    errors. This method should not be called with a GUID that has been deleted from
    the database.
