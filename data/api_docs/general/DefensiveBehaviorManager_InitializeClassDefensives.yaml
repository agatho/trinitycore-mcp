documentation:
  brief: Initializes class-specific defensive abilities and behaviors for the DefensiveBehaviorManager.
  description: The InitializeClassDefensives method sets up and configures all class-based
    defensive mechanisms and behaviors within the DefensiveBehaviorManager. This includes
    initializing cooldowns, health thresholds, and defensive ability states specific
    to the player's class. The method is typically called during character initialization
    or when switching classes to ensure that all defensive capabilities are properly
    configured for the current gameplay context. It prepares the manager to handle
    defensive actions such as spell blocking, damage reduction, and class-specific
    protective measures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'DefensiveBehaviorManager* defManager = new DefensiveBehaviorManager();

      defManager->InitializeClassDefensives();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the manager's initialization
    phase. It assumes that class information has already been set and validated. The
    method may perform expensive operations such as loading ability data from configuration
    files or database entries.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that all previous defensive configurations
    are properly reset before calling this method again.
