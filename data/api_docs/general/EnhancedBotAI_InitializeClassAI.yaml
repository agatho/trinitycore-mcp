documentation:
  brief: Initializes the class-specific AI behavior for an enhanced bot
  description: The InitializeClassAI method sets up and configures the artificial
    intelligence routines specific to a particular class for an enhanced bot. This
    method is typically called during the bot's initialization phase to establish
    class-based abilities, spell selections, and combat strategies. It ensures that
    the bot's AI adapts to the selected class's mechanics, including ability cooldowns,
    resource management, and tactical decision-making patterns. The method prepares
    the bot for active gameplay by configuring its class-specific behaviors and ensuring
    proper integration with the TrinityCore AI system.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'EnhancedBotAI* botAI = new EnhancedBotAI();

      botAI->InitializeClassAI();

      // Bot is now initialized with class-specific AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the bot's initialization process.
    It typically interacts with the TrinityCore AI subsystem and may require the bot
    to have a valid class assignment before execution. The method may perform memory
    allocations for class-specific AI data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same bot instance may lead to
    undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the bot has been properly configured
    with a class before invoking this method.
