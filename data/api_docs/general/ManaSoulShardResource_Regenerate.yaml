  method: Regenerate
  signature: void ManaSoulShardResource::Regenerate(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the mana soul shard resource by regenerating a portion of its stored
    energy based on the elapsed time.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for incrementally restoring mana
    soul shards over time. This function is typically invoked during game ticks or
    update cycles to simulate the natural regeneration of magical resources. It takes
    into account the time difference (diff) since the last regeneration event and
    applies appropriate scaling to determine how much energy should be added back
    to the resource pool. The method ensures that the resource does not exceed its
    maximum capacity and may perform additional checks such as player state or cooldowns
    before applying changes.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'uint32 diff = 1000; // 1 second since last update

      manaSoulShardResource->Regenerate(diff);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdateManaSoulShards()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastUpdateTime();\n\
      \    for (auto& shard : playerManaShards)\n    {\n        shard->Regenerate(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called from within the core game update loop. It's
    important to note that regeneration rates might be affected by buffs, debuffs,
    or special abilities that modify resource recovery mechanics. The diff parameter
    should represent milliseconds elapsed since the last call for accurate time-based
    calculations.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without ensuring proper timing intervals;
    excessive calls may lead to unexpected resource accumulation. Also, ensure that
    the ManaSoulShardResource instance is valid and initialized before invoking Regenerate.
