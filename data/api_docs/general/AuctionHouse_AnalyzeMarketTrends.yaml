  class: AuctionHouse
  method: AnalyzeMarketTrends
  signature: void AuctionHouse::AnalyzeMarketTrends(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market trends for a specified item in the auction house system.
  description: The AnalyzeMarketTrends method processes auction data for a given item
    ID to determine current market behavior, including price fluctuations, demand
    patterns, and bidding activity. This function is typically used by the auction
    house system to generate dynamic pricing recommendations or to identify items
    that are experiencing unusual market activity. The method may update internal
    tracking structures or trigger notifications based on detected trends. It operates
    within the context of TrinityCore's auction house mechanics and requires valid
    item identifiers to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to analyze trends for. Must correspond
      to a valid entry in the game's item database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Analyze trends for a common weapon
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionMgr;

      ah->AnalyzeMarketTrends(12345); // Analyze trends for a specific sword'
    language: cpp
  - title: Batch trend analysis for multiple items
    code: "std::vector<uint32> itemIds = {12345, 67890, 54321};\nfor (uint32 id :\
      \ itemIds)\n{\n    sAuctionMgr->AnalyzeMarketTrends(id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to gather auction data and may
    have performance implications when processing many items simultaneously. It should
    be called during appropriate maintenance windows or background tasks rather than
    in high-frequency game loops.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid item IDs may result in undefined behavior
    or database errors. Ensure that the itemId parameter refers to an existing item
    in the game's database before invoking this function.
