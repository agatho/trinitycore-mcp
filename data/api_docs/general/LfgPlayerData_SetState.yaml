  signature: void LfgPlayerData::SetState(LfgState state)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the LFG state of a player
  description: Sets the current state of the player's Looking For Group (LFG) participation.
    This method is used internally by the TrinityCore LFG system to track and manage
    player group finding states during dungeon, raid, or other group activities. The
    state transition affects how the player is matched with others and influences
    their visibility in LFG queues.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: The new LfgState value to assign to the player. Valid values include
      LFG_STATE_NONE, LFG_STATE_ROLECHECK, LFG_STATE_QUEUED, LFG_STATE_PROPOSAL, LFG_STATE_SUMMON,
      LFG_STATE_BOOT, LFG_STATE_FINISHED, and LFG_STATE_INVALID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a player to queued state
    code: 'LfgPlayerData* playerData = sLFGMgr->GetPlayerData(playerGuid);

      playerData->SetState(LFG_STATE_QUEUED);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Transitioning player to finished state after group completion
    code: 'LfgPlayerData* playerData = sLFGMgr->GetPlayerData(playerGuid);

      playerData->SetState(LFG_STATE_FINISHED);

      // Clear any pending LFG data for this player

      sLFGMgr->RemovePlayerFromLFGQueue(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not trigger any automatic state transitions or notifications.
    It simply updates the internal state variable. The LFG manager is responsible
    for handling state-based logic and communications with the client.
  warnings: Directly calling SetState without proper context may cause inconsistencies
    in LFG matching behavior. Always ensure that state changes align with expected
    game flow and player actions.
