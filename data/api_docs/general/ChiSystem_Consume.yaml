  class: ChiSystem
  method: Consume
  signature: bool ChiSystem::Consume(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of chi from the ChiSystem
  description: The Consume method reduces the current chi amount stored within the
    ChiSystem by the specified quantity. This operation is typically used in game
    mechanics where players or NPCs spend chi to perform special abilities, talents,
    or actions. The method will only succeed if there is sufficient chi available
    to consume. If the requested amount exceeds the current chi balance, the consumption
    will fail and return false without modifying the chi count.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified amount of chi was successfully consumed;
    otherwise returns false if there was insufficient chi available to fulfill the
    request.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Consumption
    code: "if (player->GetChiSystem()->Consume(50)) {\n    // Chi successfully consumed,\
      \ proceed with ability\n    player->CastSpell(player, 12345, true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Not enough chi to consume\n    player->SendNotification(\"Not enough\
      \ chi!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other ChiSystem methods
    such as GetChi() or SetChi() to manage player resources. It's important to check
    the return value before performing actions that depend on successful chi consumption.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking its return value may lead to unexpected
    behavior if insufficient chi exists. Always verify that sufficient chi is available
    before attempting consumption.
