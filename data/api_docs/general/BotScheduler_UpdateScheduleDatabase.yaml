  brief: Updates the database records for all scheduled bot actions
  description: The UpdateScheduleDatabase method synchronizes the current state of
    bot scheduling with the persistent database storage. This method is responsible
    for saving any changes made to bot schedules, including new schedules, modified
    schedules, or completed schedule entries. It ensures that scheduled bot activities
    are properly persisted across server restarts and sessions. The method typically
    operates during server maintenance windows or when specific scheduling events
    occur.

  notes: This method should be called periodically to ensure schedule persistence.
    It may block during database I/O operations, so it's recommended to call it from
    a background thread or during low-traffic periods.
