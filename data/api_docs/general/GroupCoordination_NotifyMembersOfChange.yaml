  signature: void GroupCoordination::NotifyMembersOfChange(const std::string & change)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies all group members of a change in group coordination
  description: The NotifyMembersOfChange method broadcasts a specified change message
    to all players currently in the group. This method is typically used within the
    GroupCoordination system to synchronize state changes across group members, ensuring
    that all participants are aware of important updates such as role assignments,
    loot settings, or tactical adjustments during group activities. The method operates
    synchronously and sends the notification directly to each group member's client
    interface.
  parameters:
  - name: change
    description: A string describing the change that occurred in group coordination.
      This message is typically formatted for display to players and may include role
      names, loot rules, or other relevant group status updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Notify Group of New Loot Master
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coord = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordination();

      coord->NotifyMembersOfChange("New Loot Master: PlayerName");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcast Tactical Change
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coord = player->GetGroup()->GetGroupCoordination();

      coord->NotifyMembersOfChange("Tactical Change: Moving to Position 3");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GroupCoordination object is properly initialized
    and that the group has active members. The implementation likely uses internal
    messaging systems to efficiently distribute notifications without causing performance
    bottlenecks.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group with no active members will result in no
    action being taken, but it's recommended to verify group membership before invoking
    this method to avoid unnecessary processing.
