documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the GuildMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the GuildMgr
    class, providing global access to the guild management system. This method ensures
    that only one instance of GuildMgr exists throughout the TrinityCore server lifecycle.
    The returned pointer can be used to access all guild-related functionality including
    guild creation, member management, guild permissions, and guild events. This is
    a thread-safe implementation that guarantees consistent access to guild data across
    different parts of the game server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single GuildMgr instance. The method never returns NULL
    as it's implemented as a singleton with proper initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Guild Manager for Guild Operations
    code: "GuildMgr* guildManager = GuildMgr::instance();\nif (guildManager)\n{\n\
      \    // Perform guild operations\n    Guild* myGuild = guildManager->GetGuildById(guildId);\n\
      \    // ... other guild management tasks\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Guild Manager in Player Login Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    GuildMgr* guildMgr = GuildMgr::instance();\n\
      \    if (guildMgr && player->GetGuildId() > 0)\n    {\n        Guild* playerGuild\
      \ = guildMgr->GetGuildById(player->GetGuildId());\n        if (playerGuild)\n\
      \        {\n            // Update guild information for logged in player\n \
      \           playerGuild->HandleMemberLogin(player);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the Meyers singleton pattern which is thread-safe in C++11
    and later. The GuildMgr instance is initialized during server startup and remains
    valid throughout the server's lifetime. No explicit cleanup is required as the
    singleton is destroyed automatically when the application terminates.
  warnings: While this is a singleton, be cautious about overusing it in performance-critical
    sections. The GuildMgr should not be used for frequent, small operations that
    could be optimized by caching or direct member access. Also, avoid storing references
    to the returned pointer across different server ticks as the singleton might be
    reinitialized during server maintenance.
