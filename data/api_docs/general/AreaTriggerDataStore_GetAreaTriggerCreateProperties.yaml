    AreaTriggerCreatePropertiesId & areaTriggerCreatePropertiesId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves area trigger creation properties by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetAreaTriggerCreateProperties method fetches the creation properties
    associated with a specific area trigger identified by its unique ID. These properties
    define how the area trigger is initialized and behave within the game world, including
    visual effects, collision detection, and activation conditions. This method is
    typically used during zone loading or when spawning area triggers dynamically.
    The returned pointer provides access to immutable data that describes the trigger's
    behavior and appearance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an AreaTriggerCreateProperties object if a matching
    entry exists; otherwise, returns nullptr if no area trigger with the specified
    ID is found in the data store.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Area Trigger Properties
    code: "AreaTriggerCreatePropertiesId triggerId = 12345;\nconst AreaTriggerCreateProperties*\
      \ properties = sAreaTriggerDataStore->GetAreaTriggerCreateProperties(triggerId);\n\
      if (properties)\n{\n    // Use properties to initialize or modify area trigger\
      \ behavior\n    std::cout << \"Found area trigger with radius: \" << properties->Radius\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in an internal data structure, so performance
    depends on the efficiency of the underlying container used for storing area trigger
    definitions. It is safe to call from multiple threads as long as the data store
    itself is thread-safe.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided AreaTriggerCreatePropertiesId is valid before
    calling this method, as invalid IDs may result in a nullptr return without error
    reporting. Avoid modifying the returned object directly since it's const.
