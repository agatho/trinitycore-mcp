documentation:
  brief: Teleports units to a target location with a visual loading screen effect.
  description: The EffectTeleportUnitsWithVisualLoadingScreen method handles the teleportation
    of units (such as players or creatures) to a specified destination location while
    displaying a visual loading screen. This method is typically invoked as part of
    spell effects in TrinityCore's spell system, ensuring that the teleportation process
    is visually smooth and provides feedback to the user during the transition. The
    method likely manages client-side loading screen display, unit movement, and potential
    state transitions during the teleport event. It may also handle checks for valid
    targets, line-of-sight constraints, and other spell mechanics relevant to teleportation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell effect handler
    code: "void Spell::EffectTeleportUnitsWithVisualLoadingScreen()\n{\n    // Implementation\
      \ would handle unit teleportation with visual loading screen\n    // This is\
      \ a placeholder for internal spell logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the client's UI system to display a loading
    screen during teleportation. It may be used in conjunction with other spell effects
    or mechanics such as target validation, area-of-effect checks, and cooldown handling.
  warnings: This method should only be called from within a spell effect context.
    Improper usage outside of a valid spell execution flow may lead to client desynchronization
    or unexpected behavior.
