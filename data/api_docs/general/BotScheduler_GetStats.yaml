  class: BotScheduler
  method: GetStats
  signature: const SchedulerStats & BotScheduler::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current statistics of the bot scheduler instance.
  description: The GetStats method provides access to a snapshot of runtime statistics
    for the BotScheduler. These statistics typically include information such as the
    number of bots managed, execution timing data, task completion rates, and other
    performance metrics relevant to the scheduler's operation. This method is useful
    for monitoring and debugging bot behavior within the TrinityCore environment.
    The returned SchedulerStats object is immutable and reflects the state at the
    time of the call.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a SchedulerStats structure containing current operational
    statistics for the bot scheduler. This includes metrics like active bots, task
    counts, execution times, and other relevant performance data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Bot Scheduler Statistics
    code: 'BotScheduler& scheduler = BotScheduler::Instance();

      const SchedulerStats& stats = scheduler.GetStats();

      std::cout << "Active bots: " << stats.activeBots << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Total tasks executed: " << stats.totalTasks << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned SchedulerStats object is a const reference and should not be
    modified. It represents a point-in-time snapshot of the scheduler's state, so
    repeated calls may yield different values if the scheduler is actively processing
    tasks.
