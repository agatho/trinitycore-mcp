  signature: bool PriestAI::HandleCombatBehaviorPriorities(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and prioritizes combat behaviors for a priest AI unit during active
    combat.
  description: The HandleCombatBehaviorPriorities method is responsible for determining
    the most appropriate combat action for a priest AI unit based on current game
    state, target conditions, and spell availability. It assesses various priority
    levels such as healing, damage dealing, and defensive actions to select the optimal
    behavior. This method typically integrates with the broader AI decision-making
    framework and may influence the AI's choice of spells or abilities during combat
    encounters. The method returns true if a valid behavior was selected and executed,
    or false if no suitable action could be determined.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a combat behavior was successfully prioritized and executed;
    otherwise returns false if no valid behavior could be determined or executed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "if (priestAI->HandleCombatBehaviorPriorities(&targetId)) {\n    // Behavior\
      \ was handled, continue with next AI step\n} else {\n    // No valid behavior\
      \ found, fallback to default actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the main AI update loop during combat.
    It assumes that the AI unit has a valid target and sufficient mana/resources for
    spell casting. The actual behavior prioritization logic may depend on class-specific
    rules, current health states of the priest and target, and cooldowns of available
    spells.
  warnings: The method may fail to return a valid action if the target is invalid
    or if all possible actions are currently on cooldown. Developers should ensure
    proper fallback mechanisms are in place when this method returns false.
