documentation:
  brief: Builds a values update for the player's data fields
  description: This method constructs and populates the data fields for a player object,
    typically used in packet updates to other players or in server-side operations.
    It handles the internal representation of player data including stats, attributes,
    and game state information. The method is primarily used for sending updates about
    player's current state to other players or in server-side processing.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array that will hold the updated data values
      for the player's fields
  - name: flags
    description: Integer representing the flags used for determining which data fields
      are being updated
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to a const Player object that represents the target player
      for which data is being built
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int data[256];

      int flags = 0;

      const Player* target = player;

      player->BuildValuesUpdate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player-related methods
    for updating player data fields. It's important to note that the data array must
    be properly allocated and sized before calling this method. The method may involve
    complex calculations depending on the flags provided.
  warnings: The method requires careful handling of memory allocation as it modifies
    the data array directly. Incorrect flag values can lead to incorrect data updates
    or memory corruption.
