documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes gossip menu addons from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadGossipMenuAddon method is responsible for loading all gossip
    menu addon data from the database tables into memory. This includes loading additional
    text, conditions, and other metadata associated with gossip menus that extend
    beyond basic menu entries. The method typically runs during server startup or
    reload operations to ensure that all custom gossip interactions are properly initialized
    and available for use by players. It processes records from tables such as `gossip_menu_option`
    and related addon tables to build internal data structures that support dynamic
    NPC dialogues.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadGossipMenuAddon();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during server startup or reload operations
    and should not be invoked manually during normal gameplay. The loaded data is
    stored in internal caches for fast lookup during player interactions with NPCs.
