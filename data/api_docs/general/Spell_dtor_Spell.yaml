  brief: Destroys a Spell object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The Spell destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory and
    resources allocated during the spell's lifetime. It ensures that any dynamically
    allocated data, references to game objects, and internal spell state are properly
    released to prevent memory leaks. This method is automatically invoked when a
    Spell object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destruction process
    typically involves calling cleanup routines for spell effects, removing the spell
    from active spell lists, and notifying the associated unit (caster) that the spell
    has ended. In TrinityCore's architecture, this destructor plays a crucial role
    in maintaining memory integrity during combat and spell casting operations.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of Spell object
    code: "void CastSpellExample(Unit* caster, SpellInfo const* spellInfo) {\n   \
      \ Spell* spell = new Spell(caster, spellInfo, TRIGGERED_NONE);\n    spell->Prepare();\n\
      \    // Spell is automatically destroyed when it goes out of scope\n}\n// Destructor\
      \ called here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of Spell object
    code: "void HandleSpellCast(Unit* caster, SpellInfo const* spellInfo) {\n    Spell*\
      \ spell = new Spell(caster, spellInfo, TRIGGERED_NONE);\n    spell->Prepare();\n\
      \    spell->Cast(true);\n    delete spell; // Explicit destructor call\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically called by the game engine's memory management
    system. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless they are
    explicitly managing Spell object lifetimes. The destruction process includes cleanup
    of spell targets, effect application state, and removal from active spell queues.
    This method is part of TrinityCore's RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern for spell management.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly on stack-allocated Spell objects as
    this will result in undefined behavior. The destructor assumes that all necessary
    cleanup has been performed by the game engine before it is called. Avoid creating
    Spell objects in tight loops without proper cleanup, as this may lead to memory
    leaks if not handled correctly.
