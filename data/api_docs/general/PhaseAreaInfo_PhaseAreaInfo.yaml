  class: PhaseAreaInfo
  method: PhaseAreaInfo
  signature: void PhaseAreaInfo::PhaseAreaInfo(const PhaseInfoStruct * phaseInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PhaseAreaInfo object with the provided phase information structure.
  description: The PhaseAreaInfo constructor initializes the internal state of a PhaseAreaInfo
    object using the supplied PhaseInfoStruct. This method sets up the necessary data
    structures and configurations required for managing phase-related area information
    within the TrinityCore framework. It is typically invoked during object creation
    or when updating phase data for specific areas in the game world. The initialization
    process ensures that all relevant phase flags, masks, and area associations are
    properly configured according to the provided phase information.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseInfo
    description: Pointer to a PhaseInfoStruct containing the phase configuration data.
      This structure defines the phase identifiers, associated areas, and visibility
      rules that govern how players interact with specific regions in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'PhaseInfoStruct info;

      info.phaseId = 1234;

      info.areaMask = 0x00000001;

      PhaseAreaInfo phaseArea(&info);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing with Complex Phase Data
    code: 'PhaseInfoStruct info;

      info.phaseId = 5678;

      info.areaMask = 0x0000000F;

      info.flags = PHASE_FLAG_INVERSE | PHASE_FLAG_VISIBLE;

      PhaseAreaInfo phaseArea(&info);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs shallow copying of the PhaseInfoStruct data. The
    caller must ensure that the phaseInfo parameter remains valid for the lifetime
    of the PhaseAreaInfo object. The implementation assumes that the input structure
    contains valid and properly formatted data.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to phaseInfo will result in undefined behavior.
    Always validate the input parameter before calling this constructor.
