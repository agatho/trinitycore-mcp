documentation:
  brief: Equip a new item to the specified slot position on the player
  description: The EquipNewItem method allows a player to equip an item at a specific
    slot position within their inventory. This method handles the actual equipping
    process, including updating the player's equipment state and potentially triggering
    related game mechanics such as stat updates or spell activation. The method returns
    the item pointer after successful equip, allowing for further processing or validation
    of the equipped item.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The slot position where the item should be equipped (0-18). This
      typically corresponds to inventory slots like head, neck, shoulder, etc.
  - name: item
    description: The item ID of the item to be equipped. This can be a specific item
      ID or a random loot item ID depending on context.
  - name: context
    description: The context for equipping, which may affect how the item is handled
      (e.g., random loot, quest items, etc.).
  - name: update
    description: Whether to update the player's equipment state. If true, the method
      will update the player's stats and potentially trigger related game mechanics.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the item that was equipped, or nullptr if the operation
    failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: Item* equippedItem = player->EquipNewItem(0, 12345, 0, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->EquipNewItem(1, 12345, 1, false);\nif (item != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process the equipped item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory management
    methods. It may trigger updates to player stats and can be used for both quest
    items and random loot items. The method handles both direct item equipping and
    context-based equipping.
  warnings: The method may fail if the slot position is invalid or if the item ID
    does not exist in the game database. Care should be taken when using this method
    with different contexts as it can affect how items are handled.
