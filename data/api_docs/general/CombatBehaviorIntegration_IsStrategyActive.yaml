  method: IsStrategyActive
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::IsStrategyActive(uint32 flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified combat strategy flag is currently active in the
    CombatBehaviorIntegration system.
  description: The IsStrategyActive method determines if a particular combat strategy,
    identified by a unique flag value, is currently enabled or active within the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    class. This method is typically used during AI decision-making processes to evaluate
    which combat behaviors should be considered or executed. The flag parameter represents
    a bitmask value that corresponds to specific strategies defined in the system.
    The method returns true if the strategy is active and false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for dynamic combat behavior management where different strategies may
    be enabled or disabled based on situational factors such as target type, health
    status, or environmental conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: A uint32 bitmask value representing the combat strategy to check.
      This flag should correspond to predefined strategy constants defined within
      the CombatBehaviorIntegration class or related enums.
  returns: Returns true if the specified combat strategy flag is currently active,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a specific strategy is active
    code: "if (combatBehavior->IsStrategyActive(COMBAT_STRATEGY_MELEE)) {\n    //\
      \ Execute melee combat behavior\n    player->CastSpell(target, MELEE_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple strategies in sequence
    code: "uint32 activeStrategies = 0;\nif (combatBehavior->IsStrategyActive(COMBAT_STRATEGY_RANGED))\
      \ {\n    activeStrategies |= COMBAT_STRATEGY_RANGED;\n}\nif (combatBehavior->IsStrategyActive(COMBAT_STRATEGY_CASTER))\
      \ {\n    activeStrategies |= COMBAT_STRATEGY_CASTER;\n}\n// Use activeStrategies\
      \ bitmask for further logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple flag check and should have minimal performance
    impact. The implementation likely uses bitwise operations to determine if the
    specified flag is set within an internal strategy state variable. Developers should
    ensure that the flag values passed to this method are valid strategy identifiers
    defined in the system.
