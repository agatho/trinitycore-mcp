  signature: bool FlightMasterManager::IsNearQuestObjectives(const TaxiNodesEntry
    * nodeEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a flight master node is near quest objectives for the
    current player.
  description: The IsNearQuestObjectives method checks if the specified taxi node
    (representing a flight master) is located near any active quest objectives for
    the player. This functionality is used primarily in the context of flight path
    validation and quest tracking, ensuring that players can only access flight paths
    that are relevant to their current quest progress. The method evaluates the spatial
    relationship between the flight master's location and the locations of quest objectives,
    returning true if they are within a defined proximity threshold. This helps maintain
    game logic consistency by preventing players from using flight masters that would
    otherwise be inaccessible based on their current quest state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the flight master node is near at least one active quest
    objective; otherwise, returns false. The method considers both the physical distance
    and the quest relevance when making this determination.
  examples:
  - title: Check Flight Master Proximity to Quest Objectives
    code: "if (flightMasterManager.IsNearQuestObjectives(taxiNodeEntry)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can use this flight master\n    player->AddTaxiPathToSession(taxiNodeEntry);\n\
      } else {\n    // Flight master is not accessible due to quest restrictions\n\
      \    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot access this flight master at this\
      \ time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs distance calculations and checks against active
    quest data. It may involve caching or optimization techniques to avoid repeated
    expensive computations during frequent calls, such as when processing multiple
    flight masters in a single session.
  warnings: The method assumes that the TaxiNodesEntry parameter is valid and properly
    initialized. Incorrect node data could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect
    access control for flight paths.
