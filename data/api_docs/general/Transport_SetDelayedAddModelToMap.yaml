documentation:
  brief: Marks the transport to be added to the map during the next update cycle.
  description: The SetDelayedAddModelToMap method flags the transport object to be
    scheduled for addition to the game map during the next update iteration. This
    is typically used when a transport needs to be initialized or re-added to the
    world after being removed, ensuring that the operation occurs at a safe point
    in the game loop rather than immediately. The method does not perform the actual
    addition but sets an internal flag that will be processed by the transport's update
    logic. This approach helps prevent potential issues with map state changes during
    active gameplay.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Transport* transport = new Transport();

      transport->SetDelayedAddModelToMap();

      // The transport will be added to the map on next update cycle'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    handling transport lifecycle events. It should not be called directly in most
    user code unless implementing custom transport behavior. The actual addition to
    the map happens asynchronously during the next game update cycle.
