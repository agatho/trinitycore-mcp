documentation:
  brief: Copies the state of another BotDatabasePool instance.
  description: The BotDatabasePool constructor is used to create a new instance of
    the BotDatabasePool class by copying the state from an existing BotDatabasePool
    object. This copy constructor ensures that all internal database connection pool
    settings, configurations, and connection states are duplicated into the newly
    created instance. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this allows for
    consistent database handling across multiple bot instances while maintaining separate
    connection pools for each. The copied instance will have identical database configuration
    parameters but independent connection management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BotDatabasePool by copying an existing one
    code: 'BotDatabasePool originalPool;

      // Configure originalPool with database settings...

      BotDatabasePool newPool(originalPool); // Copy constructor usage

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a copy constructor, so it performs a shallow copy of the internal
    state. Any changes to the original instance after copying will not affect the
    copied instance unless explicit synchronization mechanisms are implemented. The
    constructor should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments where connection
    pool states may change concurrently.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this constructor in concurrent scenarios, as it
    creates a separate copy of the database pool configuration. If the original pool's
    configuration changes after copying, the new instance will not reflect these changes.
    Also, ensure that the source object is fully initialized before performing the
    copy operation to avoid undefined behavior.
