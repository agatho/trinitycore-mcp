  class: CharmInfo
  method: SetIsReturning
  signature: void CharmInfo::SetIsReturning(bool val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the charm return state for a player's pet or minion.
  description: The SetIsReturning method configures whether a charmed creature (such
    as a pet or minion) is currently returning to its owner. This flag affects the
    behavior of the creature during the charm state, particularly when the creature
    is not actively engaged in combat or following commands. When set to true, the
    creature will attempt to return to its owner's location. When set to false, the
    creature will remain in its current position or continue with its assigned behavior.
    This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework during charm
    state management and pet AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: Boolean value indicating whether the charmed creature should return
      to its owner. True enables the return state, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a pet to return to owner
    code: "CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();\nif (charmInfo)\n{\n   \
      \ charmInfo->SetIsReturning(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling return state for a charmed creature
    code: "Unit* pet = player->GetPet();\nif (pet && pet->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CHARM))\n\
      {\n    CharmInfo* charmInfo = pet->GetCharmInfo();\n    if (charmInfo)\n   \
      \ {\n        charmInfo->SetIsReturning(false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of pet and minion AI behavior
    within TrinityCore. It's typically invoked when managing the charm state transitions
    or when modifying how a charmed creature behaves during the return process. The
    flag set by this method directly influences the creature's movement logic and
    may affect combat behavior.
  warnings: Modifying this flag directly should be done carefully as it can interfere
    with normal pet AI behavior. It is recommended to use this method only in specific
    circumstances where custom charm behavior is required, rather than modifying it
    during regular gameplay operations.
