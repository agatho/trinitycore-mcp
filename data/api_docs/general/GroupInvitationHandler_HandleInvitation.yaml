    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a group invitation packet from a player and handles the invitation
    logic.
  description: The HandleInvitation method in the GroupInvitationHandler class is
    responsible for processing incoming party invitation packets sent by players.
    It validates the invitation request, checks if the inviting player and invited
    player are eligible to form a group, and manages the invitation state. This method
    typically verifies that the inviter has permission to invite, that the invitee
    is not already in a group, and that the invitation hasn't expired or been rejected.
    The method returns true if the invitation was successfully processed and false
    if there were validation errors or if the invitation failed for any reason.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: A constant reference to a WorldPackets::Party::PartyInvite packet
      containing the invitation data including inviter GUID, invitee GUID, and party
      information.
  returns: Returns true if the group invitation was successfully processed and accepted.
    Returns false if the invitation failed due to validation errors, such as invalid
    player states, expired invitations, or permission issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "bool result = handler.HandleInvitation(packet);\nif (result)\n{\n    //\
      \ Invitation processed successfully\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"group\", \"Player invitation\
      \ accepted\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Invitation failed\n    LOG_ERROR(\"group\"\
      , \"Failed to process player invitation\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the network packet handling system when
    a PARTY_INVITE packet is received. It interacts with group management systems
    and may trigger updates to the player's UI or party state. The method assumes
    that the packet data has already been validated at a lower level.
  warnings: Ensure that all player states are properly checked before calling this
    method, as it does not perform all validations internally. Improper handling of
    return values can lead to inconsistent group states in the game world.
