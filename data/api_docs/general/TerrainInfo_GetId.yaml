  method: GetId
  signature: uint32 TerrainInfo::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the terrain information object.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique identifier associated with a
    TerrainInfo object. This identifier is typically used to distinguish different
    terrain data instances within the game world, such as different zones or maps.
    The returned value is a 32-bit unsigned integer that serves as a key for identifying
    specific terrain configurations in TrinityCore's world management system. This
    method is commonly used when working with map-related data structures and terrain
    loading mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the terrain
    information object. This ID typically corresponds to a specific zone or map within
    the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TerrainInfo* terrain = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainInfo(0, 0);

      uint32 id = terrain->GetId();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Terrain ID: %u", id);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Map Context
    code: "Map* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);\nif (map)\n{\n    TerrainInfo* terrain\
      \ = map->GetTerrain();\n    if (terrain)\n    {\n        uint32 terrainId =\
      \ terrain->GetId();\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Current map\
      \ terrain ID: %u\", terrainId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that does not perform any expensive operations.
    It directly returns a cached value stored within the TerrainInfo object. The ID
    returned by this method should be stable throughout the lifetime of the terrain
    object and can be used for efficient lookups in terrain-related data structures.
