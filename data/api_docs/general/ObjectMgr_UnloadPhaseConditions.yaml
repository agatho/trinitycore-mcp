documentation:
  brief: Clears all phase condition data from memory
  description: The UnloadPhaseConditions method removes all loaded phase condition
    entries from the ObjectMgr's internal data structures. This function is typically
    called during server shutdown or when reloading phase data to ensure that stale
    phase conditions do not persist in memory. Phase conditions are used in World
    of Warcraft to determine which players can see certain objects, events, or areas
    based on various game state criteria such as quest progress, player level, or
    faction status. The method ensures clean memory management by freeing up resources
    associated with these conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage During Shutdown
    code: "void World::Shutdown()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->UnloadPhaseConditions();\n\
      \    // Other shutdown logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when it's safe to clear all phase conditions,
    typically during server initialization or shutdown sequences. It's important that
    no active game operations are using phase conditions when this method is invoked.
