  brief: Reward reputation to player based on quest completion
  description: The RewardReputation method handles the distribution of reputation
    points to a player when they complete a quest. This method is typically called
    internally by the game engine when a quest is completed, and it ensures that the
    player receives appropriate reputation rewards based on the quest's associated
    faction. The method automatically calculates and applies the reputation gain according
    to the quest's reputation requirements and the player's current standing with
    the relevant faction.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that was completed by the player. This
      parameter determines the reputation rewards and faction associated with the
      quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      Quest* quest = ...;

      player->RewardReputation(quest);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine when a quest
    is completed. It may also be called manually in certain circumstances, such as
    when a quest is completed via scripting or when a player's reputation needs to
    be adjusted manually.
  warnings: The method should only be called when the player has actually completed
    the quest. Calling this method without proper completion can lead to incorrect
    reputation gains and potentially cause issues with quest progression.
