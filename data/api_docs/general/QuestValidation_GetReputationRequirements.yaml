  signature: int QuestValidation::GetReputationRequirements(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reputation requirements for a specified quest
  description: The GetReputationRequirements method fetches the reputation threshold
    values required to accept and complete a specific quest. This method is typically
    used in the quest validation system to ensure players meet the necessary faction
    standing requirements before they can engage with the quest. It returns an integer
    value representing the reputation level needed, which corresponds to the minimum
    standing (e.g., Neutral, Friendly, Honored) required for the quest. The method
    does not validate whether the player currently meets these requirements; it only
    retrieves the configured values from the database or internal quest data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the reputation requirement level needed to access
    the quest. This value typically corresponds to standard World of Warcraft reputation
    levels such as 0 (Hated), 1 (Hostile), 2 (Unfriendly), 3 (Neutral), 4 (Friendly),
    5 (Honored), 6 (Revered), and 7 (Exalted). A return value of -1 may indicate that
    no reputation requirements are defined for the quest or an error occurred during
    retrieval.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest reputation requirement
    code: "int reqRep = sQuestValidation->GetReputationRequirements(12345);\nif (reqRep\
      \ >= 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Quest requires %d reputation level\\n\", reqRep);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No reputation requirement or error occurred\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the QuestValidation class and is likely used internally
    by the core quest system to enforce faction requirements. It assumes that the
    quest ID passed is valid and exists in the database. The returned integer value
    should be interpreted according to standard WoW reputation level mappings, where
    higher numbers indicate more prestigious standings.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter is valid before calling this method;
    passing an invalid or non-existent quest ID may result in undefined behavior or
    incorrect return values. This method does not perform any player-specific checks
    and should be used in conjunction with other validation methods to determine if
    a specific player meets the requirements.
