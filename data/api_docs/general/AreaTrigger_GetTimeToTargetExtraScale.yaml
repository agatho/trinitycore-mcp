  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetTimeToTargetExtraScale
  signature: uint32 AreaTrigger::GetTimeToTargetExtraScale() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the extra scaling time value associated with the area trigger's target.
  description: The GetTimeToTargetExtraScale method retrieves a uint32 value that
    represents additional time scaling applied to the area trigger's target duration
    or effect timing. This value is typically used in conjunction with area trigger
    mechanics to modify how long an effect lasts or when it triggers, particularly
    in scenarios involving dynamic scaling based on player actions, environmental
    factors, or spell modifiers. The returned value may be influenced by various game
    systems such as haste, time dilation effects, or custom server configurations.
    This method does not require any parameters and is read-only.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the extra scaling time applied to the area
    trigger's target. This value typically indicates a multiplier or offset used in
    timing calculations for the area trigger effect.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log the extra scale time
    code: 'uint32 extraScale = areaTrigger->GetTimeToTargetExtraScale();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("spell", "Area Trigger %u has extra scale time: %u", areaTrigger->GetGUID().GetCounter(),
      extraScale);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AreaTrigger class and should only be called on
    valid area trigger instances. The returned value may vary depending on active
    buffs, debuffs, or server settings affecting time scaling mechanics.
