  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: ShouldInterrupt
  signature: bool PvPCombatAI::ShouldInterrupt(int * player, int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should interrupt current spell casting to cast
    a new spell.
  description: The ShouldInterrupt method evaluates if the current spell being cast
    by the AI unit should be interrupted in favor of another spell. This is typically
    used during PvP combat scenarios where tactical decisions must be made about when
    to switch spells based on target conditions, threat levels, or incoming damage.
    The method checks various factors such as spell type, target status, and combat
    state to decide whether interruption is beneficial. It's part of the AI decision-making
    process in PvP situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current spell should be interrupted; false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that the AI should cancel its current spell cast
    and initiate a new one based on updated combat conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in PvP Combat
    code: "if (pvpAI->ShouldInterrupt()) {\n    // Interrupt current spell\n    unit->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during spell casting updates in the AI loop.
    It's important to note that this method may be overridden in derived classes for
    specific NPC or player behavior. The decision logic might consider factors like
    target health, spell damage type, and threat generation.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may lead to unexpected spell
    interruption behavior. Ensure that any spell interruption logic is consistent
    with the overall AI state and combat strategy. This method should not be used
    to interrupt spells that are critical for survival or have specific cooldown requirements.
