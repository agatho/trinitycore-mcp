  class: ArenaTeam
  method: SendStats
  signature: void ArenaTeam::SendStats(WorldSession * session)
documentation:
  brief: Sends arena team statistics to the specified session.
  description: The SendStats method retrieves and transmits the current statistical
    data of an arena team to a connected WorldSession. This includes information such
    as team rating, match history, member counts, and performance metrics. The method
    is typically invoked when a player requests arena team information or when the
    team's stats need to be refreshed in the client UI. It ensures that the player's
    client displays up-to-date arena team details, which are crucial for matchmaking
    and ranking purposes within the game.

  examples:
  - title: Sending Arena Team Stats to a Player Session
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    team->SendStats(session);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles serialization of arena team data and sends
    it through the WorldSession's packet system. It is expected that the ArenaTeam
    object has valid data and that the session is active before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling SendStats on a team with invalid or uninitialized data may result
    in incomplete or malformed packets being sent to the client, potentially causing
    UI glitches or disconnects.
