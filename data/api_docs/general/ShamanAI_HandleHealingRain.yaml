documentation:
  brief: Initiates or manages the Healing Rain spell casting behavior for a shaman
    AI.
  description: The HandleHealingRain method is responsible for managing the AI logic
    associated with the Healing Rain spell in a Shaman's combat behavior. This method
    typically evaluates whether the spell should be cast, selects appropriate targets
    within range, and handles the execution of the spell. It integrates with the shaman's
    overall healing strategy and may consider factors such as health percentages of
    nearby allies, mana availability, and threat levels. The method returns true if
    the spell was successfully initiated or queued for casting, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Healing Rain spell was successfully initiated or queued
    for casting; returns false if conditions were not met to cast the spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandleHealingRain()) {\n    // Spell casting started\n  \
      \  // Additional logic can be added here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the shaman AI's healing rotation and should typically
    be called during the AI update cycle. It may depend on internal state tracking
    for cooldowns, target selection, and mana levels.
