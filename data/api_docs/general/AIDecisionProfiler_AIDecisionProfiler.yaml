documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AIDecisionProfiler class for tracking AI
    decision-making performance.
  description: The AIDecisionProfiler constructor initializes a new instance of the
    AIDecisionProfiler class. This class is designed to monitor and profile the performance
    of AI decision-making processes within the TrinityCore framework. It typically
    sets up internal data structures for recording timing information, decision metrics,
    and performance statistics related to NPC behavior and AI logic execution. The
    profiler may be used during development or debugging to identify performance bottlenecks
    in AI decision trees, pathfinding algorithms, or combat behavior implementations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AIDecisionProfiler instance
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      // profiler is now initialized and ready to track AI decisions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not take any parameters, suggesting it may initialize
    default profiling behavior or rely on global configuration settings. The profiler
    likely maintains internal state for collecting timing data and performance metrics
    without requiring explicit initialization parameters.
