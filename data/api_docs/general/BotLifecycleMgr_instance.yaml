documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotLifecycleMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotLifecycleMgr
    class, providing global access to a single instance of the manager. This method
    ensures that only one BotLifecycleMgr object exists throughout the application
    lifecycle, centralizing bot lifecycle management operations. The returned pointer
    should be used to access all bot lifecycle related functionality such as creating,
    destroying, and managing bot instances within the TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotLifecycleMgr instance. The method never returns
    NULL as it creates the instance on first call if it doesn't exist yet.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotLifecycleMgr singleton
    code: 'BotLifecycleMgr* lifecycleMgr = BotLifecycleMgr::instance();

      // Use lifecycleMgr to manage bot lifecycles

      lifecycleMgr->CreateBot(playerGuid, botClass);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern implementation. The instance
    is created lazily on first access, and subsequent calls return the same instance.
    As a singleton, it's thread-safe in most TrinityCore contexts, but developers
    should verify thread safety requirements for specific use cases.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, be cautious about tight coupling with other
    systems. Avoid creating multiple instances or relying on global state in unit
    tests. The singleton pattern can make code harder to test and maintain if overused.
