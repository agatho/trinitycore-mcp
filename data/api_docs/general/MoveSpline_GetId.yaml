documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the movement spline.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique identifier associated with a
    MoveSpline instance. In TrinityCore's movement system, each MoveSpline represents
    a specific movement path for an object (such as a player or creature) and is assigned
    a unique ID to distinguish it from other splines. This ID is typically used internally
    by the server to track and manage active movements, particularly in scenarios
    involving complex pathfinding, waypoint following, or smooth locomotion animations.
    The returned value is a 32-bit unsigned integer that uniquely identifies this
    spline within the context of the movement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the MoveSpline
    instance. This ID is generated and managed internally by the movement system and
    should not be assumed to follow any predictable pattern or sequence.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log spline ID
    code: 'uint32 splineId = spline->GetId();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("movement", "Current spline ID: %u", splineId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Compare spline IDs for movement tracking
    code: "MoveSpline* currentSpline = unit->movespline;\nif (currentSpline && currentSpline->GetId()\
      \ != lastSplineId)\n{\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"movement\", \"Movement spline changed\
      \ from %u to %u\", lastSplineId, currentSpline->GetId());\n    lastSplineId\
      \ = currentSpline->GetId();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The MoveSpline ID is not guaranteed to be persistent across different movement
    events or sessions. It's primarily used for tracking active movements during runtime
    and may be reused after a spline completes or is destroyed. This method is safe
    to call from any thread that has access to the MoveSpline instance.
  warnings: Do not rely on the numerical value of the ID for logic decisions, as it's
    an internal identifier. The ID may change between different instances or movement
    states, and should only be used for identification purposes within the movement
    system.
