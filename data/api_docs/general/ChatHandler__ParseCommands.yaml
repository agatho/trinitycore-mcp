  class: ChatHandler
  method: _ParseCommands
  signature: bool ChatHandler::_ParseCommands(int text)
documentation:
  brief: Parses and executes chat commands entered by a player in the World of Warcraft
    client.
  description: The _ParseCommands method is responsible for processing incoming chat
    messages from players and determining whether they match any registered console
    or in-game commands. It evaluates the input text, identifies valid command prefixes
    (such as '/'), and routes the command to the appropriate handler function within
    the TrinityCore server framework. This method plays a crucial role in the game's
    interactive system, enabling players to use various administrative and gameplay
    commands directly through their chat interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the command was successfully parsed and executed; returns
    false if the input text does not correspond to a recognized command or if parsing
    failed for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Parsing
    code: "if (handler->_ParseCommands(12345)) {\n    // Command was successfully\
      \ parsed and executed\n} else {\n    // Invalid or unrecognized command\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the server's chat handling
    system after a player sends a message. It assumes that the input text has already
    been validated for basic formatting and character set compliance. Developers should
    be aware that this method may trigger database operations or network events depending
    on the command being executed.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with untrusted user input without proper
    sanitization, as it could lead to security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior
    if malformed commands are passed. The method does not perform any access control
    checks itself; it relies on higher-level systems to validate permissions.
