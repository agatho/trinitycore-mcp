documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the MapManager class
  description: The instance() method is a static accessor function that provides global
    access to the single MapManager object in the TrinityCore server. This method
    implements the singleton pattern, ensuring there is only one active MapManager
    instance throughout the application lifecycle. The returned pointer can be used
    to access all map-related functionality including map loading, unloading, and
    management operations. This is essential for managing world maps, instances, and
    their associated data structures in the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton MapManager instance. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access map manager
    code: "MapManager* mapMgr = MapManager::instance();\nMap* map = mapMgr->FindMap(0,\
      \ 0);\nif (map)\n{\n    // Perform operations on the map\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using instance in a game context
    code: "void HandlePlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    MapManager* mapMgr\
      \ = MapManager::instance();\n    Map* currentMap = player->GetMap();\n    \n\
      \    // Access global map data through singleton\n    if (currentMap && currentMap->IsDungeon())\n\
      \    {\n        InstanceMap* instanceMap = static_cast<InstanceMap*>(currentMap);\n\
      \        // Handle instance-specific logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is created during server
    initialization. The MapManager singleton should be accessed through this method
    rather than creating new instances directly. This pattern ensures consistent access
    to map data across all subsystems of the TrinityCore server.
  warnings: Do not attempt to manually delete or destroy the returned MapManager instance
    as it's managed by the singleton pattern. Avoid storing references to the singleton
    instance for extended periods as it may lead to issues if the server state changes
    unexpectedly.
