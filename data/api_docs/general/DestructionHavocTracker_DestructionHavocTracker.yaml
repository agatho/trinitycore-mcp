  method: DestructionHavocTracker
  signature: void DestructionHavocTracker::DestructionHavocTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the DestructionHavocTracker class for tracking
    destruction havoc mechanics.
  description: The DestructionHavocTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the DestructionHavocTracker class, which is designed to monitor and manage
    the state of destruction havoc effects within the World of Warcraft TrinityCore
    environment. This tracker typically handles the lifecycle of havoc-related game
    mechanics such as tracking active havoc buffs, managing their durations, and coordinating
    with other systems that respond to havoc events. The initialization process sets
    up internal data structures required for tracking havoc states and ensures proper
    integration with the core game loop and event system.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new DestructionHavocTracker instance
    code: 'DestructionHavocTracker* tracker = new DestructionHavocTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track havoc effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when initializing a new havoc tracking
    system. The tracker assumes it will be managed by the game's event system and
    may require additional setup through other methods before being fully functional.
