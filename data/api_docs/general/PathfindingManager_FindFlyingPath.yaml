  class: PathfindingManager
  method: FindFlyingPath
  signature: PathResult PathfindingManager::FindFlyingPath(const int & start, const
    int & goal)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a flying path between two given waypoints for creature
    movement.
  description: The FindFlyingPath method computes a valid flying route between two
    specified waypoints within the game world. It is primarily used by the PathfindingManager
    to generate paths for creatures that can fly, such as birds or certain NPCs. The
    method takes start and goal waypoint IDs and returns a PathResult object containing
    the computed path details including waypoints, cost, and success status. This
    functionality supports dynamic pathfinding in environments where creatures may
    need to navigate through complex terrain or avoid obstacles while maintaining
    flight capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The identifier of the starting waypoint for the flying path calculation.
  - name: goal
    description: The identifier of the destination waypoint for the flying path calculation.
  returns: A PathResult object that contains the computed flying path details, including
    waypoints, movement cost, and success status. Returns an invalid path if no valid
    route exists between the specified waypoints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindFlyingPath
    code: "PathResult result = pathfindingManager->FindFlyingPath(1001, 1005);\nif\
      \ (result.IsValid()) {\n    // Process valid flying path\n    for (auto& point\
      \ : result.GetWaypoints()) {\n        printf(\"Waypoint: %f, %f, %f\\n\", point.x,\
      \ point.y, point.z);\n    }\n} else {\n    printf(\"No valid flying path found\
      \ between waypoints.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on precomputed navigation data and assumes that both start
    and goal waypoints are valid and connected in the flight path network. The implementation
    may cache previously computed paths for performance optimization, especially in
    frequently traversed areas.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided waypoint IDs correspond to actual navigable points
    in the game world; invalid or disconnected waypoints will result in an invalid
    PathResult. This method should not be called from within critical sections of
    code due to potential blocking operations during path computation.
