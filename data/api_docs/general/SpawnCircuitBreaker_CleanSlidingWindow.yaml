  brief: Clears expired entries from the sliding window used for spawn circuit breaker
    logic
  description: The CleanSlidingWindow method removes outdated or expired entries from
    the internal sliding window data structure that tracks spawn activity. This mechanism
    is part of the spawn circuit breaker pattern designed to prevent excessive spawn
    requests from overwhelming the server. The method iterates through the window
    and purges entries that exceed their configured time threshold, ensuring the circuit
    breaker can accurately detect and respond to potential abuse or spam patterns
    in spawn operations.

    code: 'SpawnCircuitBreaker breaker;

      breaker.CleanSlidingWindow();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the circuit breaker's maintenance
    routine. It operates on a time-based sliding window where entries are considered
    expired after a configurable timeout period. The implementation assumes thread-safe
    access to the underlying data structure.
