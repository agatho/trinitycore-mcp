  brief: Initializes all outdoor PvP systems and registers them with the game manager.
  description: The InitOutdoorPvP method is responsible for setting up and initializing
    all Outdoor PvP (Player vs Player) systems within the TrinityCore server. This
    method typically iterates through registered OutdoorPvP zones and prepares them
    for gameplay, including loading configuration data, setting up event handlers,
    and ensuring that the PvP mechanics are properly integrated into the game world.
    It is usually called during server startup or when the game manager initializes
    its outdoor PvP subsystems. The method ensures that all outdoor PvP zones are
    ready to handle player interactions and combat events.
