  signature: void SocialManager::SetAutoRespond(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the automatic response feature for social interactions
    in the game.
  description: The SetAutoRespond method controls whether a player's character automatically
    responds to incoming friend requests, guild invitations, or other social messages.
    When enabled, the character will automatically accept certain types of social
    communications without manual intervention. This feature is commonly used by players
    who want to streamline their social interactions or maintain an active presence
    in guilds and communities. The method does not validate the current state of the
    player's social settings beyond toggling this specific behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto Respond
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SetAutoRespond(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto Respond
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SetAutoRespond(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the automatic response behavior and does not modify
    other social settings such as ignore lists or friend request limits. The feature
    may be overridden by server-side configurations or account restrictions.
  warnings: Enabling auto-respond can lead to unintended acceptance of invitations
    or messages from unknown players, potentially exposing the character to spam or
    unwanted interactions.
