  method: HasActivePet
  signature: bool BeastMasteryPetManager::HasActivePet() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has an active beast mastery pet summoned.
  description: The HasActivePet method determines if the player currently has a valid,
    active beast mastery pet summoned in the world. This is typically used to verify
    that a pet exists and is in a usable state before performing actions that require
    an active pet. The method checks internal pet management state within the BeastMasteryPetManager
    class, ensuring the pet is not only summoned but also considered active according
    to game logic. It does not validate pet health or other dynamic states beyond
    existence and summoning status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a beast mastery pet is currently active and summoned; otherwise
    returns false if no pet exists, has been dismissed, or is otherwise inactive.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for active pet
    code: "if (player->GetBeastMasteryPetManager()->HasActivePet()) {\n    // Perform\
      \ actions that require an active pet\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_BEAST_MASTERY_ABILITY);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where no pet is active\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You must summon a pet first.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the BeastMasteryPetManager
    and assumes that pet management logic properly updates this state when pets are
    summoned or dismissed. It may not reflect real-time changes in pet status during
    combat or other dynamic events without explicit updates.
