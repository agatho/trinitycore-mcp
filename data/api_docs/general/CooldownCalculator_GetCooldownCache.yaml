  class: CooldownCalculator
  method: GetCooldownCache
  signature: int & CooldownCalculator::GetCooldownCache()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the internal cooldown cache integer value used for
    tracking spell or ability cooldowns.
  description: The GetCooldownCache method provides access to an internal integer
    cache that stores the current cooldown state or remaining time for spells and
    abilities within the TrinityCore framework. This cache is typically used to optimize
    performance by avoiding repeated calculations of cooldown durations. The returned
    reference allows direct modification of the cached value, which can be useful
    in custom cooldown handling logic or when syncing cooldown states with external
    systems. The method does not perform any validation on the cached value, so developers
    should ensure proper initialization and management of this cache.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the current cooldown cache value.
    This value typically represents either a cooldown duration in milliseconds or
    a state indicator depending on implementation context.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing and modifying cooldown cache
    code: 'CooldownCalculator calculator;

      int& cacheRef = calculator.GetCooldownCache();

      cacheRef = 3000; // Set cooldown to 3 seconds

      int currentCooldown = calculator.GetCooldownCache(); // Retrieve current value'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a direct reference to an internal member variable, which
    means modifications affect the object's state directly. The cache may be updated
    by other methods in the class or through game events, so frequent access without
    proper synchronization might lead to unexpected behavior in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Modifying the returned reference directly can have side effects on cooldown
    calculations throughout the system. Ensure that any changes made to this value
    are consistent with expected cooldown mechanics and do not introduce desynchronization
    between client and server states.
