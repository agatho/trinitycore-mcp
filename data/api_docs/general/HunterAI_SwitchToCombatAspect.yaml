  signature: void HunterAI::SwitchToCombatAspect()
documentation:
  brief: Switches the hunter to a combat aspect, activating the appropriate pet behavior
    and attack mode.
  description: The SwitchToCombatAspect method is responsible for transitioning a
    hunter's AI from a non-combat state to an active combat state. This involves activating
    the hunter's pet, setting the proper attack mode, and ensuring that the hunter's
    AI is ready to engage in combat. The method typically checks if the hunter has
    a pet available and ensures that the pet is properly initialized before switching
    to combat mode. It may also handle the activation of specific hunter abilities
    or stances related to combat readiness.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_creature->IsInCombat())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    if (m_creature->GetVictim() && !m_creature->GetVictim()->IsAlive())\n\
      \        m_creature->CombatStop();\n\n    if (m_creature->GetVictim())\n   \
      \ {\n        SwitchToCombatAspect();\n        // Additional combat logic\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a hunter
    enters combat. Developers should ensure that any pet-related functionality is
    properly initialized before calling this method, as it may rely on the presence
    of a valid pet.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the hunter has an active pet may
    result in undefined behavior or errors. It's recommended to verify pet status
    before invoking SwitchToCombatAspect.
