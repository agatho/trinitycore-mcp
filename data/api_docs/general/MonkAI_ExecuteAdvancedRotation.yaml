  class: MonkAI
  method: ExecuteAdvancedRotation
  signature: void MonkAI::ExecuteAdvancedRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the advanced combat rotation logic for a Monk AI, determining optimal
    ability usage based on current game state and target conditions.
  description: The ExecuteAdvancedRotation method implements the core decision-making
    logic for a Monk's AI behavior. It evaluates the current combat situation, including
    health percentages, resource levels, enemy status effects, and positional data
    to determine which abilities should be cast next. This method is typically called
    during the AI's update cycle and integrates with the broader TrinityCore framework
    to ensure proper spell casting, cooldown management, and tactical positioning.
    The method modifies internal state variables and may influence the Monk's target
    selection or movement patterns based on strategic gameplay considerations.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier for the
      current combat engagement. This value is used to fetch target information from
      the AI's internal target tracking system and determine appropriate ability usage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        ExecuteAdvancedRotation(&targetId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already established a valid combat target
    and that all necessary game state information is accessible. It may perform multiple
    internal checks before executing any actions, including cooldown validation, resource
    availability, and spell range requirements.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect ability selection. The method should only be called when a valid
    combat target exists to avoid potential null pointer dereferences or invalid game
    state modifications.
