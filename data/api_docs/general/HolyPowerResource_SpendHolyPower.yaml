  class: HolyPowerResource
  method: SpendHolyPower
  signature: bool HolyPowerResource::SpendHolyPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Spends the specified amount of holy power from the resource.
  description: The SpendHolyPower method reduces the current holy power value by the
    given amount if sufficient resources are available. This method is typically used
    by classes such as Paladins or Priests who consume holy power for special abilities.
    The method performs a check to ensure that the requested amount does not exceed
    the current resource level before deducting it. If the operation succeeds, the
    holy power is consumed and the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false
    without modifying the resource.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of holy power to be spent. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the amount to deduct from the current holy power resource.
  returns: True if the specified amount of holy power was successfully deducted from
    the resource; false if there was insufficient holy power or if the amount requested
    was invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetHolyPowerResource()->SpendHolyPower(3)) {\n    // Holy power\
      \ successfully spent\n    // Proceed with ability activation\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Before Spending
    code: "uint32 requiredPower = 5;\nif (player->GetHolyPowerResource()->GetHolyPower()\
      \ >= requiredPower) {\n    if (player->GetHolyPowerResource()->SpendHolyPower(requiredPower))\
      \ {\n        // Activate ability that costs 5 holy power\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the resource has sufficient holy power to be spent. It
    does not perform any validation beyond checking whether the requested amount is
    less than or equal to the current holy power level. The method should only be
    called on valid HolyPowerResource instances.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the current holy power
    will result in a failed spend attempt and no change to the resource. Ensure that
    sufficient holy power exists before calling to avoid unexpected behavior.
