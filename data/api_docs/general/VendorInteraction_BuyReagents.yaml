  class: VendorInteraction
  method: BuyReagents
  signature: InteractionResult VendorInteraction::BuyReagents(Player * bot, Creature
    * vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the purchase of reagents from a vendor by a bot player.
  description: The BuyReagents method handles the logic for a bot player to buy reagent
    items from a creature vendor. It evaluates the bot's inventory, checks available
    reagents in the vendor's inventory, and performs the transaction if sufficient
    funds and space are available. This method is typically used in automated bot
    behavior systems where players or NPCs need to replenish crafting materials. The
    method ensures proper currency deduction, item addition to inventory, and maintains
    consistency with World of Warcraft's trading mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will purchase
      reagents from the vendor.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor from whom
      reagents are being purchased.
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum indicating the success or failure of
    the reagent purchasing operation. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILURE, INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS,
    INVENTORY_FULL, or VENDOR_UNAVAILABLE.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reagent Purchase
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nInteractionResult result =\
      \ VendorInteraction::BuyReagents(bot, vendor);\nif (result == SUCCESS) {\n \
      \   // Reagents purchased successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Different Purchase Results
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nInteractionResult result =\
      \ VendorInteraction::BuyReagents(bot, vendor);\nswitch (result) {\n    case\
      \ SUCCESS:\n        // Process successful purchase\n        break;\n    case\
      \ INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS:\n        // Handle lack of gold\n        break;\n    case\
      \ INVENTORY_FULL:\n        // Handle full inventory\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Handle other failure cases\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player and vendor are within valid interaction
    range. The implementation may involve checking vendor availability, item availability
    in vendor's inventory, and player's currency balance. It is recommended to validate
    that both parameters are non-null before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player has sufficient gold and inventory space before
    calling this method to avoid unnecessary processing. This method does not perform
    any automatic inventory management or currency validation beyond basic checks.
