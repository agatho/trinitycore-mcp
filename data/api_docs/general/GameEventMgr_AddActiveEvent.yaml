documentation:
  brief: Activates a game event by adding it to the active events list.
  description: The AddActiveEvent method marks a specified game event as active within
    the GameEventMgr system. This function is typically used during event initialization
    or activation phases to ensure that the event's conditions, spawns, and modifications
    are properly applied to the game world. The method updates internal tracking structures
    to reflect that the event is now active, which may trigger related systems such
    as quest updates, NPC spawning, or object modifications depending on how the event
    is configured. This method does not validate whether the event ID exists; it simply
    adds the event to the list of currently active events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activating a Game Event
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->AddActiveEvent(42);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is generally called internally by the game event system when
    an event is triggered or begins. Developers should not call this directly unless
    implementing custom event logic. The method assumes that the event ID passed is
    valid and corresponds to a registered event in the system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent event ID may lead
    to undefined behavior or inconsistent game state if other systems rely on the
    event being properly initialized. Ensure all event IDs are validated before calling
    this function.
