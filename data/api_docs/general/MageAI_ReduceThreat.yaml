  signature: void MageAI::ReduceThreat()
documentation:
  brief: Reduces threat generated by the Mage AI unit.
  description: The ReduceThreat method is used to lower the threat level that a Mage
    AI unit has accumulated towards enemies. This functionality is typically employed
    during spell casting or when the AI needs to avoid aggro from nearby hostile targets.
    The method modifies internal threat values within the MageAI class, ensuring that
    the AI does not provoke unwanted attention from mobs. It's commonly called before
    casting spells that may increase threat, or when the AI is attempting to maintain
    a lower threat state for tactical reasons.

    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        ReduceThreat();\n    // Other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the threat manager system in TrinityCore
    to adjust the unit's threat table. It may be called automatically by internal
    AI systems or manually during specific spell sequences.
