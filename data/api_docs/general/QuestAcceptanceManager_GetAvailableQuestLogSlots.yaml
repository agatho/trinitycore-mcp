documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of available quest log slots for the player
  description: The GetAvailableQuestLogSlots method retrieves the count of empty quest
    log slots currently available for the player to accept new quests. This value
    represents the maximum number of quests that can be active in the player's quest
    log at any given time, which is determined by the player's level, class, and any
    applicable modifiers such as quest log size bonuses or temporary increases. The
    method does not modify any state and simply returns the current available slot
    count. This information is crucial for determining whether a player can accept
    new quests without exceeding their quest log capacity.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of empty quest log slots currently available
    for the player to accept new quests. Returns 0 if no slots are available, or a
    positive integer indicating the number of free slots.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Quest Slots Before Accepting Quest
    code: "if (questManager->GetAvailableQuestLogSlots() > 0)\n{\n    // Player can\
      \ accept a new quest\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Inform\
      \ player that quest log is full\n    player->SendNotification(\"Your quest log\
      \ is full.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method reflects the current state of the player's quest log and may
    change dynamically based on quest completion, quest removal, or other game events.
    The returned value should be checked before attempting to add new quests to prevent
    exceeding the maximum quest log capacity.
