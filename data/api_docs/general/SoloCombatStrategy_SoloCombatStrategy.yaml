documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the SoloCombatStrategy class for handling single-player
    combat behaviors.
  description: The SoloCombatStrategy constructor initializes a new instance of the
    SoloCombatStrategy class, which is designed to manage AI behavior for solo player
    combat scenarios within the TrinityCore framework. This strategy typically handles
    decision-making processes such as target selection, spell casting, movement patterns,
    and combat tactics when a player is engaged in combat without group support. The
    initialization process sets up internal state variables and configuration parameters
    necessary for effective solo combat management. This class is part of the broader
    AI system that governs non-player character behavior and player-controlled unit
    actions in World of Warcraft environments.

  - title: Creating a SoloCombatStrategy instance
    code: 'SoloCombatStrategy* strategy = new SoloCombatStrategy();

      // The strategy object is now ready to be used for solo combat AI decisions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It primarily sets up default values and internal state required for
    the combat strategy logic. Developers should ensure that any necessary configuration
    or setup occurs after construction, as this method only performs basic object
    initialization.
