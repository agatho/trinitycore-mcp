documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is triggered by another spell or effect.
  description: The IsTriggered method checks if a spell is classified as a triggered
    spell, meaning it was cast as a result of another spell or effect rather than
    being directly cast by the player. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft
    to identify spells that are automatically activated when certain conditions are
    met, such as when a player gains a buff or when specific abilities are triggered
    by other effects. The method returns true if the spell is marked as triggered,
    false otherwise. This functionality is essential for managing spell interactions
    and determining whether a spell should be processed in special ways during gameplay
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is triggered by another effect or spell; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->IsTriggered()) {\n    // Handle triggered spell logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine the behavior of spells during gameplay. It's important to note that
    triggered spells may have different execution paths compared to regular spells,
    particularly when it comes to cooldowns and resource consumption.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other spell properties like IsSpellAllowed
    or IsSpellDisabled, which are used for different purposes in spell management.
    Misusing this method can lead to incorrect spell behavior during gameplay.
