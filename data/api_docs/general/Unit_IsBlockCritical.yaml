  class: Unit
  method: IsBlockCritical
  signature: bool Unit::IsBlockCritical() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit's block is critical.
  description: This method checks if the unit's block is critical, meaning that the
    block will result in a critical strike. It is used to determine if the unit's
    block chance is enhanced by critical strike mechanics, typically affecting the
    outcome of block events during combat. This method is part of the general unit
    functionality and can be used in various combat scenarios where block mechanics
    are relevant.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit's block is critical, false otherwise. The return
    value indicates whether a block event will trigger a critical strike based on
    the unit's current critical block chance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsBlockCritical()) {\n    // Block will result in critical strike\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    to determine the outcome of block events. It requires that the unit has a valid
    block chance and may be affected by various buffs or debuffs that modify block
    criticality.
  warnings: This method should not be used in isolation; it is best used in combination
    with other combat mechanics to fully understand block behavior. Be aware that
    block criticality can vary based on player class, gear, and other factors.
