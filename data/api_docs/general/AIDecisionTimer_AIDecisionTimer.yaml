  brief: Moves an AIDecisionTimer object to another AIDecisionTimer object using move
    semantics.
  description: The AIDecisionTimer constructor is a move constructor that transfers
    ownership of resources from one AIDecisionTimer instance to another. This is part
    of the standard C++ move semantics implementation, allowing efficient resource
    transfer without copying. The source object becomes invalid after the move operation
    and should not be used. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this constructor
    likely handles moving timer data or state between AI decision-making components
    during object lifecycle management.

  examples:
  - title: Move AIDecisionTimer to new variable
    code: 'AIDecisionTimer timer1;

      // ... initialize timer1 ...

      AIDecisionTimer timer2 = std::move(timer1); // Move constructor called

      // timer1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a regular constructor. It should only be
    used with rvalue expressions or explicitly moved objects. After the move, the
    source object's state is undefined and must not be accessed.
  warnings: Using this constructor on an already moved-from object or accessing the
    source object after moving will result in undefined behavior. Ensure proper use
    of std::move() when invoking this constructor.
