  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: EndInteraction
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::EndInteraction()
documentation:
  brief: Ends an active NPC interaction and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The EndInteraction method terminates the current NPC interaction session
    for a player, releasing any held references or state information related to the
    interaction. This method is typically called when a player has completed their
    interaction with an NPC, such as after completing a quest or finishing a dialogue
    sequence. It ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures and may trigger
    additional game logic like updating quest progress or notifying other systems
    about the interaction's conclusion. The method returns true if the interaction
    was successfully ended, or false if no active interaction was found to terminate.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the NPC interaction was successfully ended, or false if
    there was no active interaction to end.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->EndInteraction()) {\n    // Interaction\
      \ successfully ended\n    player->SendNotification(\"Interaction completed.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // No active interaction found\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      No active interaction to end.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when an NPC interaction is actively in
    progress. Calling it outside of an interaction may result in a no-op or unexpected
    behavior. The method internally handles cleanup of temporary data and ensures
    that the player's interaction state is properly reset.
  warnings: Calling EndInteraction without verifying that an interaction is active
    can lead to undefined behavior or silent failures. Always ensure that an interaction
    is in progress before calling this method.
