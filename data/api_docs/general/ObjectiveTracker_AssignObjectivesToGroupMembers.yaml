  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: AssignObjectivesToGroupMembers
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::AssignObjectivesToGroupMembers(Group * group,
    uint32 questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a specific quest objective to all members of a group.
  description: The AssignObjectivesToGroupMembers method distributes a given quest
    objective to all players within a specified group. This functionality is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to ensure that group members
    are synchronized with the same quest progress or objective requirements. The method
    operates on a provided Group object and assigns the specified quest objective
    index to each group member, which may involve updating their quest log or objective
    tracking state. It is commonly invoked when a group leader initiates a quest or
    when objectives need to be shared among group members for cooperative gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will receive
      the quest objective. Must not be null and must represent a valid group with
      at least one member.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which the objective is being
      assigned. This ID corresponds to an existing quest in the game database.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index of the specific objective within the quest that should
      be assigned to group members. Zero-based indexing is assumed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Quest Objective to Group Members
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    ObjectiveTracker::AssignObjectivesToGroupMembers(myGroup,\
      \ 12345, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal quest tracking system and
    may send updates to clients via network packets. It is expected to be called primarily
    from game logic that handles group-based quest progression.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior. Also, verify that the questId
    and objectiveIndex are valid indices to prevent runtime errors.
