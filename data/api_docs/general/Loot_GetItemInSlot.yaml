documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a loot item from the loot list by its identifier.
  description: The GetItemInSlot method retrieves a specific LootItem from the internal
    loot list using the provided lootListId. This method is typically used during
    loot distribution to access individual items that have been added to a player's
    loot window. The returned pointer provides direct access to the item's properties
    such as item ID, stack count, and loot quality. It is important to note that this
    method does not perform any validation on the provided lootListId, so calling
    it with an invalid index may result in undefined behavior or a null pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the LootItem object corresponding to the specified lootListId,
    or nullptr if the lootListId is invalid or no item exists at that index.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing a specific loot item
    code: "LootItem const* item = loot->GetItemInSlot(0);\nif (item)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ itemId = item->itemid;\n    uint32 itemCount = item->count;\n    // Process\
      \ the item\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating through all loot items
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < loot->GetItemCount(); ++i)\n{\n    LootItem const*\
      \ item = loot->GetItemInSlot(i);\n    if (item)\n    {\n        // Process each\
      \ item\n        sLog->outString(\"Item ID: %u, Count: %u\", item->itemid, item->count);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides direct access to internal loot data structures. It should
    be used carefully as modifying the returned LootItem directly can affect the loot
    distribution process. The method assumes that the lootListId is valid and within
    the bounds of the current loot list size.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid lootListId may return a null pointer
    or cause undefined behavior. Always validate the return value before using it.
    Do not modify the returned LootItem directly as it affects the internal loot state.
