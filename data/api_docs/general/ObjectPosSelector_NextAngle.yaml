  class: ObjectPosSelector

  signature: bool ObjectPosSelector::NextAngle(float & angle)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the next available angle for object positioning within
    a selector.
  description: The NextAngle method is used to determine the next suitable angular
    position when placing objects in a specific area. It typically works in conjunction
    with other methods of the ObjectPosSelector class to ensure proper spatial distribution
    of game entities such as NPCs, items, or effects. The method updates the internal
    state of the selector and returns true if a valid angle was found, false otherwise.
    This functionality is commonly used during spawning logic where objects need to
    be positioned without overlapping or in predefined patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid next angle was calculated and assigned to the provided
    reference parameter; returns false if no more angles are available or if the selector
    has reached its limit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of NextAngle
    code: "float angle;\nif (selector.NextAngle(angle))\n{\n    // Use the calculated\
      \ angle for positioning\n    printf(\"Next angle: %f\\n\", angle);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // No more angles available\n    printf(\"No more angles to select.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the ObjectPosSelector, so repeated
    calls will yield different results until all possible angles are exhausted. It's
    important to ensure that the selector is properly initialized before calling this
    method.
