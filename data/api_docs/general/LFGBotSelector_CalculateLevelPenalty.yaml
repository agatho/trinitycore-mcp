  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: CalculateLevelPenalty
  signature: uint32 LFGBotSelector::CalculateLevelPenalty(uint8 botLevel, uint8 desiredLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the level penalty for a bot based on the difference between its
    level and the desired level.
  description: 'The CalculateLevelPenalty method computes a penalty value that represents
    how much a bot''s effectiveness or eligibility is reduced when its level differs
    from the desired level for a group. This mechanism is used in LFG (Looking For
    Group) systems to balance player participation across different level ranges.
    The penalty typically increases as the level difference grows, discouraging players
    from joining groups that are significantly above or below their own level. The
    method takes two parameters: the bot''s current level and the desired level for
    the group, returning a uint32 value representing the calculated penalty.'
  parameters:
  - name: botLevel
    description: The current level of the bot (1-80). Represents the character's advancement
      in the game.
  - name: desiredLevel
    description: The target level for the group or activity (1-80). Used to determine
      how far the bot is from the ideal level range.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated level penalty. Higher values
    indicate a greater mismatch between bot level and desired level, which may affect
    the bot's selection priority or effectiveness in LFG scenarios.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 penalty = selector.CalculateLevelPenalty(10, 20); // Returns a penalty
      for a level 10 bot joining a level 20 group
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing penalties for different level differences
    code: 'uint32 lowPenalty = selector.CalculateLevelPenalty(50, 52);   // Small
      difference

      uint32 highPenalty = selector.CalculateLevelPenalty(50, 65);   // Large difference'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the LFGBotSelector to prioritize
    bots for group matching. The exact formula for calculating the penalty is not
    specified in the signature but would typically involve a mathematical function
    such as exponential decay or linear scaling based on level difference.
  warnings: Ensure that both botLevel and desiredLevel are within valid game level
    ranges (typically 1-80) to avoid unexpected behavior or overflow issues. The returned
    penalty value should be interpreted in context of the overall LFG system logic.
