  class: AuraEffect
  method: GetTotalTicks
  signature: uint32 AuraEffect::GetTotalTicks() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of ticks an aura effect will apply over its duration.
  description: The GetTotalTicks method retrieves the cumulative number of times an
    aura effect will tick during its active duration. This value is typically determined
    by the aura's duration and tick interval, representing how many times the effect's
    periodic application will occur. In World of Warcraft mechanics, this is crucial
    for understanding how often a buff or debuff will trigger its effects, such as
    damage over time (DoT) spells or healing over time (HoT) effects. The returned
    value accounts for all ticks including the initial application and any subsequent
    periodic ticks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of ticks that will occur during
    the aura's duration. This includes the initial tick if applicable, and all subsequent
    periodic ticks. Returns 0 if the aura has no tickable effects or is not active.
  examples:
  - title: Check Total Ticks for a DoT Aura
    code: "AuraEffect* auraEffect = player->GetAuraEffect(12345, 0);\nif (auraEffect)\n\
      {\n    uint32 totalTicks = auraEffect->GetTotalTicks();\n    std::cout << \"\
      This DoT will tick \" << totalTicks << \" times.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate Remaining Ticks Based on Current Tick
    code: "AuraEffect* auraEffect = player->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_ID, 0);\nif (auraEffect)\n\
      {\n    uint32 totalTicks = auraEffect->GetTotalTicks();\n    uint32 currentTick\
      \ = auraEffect->GetTickNumber();\n    uint32 remainingTicks = totalTicks - currentTick;\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Remaining ticks: \" << remainingTicks << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with GetTickNumber() to determine
    the progress of an aura's tick cycle. The total ticks value may be influenced
    by factors such as aura stacking, duration modifications, and spell properties.
    For auras that do not have periodic effects, this method will return 0.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned tick count is based on the aura's initial configuration
    and may not reflect dynamic changes during runtime. If an aura is refreshed or
    modified while active, the total ticks value might not update accordingly unless
    explicitly recalculated.
