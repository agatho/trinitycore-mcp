  class: MageAI
  method: UseBlizzard
  signature: void MageAI::UseBlizzard(const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Blizzard spell ability for the Mage AI, targeting a specified
    number of enemies.
  description: The UseBlizzard method is responsible for activating the Blizzard spell
    within the Mage AI's decision-making framework. This method determines the appropriate
    action to take when the Mage AI decides to use the Blizzard ability, which typically
    involves casting the spell on multiple targets within range. The method takes
    an integer parameter representing the number of enemies currently detected in
    the AI's vicinity, allowing it to adjust its behavior based on threat levels and
    crowd control requirements. This function is part of the Mage's core combat AI
    logic and integrates with the overall spell selection and targeting system.
  parameters:
  - name: enemies
    description: An integer reference representing the number of enemies currently
      detected within the Mage AI's threat range. This value determines how many targets
      the Blizzard spell will affect, typically up to a maximum of 4 enemies depending
      on the spell's configuration and the AI's current combat situation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void SomeMageAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    int enemyCount = GetEnemyCount();\n    if (enemyCount > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        UseBlizzard(enemyCount);\n    }\n    // ... other logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Blizzard Usage Based on Enemy Density
    code: "void MageAI::HandleCombat()\n{\n    int enemies = GetNearbyEnemyCount();\n\
      \    if (enemies >= 3)\n    {\n        UseBlizzard(enemies);\n    }\n    else\
      \ if (enemies >= 1)\n    {\n        // Alternative spell usage\n        UseFrostNova();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the Mage AI's main combat update
    loop. The implementation likely includes checks for spell cooldowns, mana requirements,
    and line-of-sight conditions before executing the Blizzard spell. The enemy count
    parameter should be validated to ensure it represents a realistic number of targets
    (typically between 1-4 for standard Blizzard mechanics).
  warnings: Ensure that the enemy count parameter is properly calculated and does
    not exceed the maximum number of targets Blizzard can affect. Calling this method
    without proper validation may result in invalid spell targeting or game state
    inconsistencies.
