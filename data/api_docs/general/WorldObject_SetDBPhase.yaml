api:
  class: WorldObject
  method: SetDBPhase
  signature: void WorldObject::SetDBPhase(int32 p)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the database phase value for this WorldObject, affecting its visibility
    and interaction in different phases.
  description: The SetDBPhase method updates the phase mask stored in the database
    for the WorldObject. This phase mask determines which game phases the object is
    active in, controlling visibility and interaction with players based on their
    current phase. The method typically updates both the internal phase state and
    persists it to the database so that the object's phase settings are maintained
    across server restarts. This functionality is crucial for implementing phased
    content such as seasonal events, world PvP zones, or instance-specific objects
    that should only be visible during certain game states.
  parameters:
  - name: p
    description: The phase ID to set for this WorldObject. Phase IDs are typically
      defined in the game's phase system and correspond to specific game events or
      zones. Valid values are usually non-negative integers representing active phases,
      with 0 often meaning 'no phase' or 'all phases'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a WorldObject to Phase 5
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = ...;

      obj->SetDBPhase(5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a GameObject to No Phase (Default)
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      go->SetDBPhase(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method updates both the in-memory phase state and writes it to the database.
    It should be called carefully as frequent changes may impact performance. The
    phase ID must be valid according to the game's phase system configuration.
  warnings: Setting an invalid or non-existent phase ID may cause unexpected behavior
    or errors. Ensure that the phase value corresponds to a defined phase in the server's
    phase system before calling this method.
