  class: AuctionHouse
  method: CalculateReasonableBid
  signature: uint32 AuctionHouse::CalculateReasonableBid(const AuctionItem & auction,
    float aggressiveness)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a reasonable bid amount for an auction item based on its current
    state and aggressiveness factor.
  description: The CalculateReasonableBid method determines an appropriate bid value
    for an auction item by analyzing the item's starting price, current highest bid
    (if any), and applying a mathematical formula influenced by the aggressiveness
    parameter. This function is used to provide players with intelligent bid suggestions
    when placing bids on items in the auction house system. The aggressiveness factor
    controls how aggressively the system suggests bidding; higher values result in
    bids closer to the item's maximum possible value, while lower values suggest more
    conservative bids. The method ensures that calculated bids are always valid and
    within the bounds of the auction rules.
  parameters:
  - name: auction
    description: Reference to the AuctionItem object representing the item being bid
      on. This contains all relevant information about the auction including current
      bid, starting price, and item details.
  - name: aggressiveness
    description: Float value between 0.0 and 1.0 that determines how aggressive the
      suggested bid should be. A value of 0.0 suggests a very conservative bid (close
      to current highest bid), while 1.0 suggests an aggressive bid (closer to maximum
      possible value).
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated reasonable bid amount
    in copper coins. This value is always at least equal to the current highest bid
    plus the minimum bid increment, and never exceeds the item's maximum possible
    bid limit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with default aggressiveness
    code: 'AuctionItem auctionItem;

      // ... populate auctionItem with data ...

      uint32 reasonableBid = auctionHouse->CalculateReasonableBid(auctionItem, 0.5f);

      printf("Recommended bid: %u copper\n", reasonableBid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using high aggressiveness for competitive bidding
    code: "AuctionItem auctionItem;\n// ... populate auctionItem with data ...\nuint32\
      \ aggressiveBid = auctionHouse->CalculateReasonableBid(auctionItem, 0.9f);\n\
      if (aggressiveBid > auctionItem.GetBid()) {\n    printf(\"Suggesting aggressive\
      \ bid: %u copper\\n\", aggressiveBid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the auction item's state or place any bids. It
    only calculates and returns a suggested bid value. The calculation considers both
    the item's starting price and current highest bid to determine a reasonable increment.
    Implementation uses floating-point arithmetic internally which may introduce minor
    rounding differences between different system architectures.
  warnings: The returned bid amount should not be directly used as an actual bid without
    first validating against the auction's current state, as another player might
    have placed a bid in the meantime. The aggressiveness parameter must be within
    [0.0, 1.0] range to avoid unexpected behavior or invalid calculations.
