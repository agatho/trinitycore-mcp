documentation:
  brief: Initializes the WorldBossAI behavior for a creature.
  description: The WorldBossAI constructor initializes the AI behavior specific to
    world boss creatures in TrinityCore. This method sets up the necessary AI framework
    and state management for boss encounters, including handling combat logic, phase
    transitions, and interaction with the game's event system. The initialization
    typically occurs when a world boss creature is spawned or loaded into the world,
    preparing it for its role in scripted boss encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic WorldBossAI Initialization
    code: "class MyWorldBoss : public Creature\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeAI()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Call the base AI initialization\n        WorldBossAI::WorldBossAI();\n\
      \        // Additional boss-specific setup can follow\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a creature with WorldBossAI behavior is created. Developers should not directly
    instantiate WorldBossAI objects but rather inherit from it or use the proper AI
    system initialization methods.
  warnings: Direct usage of this constructor outside of the AI framework context may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that the creature object
    has already been properly initialized with valid data before calling.
