  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ItemComparisonResult class with default
    values.
  description: The ItemComparisonResult constructor initializes a new instance of
    the ItemComparisonResult class, setting up internal state for storing and managing
    item comparison results. This class is typically used within the TrinityCore framework
    to handle comparisons between different items, such as when evaluating which item
    provides better stats or benefits for a player character. The constructor ensures
    that all member variables are properly initialized to their default states, making
    the object ready for use in item evaluation processes. It does not require any
    parameters and performs no complex operations beyond basic initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'ItemComparisonResult result;

      // The result object is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating a new ItemComparisonResult
    object on the stack or heap. Developers should be aware that this class may be
    used extensively during item evaluation processes within the game's inventory
    and character management systems.
