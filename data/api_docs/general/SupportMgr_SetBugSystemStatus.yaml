  class: SupportMgr
  method: SetBugSystemStatus
  signature: void SupportMgr::SetBugSystemStatus(bool status)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the bug reporting system within the TrinityCore server.
  description: The SetBugSystemStatus method controls whether players can submit bug
    reports through the in-game interface. When enabled, players can access the bug
    report feature to log issues they encounter during gameplay. When disabled, the
    bug report functionality is hidden from players and no new bug reports can be
    submitted. This method directly affects the server's configuration state related
    to user feedback collection and debugging support.
  parameters:
  - name: status
    description: Boolean value indicating the desired state of the bug system. True
      enables the bug reporting system, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Bug System
    code: SupportMgr::SetBugSystemStatus(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bug System
    code: SupportMgr::SetBugSystemStatus(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates an internal server configuration flag that is
    checked by the bug report UI and submission logic. Changes made using this method
    are typically persistent across server restarts if stored in the database or configuration
    files.
  warnings: Modifying the bug system status may affect player experience and support
    workflows. Ensure that disabling the system doesn't prevent legitimate bug reporting
    during critical maintenance periods.
