documentation:
  brief: Reloads the trade configuration settings for player bots from the database
    or configuration files.
  description: The Reload method updates the internal trade configuration data used
    by player bot AI systems. This method is typically invoked when configuration
    changes need to be applied without restarting the server. It refreshes settings
    such as trade thresholds, item preferences, and negotiation behaviors that govern
    how player bots conduct trades. The method ensures that any modifications made
    to the trade configuration are immediately available to active player bots in
    the game world.

    code: PlayerbotTradeConfig::Reload();

  notes: This method should only be called during runtime when configuration changes
    are detected or manually triggered by an administrator. It is not thread-safe
    and should be executed in a context where no other threads are modifying the trade
    configuration simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method while player bots are actively trading may cause inconsistent
    behavior or temporary disruption in trading operations. Ensure all active trades
    are completed before invoking this method.
