documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether the condition is met based on the provided source information.
  description: The Meets method determines if a given Condition object's criteria
    are satisfied by evaluating the condition against the provided ConditionSourceInfo.
    This method is typically used in game logic to check requirements for quests,
    spells, item usage, or other conditional events. It returns true if all condition
    checks pass, and false otherwise. The evaluation considers various factors such
    as player state, quest status, item ownership, and other contextual data provided
    through the sourceInfo parameter.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the condition is met (true) or not (false).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Condition Check
    code: "Condition* cond = new Condition(CONDITION_SOURCE_TYPE_QUEST, 12345);\n\
      ConditionSourceInfo sourceInfo;\n// ... populate sourceInfo with relevant data\
      \ ...\nbool result = cond->Meets(sourceInfo);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's quest and spell systems to
    validate prerequisites before allowing actions to proceed. The ConditionSourceInfo
    parameter contains all necessary context for the evaluation, including player
    data, object states, and other relevant game information.
