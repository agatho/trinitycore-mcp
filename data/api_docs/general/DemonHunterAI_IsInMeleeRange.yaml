  method: IsInMeleeRange
  signature: bool DemonHunterAI::IsInMeleeRange(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Demon Hunter is within melee attack range of the specified
    target.
  description: The IsInMeleeRange method evaluates if the Demon Hunter AI agent is
    positioned closely enough to engage in melee combat with a given target. This
    method typically checks the distance between the AI's current position and the
    target's position, comparing it against the Demon Hunter's melee range threshold.
    It is commonly used in AI decision-making logic to determine whether to initiate
    melee attacks or to move closer to the target. The method assumes that the target
    is valid and accessible within the AI's context, and may rely on internal state
    tracking of the target's location.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      in the AI's target list. This value is used to retrieve the target's position
      for distance calculation.
  returns: Returns true if the Demon Hunter is within melee range of the specified
    target, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat decision logic
    code: "if (DemonHunterAI* ai = dynamic_cast<DemonHunterAI*>(unit->GetAI())) {\n\
      \    if (ai->IsInMeleeRange(&targetId)) {\n        // Initiate melee attack\n\
      \        unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_MELEE_ATTACK, true);\n    } else {\n\
      \        // Move closer or cast ranged spell\n        ai->DoMoveTo(target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal distance calculations based on the AI's
    current position and the target's position. It may be affected by terrain, obstacles,
    or other environmental factors depending on how the AI system handles movement
    and positioning.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. The method assumes that the target exists and has a
    valid position in the game world.
