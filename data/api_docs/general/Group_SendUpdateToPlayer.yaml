documentation:
  brief: Sends a group update packet to a specific player.
  description: The SendUpdateToPlayer method is responsible for transmitting the current
    state of the group to a designated player. This includes information about group
    members, their roles, and other relevant group data. The method is typically invoked
    when a player joins a group or when group membership changes, ensuring that all
    players have up-to-date information about the group's composition and status.
    It operates within the TrinityCore framework and is part of the core group management
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGUID
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to whom the group update
      packet will be sent.
  - name: slot
    description: A pointer to the MemberSlot structure that contains information about
      a specific group member. This parameter determines which member's data is included
      in the update packet.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Group Update to a Specific Player
    code: 'Group* group = ...; // Assume group is initialized

      MemberSlot* slot = group->GetMemberSlot(0);

      uint32 playerGUID = 12345;

      group->SendUpdateToPlayer(playerGUID, slot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the group system when changes
    occur in group membership or roles. It's important to ensure that the provided
    playerGUID and MemberSlot are valid to avoid sending malformed packets.
