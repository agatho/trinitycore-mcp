documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific dungeon encounter has been completed within the instance.
  description: The IsEncounterCompleted method determines whether a particular dungeon
    encounter, identified by its unique encounter ID, has been successfully concluded
    in the current instance. This method is typically used to track progress through
    raid or dungeon content, allowing scripts to conditionally execute logic based
    on encounter completion status. It relies on internal tracking mechanisms within
    the InstanceScript framework and returns true if the specified encounter has been
    marked as completed, false otherwise. The method does not modify any state but
    provides read-only access to encounter completion data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified dungeon encounter (identified by dungeonEncounterId)
    has been completed in the current instance; returns false if the encounter has
    not been completed or if the encounter ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific boss encounter is completed
    code: "if (instance->IsEncounterCompleted(ENCOUNTER_MARWYN))\n{\n    // Reward\
      \ players for completing Marwyn encounter\n    DoCompleteAchievement(ACHIEVEMENT_COMPLETED_MARWYN);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional logic based on encounter completion
    code: "if (!instance->IsEncounterCompleted(ENCOUNTER_SINDRAGOSA))\n{\n    // Prevent\
      \ players from entering certain areas until Sindragosa is defeated\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Sindragosa must be defeated before proceeding.\");\n    return false;\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Allow access to post-encounter content\n    player->TeleportTo(1234,\
      \ 500.0f, 600.0f, 700.0f, 0.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal encounter tracking system of TrinityCore's
    InstanceScript framework. Encounter IDs must match those defined in the database
    or script definitions for accurate results. The method should only be called from
    within a valid instance context where encounter data is available.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid dungeonEncounterId may return false,
    but it could also indicate a mismatch between the ID used in code and the actual
    encounter definition in the database or script. Ensure all encounter IDs are properly
    defined and consistent across your instance scripts.
