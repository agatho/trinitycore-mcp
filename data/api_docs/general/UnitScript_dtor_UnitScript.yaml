  brief: Destroys a UnitScript instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The UnitScript destructor is responsible for cleaning up resources
    associated with a UnitScript instance when it is no longer needed. This includes
    releasing any allocated memory, unregistering callbacks, and ensuring proper shutdown
    of the script's functionality. As a virtual destructor, it ensures that derived
    classes are properly destroyed when deleting through a base class pointer. The
    destructor typically does not perform any complex operations but ensures that
    all internal state is correctly torn down to prevent memory leaks or undefined
    behavior.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'UnitScript* script = new UnitScript();

      // ... perform operations with the script ...

      delete script; // Triggers ~UnitScript()'
    language: cpp
  notes: Since this is a virtual destructor, it's important to ensure that all derived
    classes also properly implement their own destructors if they manage resources.
    The destructor should not be called directly unless the object is being destroyed.
