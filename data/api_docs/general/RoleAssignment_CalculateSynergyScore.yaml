  class: RoleAssignment
  method: CalculateSynergyScore
  signature: float RoleAssignment::CalculateSynergyScore(Player * player, GroupRole
    role, Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a synergy score for a player's role assignment within
    a group.
  description: The CalculateSynergyScore method evaluates how well a player's assigned
    role aligns with their performance and the overall group composition. This score
    is typically used in group management systems to optimize role distribution, ensure
    balanced team dynamics, and improve raid or dungeon success rates. The method
    considers factors such as player class, specialization, gear level, and group
    role requirements. It requires valid player and group objects to function correctly,
    and returns a floating-point value representing the calculated synergy score.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the synergy score is being
      calculated. Must be a valid player in the group.
  - name: role
    description: The GroupRole enum value indicating the role assigned to the player
      within the group. Valid roles include TANK, HEALER, and DAMAGE.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the player and other group
      members. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated synergy score for the given player's
    role assignment within the specified group. Higher scores indicate better role
    fit and potential for improved group performance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Synergy Score Calculation
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Valid player object

      GroupRole role = TANK;

      Group* group = ...; // Valid group object

      float score = RoleAssignment::CalculateSynergyScore(player, role, group);

      // score now contains the synergy value for this player''s tank role in the
      group'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Synergy Score for Role Optimization
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nGroup* group = ...;\nfloat currentScore = RoleAssignment::CalculateSynergyScore(player,\
      \ TANK, group);\nfloat newScore = RoleAssignment::CalculateSynergyScore(player,\
      \ HEALER, group);\nif (newScore > currentScore) {\n    // Consider reassigning\
      \ player to healer role\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal calculations based on player statistics
    and group composition. It may be computationally intensive if used frequently,
    so caching results is recommended for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the player and group pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid crashes or undefined behavior. The method assumes that the player
    is a member of the provided group.
