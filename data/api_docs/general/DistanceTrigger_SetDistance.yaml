  signature: void DistanceTrigger::SetDistance(float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the distance threshold for the DistanceTrigger.
  description: The SetDistance method configures the distance value that determines
    when the DistanceTrigger will activate. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with trigger zones or events that respond to player proximity. The distance parameter
    defines how close a player must be to the trigger object before the associated
    event is fired. The implementation likely stores this value internally and compares
    it against the actual distance between the triggering unit and the trigger's position
    during update cycles.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Distance Trigger to 10 Yards
    code: 'DistanceTrigger* trigger = new DistanceTrigger();

      trigger->SetDistance(10.0f); // Trigger activates at 10 yards distance'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Distance Adjustment for Quest Triggers
    code: "void UpdateQuestTrigger(DistanceTrigger* questTrigger, float newDistance)\n\
      {\n    questTrigger->SetDistance(newDistance);\n    // Re-evaluate trigger conditions\
      \ if needed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates an internal distance field that is compared against
    player position during periodic checks. It's recommended to call this method before
    activating the trigger to ensure proper initialization.
  warnings: Setting a very small distance value may cause performance issues due to
    frequent proximity checks. Ensure that distance values are within reasonable bounds
    for game mechanics.
