  class: GarrisonMgr
  method: GenerateFollowerDbId
  signature: uint64 GarrisonMgr::GenerateFollowerDbId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique database identifier for a garrison follower.
  description: The GenerateFollowerDbId method creates and returns a unique 64-bit
    identifier that is used to uniquely identify garrison followers within the TrinityCore
    database system. This identifier is typically used when creating new follower
    entries in the database to ensure no two followers share the same ID. The generated
    ID is usually sequential or based on a global counter to maintain uniqueness across
    all garrison followers in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the unique database identifier for a garrison
    follower. This ID should be used when inserting new follower records into the
    database to ensure proper identification and tracking of the follower throughout
    the game.
  examples:
  - title: Generating a Follower Database ID
    code: 'uint64 followerId = sGarrisonMgr->GenerateFollowerDbId();

      // Use followerId when creating a new garrison follower entry in the database'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal counter or database sequence to ensure
    uniqueness. It's important to note that this ID is specific to the database layer
    and may not correspond directly to in-game GUIDs used by the client. The generated
    IDs are typically reserved for use with the garrison system's database tables.
