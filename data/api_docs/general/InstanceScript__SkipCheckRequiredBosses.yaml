documentation:
  brief: Determines whether required boss checks should be skipped for a player in
    an instance.
  description: The _SkipCheckRequiredBosses method evaluates whether the instance
    script should bypass the standard checks for required boss kills before allowing
    players to enter or progress through certain areas of the instance. This is typically
    used in custom instance scripts where specific conditions override default boss
    kill requirements, such as when a player has completed an alternative quest or
    possesses a special item that grants access. The method takes a const Player pointer
    as input and returns true if the required boss checks should be skipped, false
    otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if required boss checks should be skipped for the given player;
    otherwise returns false.

  - title: Basic Usage in Custom Instance Script
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    bool _SkipCheckRequiredBosses(const\
      \ Player* player) const override\n    {\n        // Skip boss checks if player\
      \ has a specific quest flag\n        return player->HasQuestFlag(QUEST_FLAG_CUSTOM_SKIP_CHECKS);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the InstanceScript class and is intended to be overridden
    in custom instance scripts. It's called during instance entry or progression logic,
    so performance should be considered when implementing complex checks.
  warnings: Ensure that skipping boss checks doesn't break game balance or create
    exploits. This method should only be used when there's a clear gameplay reason
    for bypassing standard requirements.
