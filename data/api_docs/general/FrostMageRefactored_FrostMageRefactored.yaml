  method: FrostMageRefactored
  signature: void FrostMageRefactored::FrostMageRefactored(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Frost Mage AI bot with the specified player context.
  description: The FrostMageRefactored constructor initializes a Frost Mage AI bot
    by setting up the necessary player context and internal state for the bot to function
    within the TrinityCore environment. This method prepares the bot for gameplay
    by configuring its spell selection, targeting behavior, and combat logic specific
    to the frost mage class. The initialization process includes setting up the player
    reference, initializing spell caches, and preparing AI decision-making structures.
    It is typically called during the creation or activation of an AI-controlled frost
    mage character in a World of Warcraft server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to player

      FrostMageRefactored frostMage(bot);

      // Bot is now initialized and ready for AI control'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    parameter must not be null, as it's essential for the bot to function correctly.
    The method assumes that the player object has already been properly initialized
    with valid character data and that the TrinityCore AI system is active.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid Player pointer will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the Player object is fully constructed and registered
    within the server before calling this constructor. This method does not perform
    any validation of the player's class or level, so it's the caller's responsibility
    to ensure compatibility.
