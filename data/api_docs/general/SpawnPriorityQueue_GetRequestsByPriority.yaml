  class: SpawnPriorityQueue
  method: GetRequestsByPriority
  signature: int SpawnPriorityQueue::GetRequestsByPriority(SpawnPriority priority)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of spawn requests associated with a specified
    priority level.
  description: The GetRequestsByPriority method returns the count of spawn requests
    that have been queued with a specific SpawnPriority value. This is useful for
    monitoring and managing the distribution of spawn operations across different
    priority levels, ensuring that higher-priority spawns are processed appropriately.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is typically used for debugging
    or performance analysis purposes. It assumes that the SpawnPriority enum values
    are valid and that the internal queue has been properly initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of spawn requests currently queued with
    the specified priority level. Returns zero if no requests exist for that priority
    or if an invalid priority is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spawn Requests Count for High Priority
    code: "int highPriorityCount = spawnQueue.GetRequestsByPriority(SpawnPriority::High);\n\
      if (highPriorityCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"There are \" << highPriorityCount\
      \ << \" high-priority spawns queued.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear scan of the internal spawn request queue to
    count entries matching the specified priority. In performance-critical scenarios,
    frequent calls may introduce overhead. The method is thread-safe if the underlying
    queue structure supports concurrent access.
  warnings: Ensure that the SpawnPriority enum values passed to this method are valid;
    invalid values may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect counts. This method
    should not be used as a mechanism for modifying spawn queues, only for querying
    their state.
