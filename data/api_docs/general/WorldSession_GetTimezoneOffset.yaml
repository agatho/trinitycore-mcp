  method: GetTimezoneOffset
  signature: int WorldSession::GetTimezoneOffset() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the timezone offset in minutes for the connected client.
  description: The GetTimezoneOffset method retrieves the timezone offset of the player's
    client relative to UTC. This value is used by the server to adjust time-related
    game mechanics, such as event scheduling, login times, and other time-sensitive
    features. The returned value represents the difference in minutes between the
    client's local time and UTC, where positive values indicate time zones ahead of
    UTC and negative values indicate time zones behind UTC. This method is typically
    called during session initialization or when timezone-specific data needs to be
    calculated for gameplay purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the timezone offset in minutes. Positive values
    indicate time zones ahead of UTC (e.g., +60 for UTC+1), while negative values
    indicate time zones behind UTC (e.g., -60 for UTC-1). A value of 0 indicates UTC
    time zone.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int offset = session->GetTimezoneOffset();\nif (offset > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"\
      Client is %d minutes ahead of UTC\\n\", offset);\n}\nelse if (offset < 0)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"Client is %d minutes behind UTC\\n\", -offset);\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    printf(\"Client is at UTC time\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Timezone Adjustment for Events
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      int timezoneOffset = session->GetTimezoneOffset();

      uint32 currentTime = time(nullptr);

      uint32 adjustedTime = currentTime + (timezoneOffset * 60); // Convert minutes
      to seconds

      // Use adjustedTime for timezone-aware event calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the client's system timezone settings and may not reflect
    daylight saving time adjustments if not properly configured. The value is set
    during session establishment and typically does not change during the session
    lifetime unless the client updates their system timezone.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this offset for critical game mechanics that require
    precise time synchronization, as it depends on client-side settings which may
    be manipulated or misconfigured. Ensure proper validation of returned values in
    security-sensitive contexts.
