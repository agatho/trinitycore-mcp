  class: GuildIntegration
  method: CoordinateRaidScheduling
  signature: void GuildIntegration::CoordinateRaidScheduling(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates raid scheduling for guild members by managing player participation
    and event coordination.
  description: The CoordinateRaidScheduling method handles the organizational aspects
    of raid scheduling within a guild context. It manages player availability, event
    timing, and communication between guild members to ensure effective raid coordination.
    This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's guild management systems and
    player tracking mechanisms to synchronize raid events. The method operates on
    a pointer to an integer representing a player identifier, suggesting it may be
    part of a larger system that tracks or assigns players to specific raid roles
    or time slots.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) for
      whom raid scheduling coordination is being performed. The value pointed to may
      be modified during execution to reflect updated scheduling information or player
      status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic raid scheduling coordination
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.CoordinateRaidScheduling(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Scheduling coordination with player status update
    code: 'int playerId = 67890;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.CoordinateRaidScheduling(&playerId);

      // playerId may now contain updated scheduling information or status code

      printf("Player ID after scheduling: %d\n", playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method appears to be part of a larger guild management system and likely
    interacts with TrinityCore's event scheduling, player status tracking, and communication
    systems. The parameter being passed as a pointer suggests that the method may
    modify the player identifier or related scheduling data during execution.
  warnings: The method modifies the value pointed to by the 'player' parameter, which
    could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly managed. Developers should ensure
    proper initialization and handling of the integer value before calling this method.
