    mechanics when a milestone is activated or deactivated.

  notes: The method likely interacts with Azerite item progression systems and may
    require careful handling of player state during activation or deactivation. Performance
    considerations include potential for multiple calls during Azerite item updates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect Azerite item milestone
    application, potentially causing game balance issues or player state inconsistencies.
