documentation:
  brief: Enables flying movement mode for the spline initializer
  description: The SetFly method configures the MoveSplineInit object to use flying
    movement behavior. This method is typically called when initializing a spline
    path that should involve flight, such as when a player or creature is flying through
    the air. It modifies the internal state of the spline initializer to indicate
    that the movement should be treated as flying rather than walking or running.
    The method does not perform any actual movement but prepares the spline configuration
    for flight-based motion.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for enabling fly mode
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init;

      init.SetFly();

      // Subsequent calls to initialize spline with flying movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before setting up the actual spline path points.
    The movement type is stored internally and affects how the spline interpolation
    is calculated for flight paths.
