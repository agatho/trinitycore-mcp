  class: FlightPathMovementGenerator
  method: GetResetPosition
  signature: bool FlightPathMovementGenerator::GetResetPosition(int * owner, float
    & x, float & y, float & z)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reset position for a flight path movement generator, returning
    true if successful.
  description: The GetResetPosition method is used to retrieve the coordinates and
    owner identifier associated with a flight path movement generator. This method
    is typically invoked during movement updates or when resetting a character's position
    after completing a flight path. It populates the provided float parameters with
    the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the reset position, and the integer parameter with
    the owner identifier (likely the GUID of the player or creature). The method returns
    true if the reset position data was successfully retrieved and populated, and
    false otherwise. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper character
    positioning during flight path execution in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server
    implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be filled with the owner identifier
      (likely a GUID) of the movement generator's target
  - name: x
    description: Reference to a float that will be filled with the X coordinate of
      the reset position
  - name: y
    description: Reference to a float that will be filled with the Y coordinate of
      the reset position
  - name: z
    description: Reference to a float that will be filled with the Z coordinate of
      the reset position
  returns: Returns true if the reset position data was successfully retrieved and
    populated in the provided parameters, false otherwise. This typically indicates
    whether the movement generator has valid reset coordinates available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int ownerGuid;\nfloat posX, posY, posZ;\nFlightPathMovementGenerator* flightGen\
      \ = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nif (flightGen->GetResetPosition(&ownerGuid,\
      \ posX, posY, posZ)) {\n    printf(\"Reset position: (%f, %f, %f), Owner: %d\\\
      n\", posX, posY, posZ, ownerGuid);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to retrieve\
      \ reset position\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement generator system in TrinityCore and is
    likely used internally by the AI or movement update systems. The owner parameter
    typically represents the GUID of the unit (player or creature) that this flight
    path belongs to, which is important for maintaining proper ownership and tracking
    during flight path execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the parameters are properly initialized before calling this
    method, as invalid pointers could lead to crashes. The method may return false
    if the movement generator has not been properly initialized with reset position
    data.
