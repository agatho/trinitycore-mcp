documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified unit is classified as a healer class.
  description: The IsHealer method evaluates a given Unit object to determine if it
    belongs to a class that is typically designated as a healer within World of Warcraft's
    gameplay mechanics. This classification is based on predefined criteria such as
    the unit's class type, specialization, or role assignment. The method returns
    true if the target unit meets the conditions for being considered a healer, and
    false otherwise. This functionality is commonly used in AI decision-making processes
    for NPCs to prioritize targets or select appropriate actions based on the healing
    capabilities of potential allies or enemies.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the specified unit is classified as
    a healer. Returns true if the target unit has a healer class, and false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (targetSelector->IsHealer(victim)) {\n    // Prioritize damaging other\
      \ targets\n    ai->SetTarget(nullptr);\n} else {\n    // Continue attacking\
      \ the current target\n    ai->Attack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Unit Selection for Healing
    code: "Unit* bestHealer = nullptr;\nfor (auto& unit : unitsInRange) {\n    if\
      \ (targetSelector->IsHealer(unit) && !unit->IsDead()) {\n        if (!bestHealer\
      \ || unit->GetHealth() < bestHealer->GetHealth()) {\n            bestHealer\
      \ = unit;\n        }\n    }\n}\nif (bestHealer) {\n    // Select the lowest\
      \ health healer for assistance\n    ai->SetTarget(bestHealer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on class identification logic that may vary depending
    on the game version and expansion. The implementation might consider both base
    class and specialization data when determining if a unit qualifies as a healer.
