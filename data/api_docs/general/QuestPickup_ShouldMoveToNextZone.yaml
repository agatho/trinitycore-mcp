  class: QuestPickup
  method: ShouldMoveToNextZone
  signature: bool QuestPickup::ShouldMoveToNextZone(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot should move to the next zone during quest pickup.
  description: The ShouldMoveToNextZone method evaluates if a player bot should transition
    to the next geographical zone while performing quest pickup activities. This decision
    is typically based on factors such as quest requirements, zone boundaries, and
    bot behavior settings. The method is commonly used in automated questing systems
    or AI-driven player bots to ensure proper navigation between zones during quest
    progression. It may consider current zone status, quest objectives, and available
    teleportation or movement options.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot should move to the next zone; otherwise returns
    false. The return value indicates whether zone transition logic should be triggered
    based on quest pickup conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Bot Logic
    code: "if (questPickup->ShouldMoveToNextZone(bot)) {\n    bot->MoveToNextZone();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger quest automation framework and may
    interact with zone transition triggers, quest completion checks, and bot movement
    logic. Developers should ensure that the underlying quest data and zone boundaries
    are properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without verifying quest state or zone availability
    can lead to unexpected behavior or bot stuck states. Ensure that all prerequisites
    for zone transitions are met before invoking related movement functions.
