documentation:
  brief: Sets the instance identifier for the WorldObject, determining its location
    within a specific dungeon or raid instance.
  description: This method assigns an instance identifier to a WorldObject, which
    is used to track the object's position within a specific instance of a dungeon
    or raid. The instance ID is crucial for managing object spawns and interactions
    within different instance scenarios, such as heroic or normal difficulty dungeons.
    It ensures that objects are correctly placed in their respective instance environments
    and helps maintain proper game mechanics during instance-based content.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during object initialization or when setting
    up instance-based content. It should be called before any instance-related operations
    occur, and it's important to ensure that the instance ID matches the intended
    dungeon or raid instance.
