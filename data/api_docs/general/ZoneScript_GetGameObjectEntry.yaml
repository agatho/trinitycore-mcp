  class: ZoneScript
  method: GetGameObjectEntry
  signature: uint32 ZoneScript::GetGameObjectEntry(int param0, uint32 entry)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the entry ID of a game object based on a parameter and an entry
    value.
  description: 'The GetGameObjectEntry method is used within ZoneScript classes to
    fetch the entry identifier of a specific game object. This method takes two parameters:
    a numeric parameter (param0) that likely serves as a lookup key or index, and
    an entry value which may represent a default or base entry ID. The method returns
    the actual entry ID associated with the given parameters, allowing scripts to
    dynamically determine which game object template to use in various zone-based
    events or conditions. This functionality is particularly useful for managing dynamic
    content within zones where object behavior or appearance might change based on
    script logic or player actions.'
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A numeric parameter used as a lookup key or index to determine which
      game object entry to retrieve. The exact meaning depends on the implementing
      zone script and may represent a zone-specific identifier, event state, or configuration
      value.
  - name: entry
    description: The base entry ID that may be used in conjunction with param0 to
      calculate or select the final game object entry. This serves as a fallback or
      default value when no specific mapping is found for the given parameter.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the actual entry ID of the game object. If
    no specific mapping exists for the provided parameters, it typically returns the
    base entry value passed in.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 entry = zoneScript->GetGameObjectEntry(1, 12345);

      // Returns the game object entry ID associated with parameter 1 and default
      entry 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Object Selection
    code: 'uint32 zoneState = player->GetZoneScript()->GetZoneState();

      uint32 gameObjectEntry = zoneScript->GetGameObjectEntry(zoneState, 50001);

      // Selects a game object entry based on current zone state and default entry'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of the ZoneScript framework in TrinityCore,
    used for managing dynamic game object behavior within zones. The implementation
    likely involves internal mapping tables or lookup logic that associates parameter
    values with specific game object entries.
  warnings: Ensure that param0 values are within expected ranges to avoid unexpected
    behavior or invalid lookups. This method may return the default entry value if
    no mapping exists, which could lead to incorrect object spawning if not handled
    properly in the calling code.
