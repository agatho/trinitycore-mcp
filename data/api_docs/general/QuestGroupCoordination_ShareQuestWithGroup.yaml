  class: QuestGroupCoordination
  method: ShareQuestWithGroup
  signature: void QuestGroupCoordination::ShareQuestWithGroup(Group * group, uint32
    questId, Player * questGiver)
documentation:
  brief: Shares a quest with all members of a group.
  description: The ShareQuestWithGroup method distributes a specified quest to all
    players within a given group. This functionality is typically used when a player
    accepts a quest from a quest giver and wants to share it with their group members.
    The method ensures that each group member receives the quest in their quest log,
    provided they meet the prerequisites for accepting the quest. It handles the necessary
    communication between the server and clients to update quest status for all group
    members.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will receive
      the quest. Must be a valid group instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest to be shared with the group members.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is offering the quest. This player
      will be used to determine quest giver information and may be involved in quest
      state management.
  returns: null

    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    QuestGroupCoordination::ShareQuestWithGroup(group,\
      \ 12345, player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest is valid and can be accepted by group
    members. It does not perform any validation on whether players are eligible to
    accept the quest. The actual quest sharing is handled through packet communication
    with clients, so performance depends on network conditions and group size.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'group' or 'questGiver' may lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the questId corresponds to an existing quest
    in the database before calling this method.
