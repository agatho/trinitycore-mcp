  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleLocationObjective(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Processes location-based quest objectives for a player bot.
  description: The HandleLocationObjective method manages the completion logic for
    quest objectives that require the player to reach specific geographic locations.
    This function is typically invoked during quest progress updates when a location-based
    objective needs validation. It checks whether the player has met the required
    location criteria, such as being within a certain distance of a target area or
    visiting a named location. The method integrates with the TrinityCore's quest
    system to update objective completion status and may trigger subsequent quest
    events or rewards based on the fulfillment of these location-based conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is processing
      the quest objective. This player must be actively engaged in the quest with
      the specified objective.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing the details
      of the location-based objective to be processed. Includes target coordinates,
      radius, and other relevant criteria for location validation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized player

      QuestObjectiveData objective;

      objective.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_LOCATION;

      objective.location.x = 1234.5f;

      objective.location.y = 6789.0f;

      objective.location.z = 100.0f;

      objective.radius = 50.0f;

      QuestCompletion::HandleLocationObjective(bot, objective);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player's current position is valid and accessible.
    It may perform distance calculations using the TrinityCore's internal coordinate
    system. The function does not directly modify the quest state but rather validates
    whether the objective criteria are met, which can then be used by higher-level
    quest processing logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player object is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Improper handling of location data in the QuestObjectiveData structure
    may lead to incorrect validation results or runtime errors.
