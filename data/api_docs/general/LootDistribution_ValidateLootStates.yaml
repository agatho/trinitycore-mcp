  class: LootDistribution
  method: ValidateLootStates
  signature: void LootDistribution::ValidateLootStates()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the current state of loot distribution within the game world.
  description: The ValidateLootStates method ensures that all active loot distributions
    are in a consistent and valid state. It checks for proper initialization, verifies
    that loot items are correctly assigned to players, and confirms that no invalid
    or corrupted loot data exists in the system. This method is typically invoked
    during critical game events such as zone transitions, server updates, or when
    resolving loot disputes. The validation process may involve checking against internal
    loot tables, verifying player eligibility, and ensuring that distributed loot
    items are properly removed from available pools once claimed.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Logic
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterZone(Player* player)\n{\n    // Validate loot states\
      \ when a player enters a new zone\n    sLootDistribution->ValidateLootStates();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    critical transitions and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required
    for debugging or custom game mechanics. It may perform expensive operations involving
    database lookups or in-memory state checks.
  warnings: Invoking this method outside of appropriate contexts might cause unexpected
    behavior or performance degradation. It's recommended to only call it during designated
    maintenance windows or system transitions.
