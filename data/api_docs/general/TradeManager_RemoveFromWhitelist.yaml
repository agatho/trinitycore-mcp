documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the trade whitelist by their GUID.
  description: The RemoveFromWhitelist method removes a specified player from the
    trade whitelist within the TradeManager. This function is typically used to revoke
    trading permissions for a particular player, ensuring they cannot engage in trades
    with other players who have this player on their whitelist. The operation modifies
    internal data structures that track allowed traders for each player. It is assumed
    that the GUID corresponds to an existing player in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from the
      trade whitelist. This should correspond to a valid player entity in the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Player from Trade Whitelist
    code: 'TradeManager* tm = sWorld->GetTradeManager();

      tm->RemoveFromWhitelist(12345); // Removes player with GUID 12345 from whitelist'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on internal data structures that maintain per-player
    trade permissions. It may be called during events such as account bans or when
    a player opts out of trading with certain individuals.
