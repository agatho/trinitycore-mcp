documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the InteractionManager class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the InteractionManager
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access global interaction-related functionality
    such as handling player interactions with game objects, NPCs, and world events.
    The returned pointer should be used directly without attempting to delete or manage
    its lifetime, as it's managed internally by the singleton implementation. This
    pattern is essential for maintaining consistent state and behavior across different
    parts of the TrinityCore server that require interaction management.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single instance of InteractionManager. The method never
    returns NULL in normal operation, as the singleton is typically initialized during
    server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing InteractionManager Singleton
    code: "InteractionManager* interactionMgr = InteractionManager::Instance();\n\
      // Use interactionMgr to access interaction-related methods\nif (interactionMgr)\n\
      {\n    // Perform interaction operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Instance in Interaction Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerInteraction(Player* player, GameObject* go)\n{\n    InteractionManager*\
      \ im = InteractionManager::Instance();\n    if (im)\n    {\n        im->HandleGameObjectInteraction(player,\
      \ go);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe in most TrinityCore implementations as it typically
    uses static initialization or thread-safe singleton patterns. The singleton instance
    is created during server initialization and persists for the entire runtime of
    the application.
  warnings: Do not attempt to manually delete or destroy the returned pointer, as
    it's managed by the singleton pattern. Avoid calling this method from constructors
    of global objects, as it may lead to initialization order issues.
