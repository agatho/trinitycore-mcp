documentation:
  brief: Updates the totem check status for the shaman AI, verifying and managing
    active totems.
  description: The UpdateTotemCheck method is responsible for maintaining the state
    of totems within the ShamanAI behavior system. It evaluates whether existing totems
    are still valid or need to be refreshed, repositioned, or removed based on game
    conditions such as duration expiration, target changes, or environmental factors.
    This method ensures that the shaman's totem placement remains optimal and aligned
    with current combat strategies. The function typically runs during each AI update
    cycle and interacts with the totem management system to maintain proper totem
    functionality.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ShamanAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n\
      \    UpdateTotemCheck();\n    // ... other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked directly from external code. It relies on internal state tracking
    of totems and may perform operations that modify the totem list or their properties.
