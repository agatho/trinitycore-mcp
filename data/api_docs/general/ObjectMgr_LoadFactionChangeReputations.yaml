documentation:
  brief: Loads faction change reputation data from the database into memory for use
    in character progression mechanics.
  description: The LoadFactionChangeReputations method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with reputation requirements and rewards associated with faction
    changes. This method is typically invoked during server startup or reload operations
    to ensure that players can properly track their reputation gains when switching
    factions. It reads configuration data from the database tables related to faction
    change systems, including required reputation thresholds and corresponding rewards
    or penalties. The loaded data supports the core gameplay mechanic where players
    must meet certain reputation milestones before being able to switch to a new faction.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadFactionChangeReputations();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's initialization sequence and should
    only be called once during server startup or reload operations. The data loaded
    by this method directly affects player faction change behavior and must be consistent
    with database entries.
