  class: DeathRecoveryStatistics
  method: RecordResurrection
  signature: void DeathRecoveryStatistics::RecordResurrection(ResurrectionMethod method,
    uint64 recoveryTimeMs, bool hadSickness)
documentation:
  brief: Records a resurrection event with associated recovery time and sickness status
    for death recovery statistics.
  description: The RecordResurrection method logs information about a player's resurrection
    event, including the method used, the time taken to recover, and whether the player
    had sickness at the time of resurrection. This data is typically used for tracking
    player behavior, balancing game mechanics, and analyzing death recovery patterns
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method updates internal statistics that
    may be accessed later for reporting or gameplay analysis purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: method
    description: The ResurrectionMethod enum value indicating how the player was resurrected
      (e.g., corpse recovery, spirit healer, etc.). Valid values are defined by the
      ResurrectionMethod enumeration.
  - name: recoveryTimeMs
    description: The time in milliseconds it took for the player to recover after
      resurrection. This represents the duration of the resurrection process or cooldown
      period.
  - name: hadSickness
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player had sickness status at
      the time of resurrection. True if the player was affected by sickness, false
      otherwise.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resurrection Recording
    code: 'DeathRecoveryStatistics stats;

      stats.RecordResurrection(ResurrectionMethod::SpiritHealer, 3000, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Corpse-Based Resurrection
    code: 'DeathRecoveryStatistics stats;

      stats.RecordResurrection(ResurrectionMethod::CorpseRecovery, 5000, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the resurrection process when a player's
    death is processed. It assumes that all parameters are valid and properly initialized
    before being passed to the function. The statistics collected here may be used
    for various game analytics or future balancing decisions.
