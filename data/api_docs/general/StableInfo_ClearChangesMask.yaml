documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the stable info object, resetting its modified
    state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a StableInfo object. This operation is typically used to indicate that all
    previously marked modifications to the stable's data have been processed or committed.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method helps manage synchronization
    between client and server state for stable pet data, ensuring that only relevant
    changes are sent to the player's client. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations, making it a simple state reset utility.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called after sending updates to the client or when
    committing changes to persistent storage. It's part of the internal state management
    system for stable pets and should be invoked carefully to maintain data consistency.
