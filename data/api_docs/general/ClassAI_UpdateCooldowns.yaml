  class: ClassAI

  signature: void ClassAI::UpdateCooldowns(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for all abilities and spells in the ClassAI.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking system within the ClassAI class. This method is
    typically called during each AI update cycle to decrement active cooldowns and
    manage spell availability. It ensures that abilities are properly delayed between
    uses according to their defined cooldown periods, which is essential for balancing
    gameplay mechanics in World of Warcraft-style environments. The method processes
    all active cooldowns and marks them as ready when their time has elapsed.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference (in milliseconds) since the last update call.
      This value is used to accurately decrement cooldown timers based on real-time
      progression.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ExampleCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic\
      \ here\n    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    // Continue with other AI behaviors\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Cooldown System
    code: "void CustomClassAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_cooldownTimer >\
      \ 0)\n        m_cooldownTimer -= diff;\n    \n    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n \
      \   \n    if (m_cooldownTimer <= 0 && CanCastSpell())\n    {\n        CastSpell();\n\
      \        m_cooldownTimer = GetSpellCooldown();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI update loop to maintain
    accurate cooldown states. The diff parameter must represent actual elapsed time
    in milliseconds for proper cooldown calculation. Performance is generally low
    impact, but excessive calls without meaningful time differences may cause unnecessary
    processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the diff parameter accurately reflects real-time passage;
    incorrect timing values will lead to inaccurate cooldown behavior. Do not call
    this method outside of AI update contexts unless you're certain about the timing
    implications.
