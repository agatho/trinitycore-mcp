documentation:
  brief: Despawns all personal summons associated with a specific quest for the player.
  description: This method removes all summoned creatures that were created as part
    of a quest objective for the player. It is typically called when a quest is completed,
    abandoned, or reset to ensure that any temporary summoned creatures are properly
    removed from the world. The method iterates through the player's active summons
    and removes those linked to the specified quest ID. This helps maintain clean
    gameplay state and prevents orphaned creatures from persisting in the game world.

  notes: This method only affects summons that were created specifically for quest
    purposes. It does not affect other types of summoned creatures such as pets or
    companions. The method is typically invoked internally by the quest system when
    quest states change.
