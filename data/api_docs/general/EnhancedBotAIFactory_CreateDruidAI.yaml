  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateDruidAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a Druid AI for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreateDruidAI method is responsible for generating a specialized
    Artificial Intelligence behavior tailored for a Druid class bot within the TrinityCore
    framework. This function assigns appropriate AI strategies, abilities, and decision-making
    logic that align with the Druid's unique gameplay mechanics such as form switching,
    spell casting, and combat behaviors. The method typically integrates with the
    broader EnhancedBotAI system to ensure seamless operation of the bot within World
    of Warcraft's game environment. It requires a valid Player object representing
    the bot and returns an integer status code indicating success or failure of the
    AI creation process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value where 0 typically indicates successful AI creation,
    while non-zero values may represent various error conditions such as invalid input
    parameters, memory allocation failures, or AI subsystem unavailability. The exact
    meaning of each return code should be verified against the implementation source.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Druid AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot player object\nint result = factory->CreateDruidAI(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Successfully created Druid AI\n    printf(\"Druid\
      \ AI created successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to create Druid AI with code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger bot AI framework and assumes that the provided
    Player object has been properly initialized with valid Druid class data. The implementation
    may involve dynamic memory allocation for AI components and could be dependent
    on specific TrinityCore build configurations or patches.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player object passed to this method is a valid, initialized
    bot instance with appropriate class data set to Druid. Passing an invalid or uninitialized
    player object may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The return value must
    always be checked for error conditions before proceeding with further AI operations.
