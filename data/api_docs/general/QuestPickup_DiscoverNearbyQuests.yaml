  class: QuestPickup
  method: DiscoverNearbyQuests
  signature: int QuestPickup::DiscoverNearbyQuests(Player * bot, float scanRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Scans for and discovers nearby quests available to the specified player within
    a given radius.
  description: The DiscoverNearbyQuests method searches for all quests that are available
    to the provided player character within the defined scan radius. It evaluates
    quest conditions, requirements, and availability based on the player's current
    location and progress. This method is typically used by AI systems or quest automation
    tools to dynamically identify which quests can be picked up in the immediate vicinity
    of a bot or player. The method returns the count of discovered quests, allowing
    callers to determine how many valid quests were found.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character for whom
      quests are being scanned. Must not be null.
  - name: scanRadius
    description: Float value indicating the maximum distance (in yards) from the player's
      current position to search for quests. Must be a positive number.
  returns: Integer representing the number of quests discovered within the specified
    radius. Returns zero if no quests are found or if an error occurs during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Discovery
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nint questCount = QuestPickup::DiscoverNearbyQuests(player,\
      \ 50.0f);\nif (questCount > 0) {\n    printf(\"Found %d quests nearby\\n\",\
      \ questCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with AI Bot Logic
    code: "void ProcessNearbyQuests(Player* bot) {\n    float radius = 100.0f;\n \
      \   int discovered = QuestPickup::DiscoverNearbyQuests(bot, radius);\n    if\
      \ (discovered > 0) {\n        // Proceed with quest pickup logic\n        printf(\"\
      AI Bot found %d quests to pursue\\n\", discovered);\n    } else {\n        //\
      \ No quests available, perhaps move or wait\n        printf(\"No quests found\
      \ within %.1f yards\\n\", radius);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore quest system's internal logic for determining
    quest availability. It may perform database queries and condition checks, so frequent
    calls could impact performance. The scan radius is interpreted as a spherical
    area around the player's position.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. Also, be cautious when using large
    scan radii in high-traffic areas as it may cause performance degradation due to
    numerous quest checks.
