  class: BotProfiler
  method: GetProfilingOverhead
  signature: double BotProfiler::GetProfilingOverhead() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the overhead percentage introduced by profiling mechanisms
    within the bot system.
  description: The GetProfilingOverhead method computes the additional computational
    cost incurred by profiling activities in the bot system. This value represents
    the proportion of time or resources spent on profiling versus actual bot behavior
    execution. The method is typically used to assess the performance impact of profiling
    features and to optimize bot behavior accordingly. It provides a normalized value
    that can be used for comparative analysis between different bot configurations
    or profiling settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double precision floating-point value representing the profiling overhead
    as a percentage. A value of 0.0 indicates no overhead, while higher values indicate
    greater computational cost due to profiling activities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'double overhead = botProfiler->GetProfilingOverhead();

      printf("Profiling overhead: %.2f%%\n", overhead * 100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis
    code: "BotProfiler* profiler = sObjectAccessor->GetBotProfiler();\nif (profiler)\n\
      {\n    double overhead = profiler->GetProfilingOverhead();\n    if (overhead\
      \ > 0.1) // Over 10% overhead\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Warning: High\
      \ profiling overhead detected (%.2f%%)\", overhead * 100);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves measuring time spent in profiling code versus
    actual bot logic execution. The implementation may use high-resolution timers
    or performance counters to calculate the overhead accurately. It's important to
    note that this value is typically computed over a period of time and may be averaged
    or smoothed for consistency.
  warnings: The returned value should not be used as an absolute measure of performance
    but rather as a relative indicator. Profiling overhead can vary significantly
    based on system load, bot complexity, and profiling granularity settings. Results
    may fluctuate between different execution contexts.
