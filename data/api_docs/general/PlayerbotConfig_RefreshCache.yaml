  class: PlayerbotConfig
  method: RefreshCache
  signature: void PlayerbotConfig::RefreshCache()
documentation:
  brief: Refreshes the player bot configuration cache to ensure all settings are up-to-date
    with current in-game state.
  description: The RefreshCache method updates the internal configuration cache of
    a PlayerbotConfig instance, ensuring that any changes made to bot behavior settings,
    AI parameters, or gameplay-related configurations are properly loaded and applied.
    This method is typically invoked when configuration changes occur during runtime,
    such as after loading new settings from database or config files, or when switching
    between different bot profiles. It ensures consistency between the in-memory cache
    and the actual configuration data used by player bots.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerbotConfig config;

      config.RefreshCache();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Configuration Change
    code: "void UpdateBotSettings()\n{\n    // Modify some bot settings\n    sPlayerbotAIConfig->SetPlayerbotAIConfig(\"\
      some_setting\", \"new_value\");\n    \n    // Refresh cache to apply changes\n\
      \    sPlayerbotAIConfig->RefreshCache();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever configuration values are modified externally
    to ensure that the cached values reflect the current state. It may involve database
    queries or file I/O operations depending on how configurations are stored and
    loaded.
