  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::SendAchievementMembers(Player * receiver, uint32
    achievementId) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends achievement member data to a specified player for a given achievement
    ID.
  description: The SendAchievementMembers method is responsible for transmitting information
    about which guild members have earned a specific achievement to a designated player.
    This functionality is part of the Guild Achievement Manager system in TrinityCore,
    enabling players to view progress and recognition of their guildmates' accomplishments.
    The method likely constructs and sends a packet containing member data related
    to the achievement, ensuring that only relevant players receive this information.
    It operates within the context of guild achievements and requires proper authorization
    or access control for execution.
  parameters:
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object who will receive the achievement member
      data. This player must be online and in the same guild as the achievement members
      being sent.
  - name: achievementId
    description: The unique identifier of the achievement for which member data is
      being retrieved and sent. This ID corresponds to a specific achievement defined
      in the game's achievement system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send Achievement Members Data to Player
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume valid player object

      uint32 achievementID = 12345;

      GuildAchievementMgr::SendAchievementMembers(targetPlayer, achievementID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the guild achievement system when
    a player requests to see who has earned a particular achievement. It may involve
    checking permissions or access levels for the receiver to ensure they are allowed
    to view the data. Performance considerations should be taken into account if many
    players are requesting achievement data simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the receiver player is valid and online before calling this
    method, as sending data to an invalid player could cause errors. Also, verify
    that the achievement ID exists in the game's achievement database to avoid undefined
    behavior.
