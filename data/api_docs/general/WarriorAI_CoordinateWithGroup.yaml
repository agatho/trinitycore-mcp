documentation:
  brief: Coordinates the warrior's actions with nearby group members to optimize combat
    effectiveness.
  description: The CoordinateWithGroup method is responsible for synchronizing a warrior's
    AI behavior with other players in the same group during combat situations. This
    method evaluates the current group composition, identifies available allies, and
    adjusts the warrior's tactical decisions accordingly. It ensures that the warrior
    does not perform actions that would conflict with or hinder nearby group members,
    such as casting spells that might interrupt another player's cast or positioning
    in a way that blocks teammates. The method also considers the overall group strategy,
    such as focusing fire on specific targets or maintaining optimal positioning for
    tanking duties.

  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    CoordinateWithGroup();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually unless implementing custom group coordination logic. The implementation
    relies on the AI's access to group information through the base CreatureAI class
    and may depend on the current combat state and target selection.
  warnings: Improper use of this method outside of the intended AI update context
    could lead to unexpected behavior or performance issues. The method assumes that
    the warrior is part of a valid group with accessible members; calling it when
    not in a group may result in undefined behavior.
