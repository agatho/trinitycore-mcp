documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the map difficulty conditions array for the specified map difficulty
    ID.
  description: The GetMapDifficultyConditions method fetches a constant integer array
    that defines the conditions associated with a specific map difficulty ID. This
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to determine which game rules,
    restrictions, or modifiers apply to a given map difficulty setting. The returned
    pointer points to an internal data structure managed by the DB2Manager class and
    should not be modified or freed by the caller. The method assumes that the provided
    mapDifficultyId corresponds to a valid entry in the game's database files.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing the conditions
    for the specified map difficulty ID. Returns nullptr if the mapDifficultyId is
    invalid or no conditions are defined for it.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through map difficulty conditions
    code: "const int* conditions = sDB2Manager->GetMapDifficultyConditions(5);\nif\
      \ (conditions != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10 && conditions[i] !=\
      \ 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Condition %d: %d\\n\", i, conditions[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal DB2 data structures and relies on the correct
    loading of map difficulty condition files. The returned array is not guaranteed
    to be null-terminated, so callers should know the expected length or use a sentinel
    value (like 0) to determine end-of-array.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned array as it points to internal read-only memory.
    Ensure that the mapDifficultyId parameter corresponds to an existing difficulty
    entry in the database; otherwise, the result may be undefined or null.
