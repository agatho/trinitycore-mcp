  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleSetEveryoneIsAssistant
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleSetEveryoneIsAssistant(WorldPackets::Party::SetEveryoneIsAssistant
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Sets all members in the player's party to assistant status.
  description: The HandleSetEveryoneIsAssistant method processes a packet from the
    client that requests setting all members of the current player's party to assistant
    role. This functionality is typically used in group management to quickly assign
    assistant privileges to all party members, which can be useful for loot distribution
    or other group-related operations. The method validates the player's party membership
    and ensures proper permissions before executing the change. It updates the party
    member roles on the server side and broadcasts the changes to all affected party
    members.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in party context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSetEveryoneIsAssistant(WorldPackets::Party::SetEveryoneIsAssistant&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (!GetPlayer() || !GetPlayer()->GetGroup())\n        return;\n\
      \n    Group* group = GetPlayer()->GetGroup();\n    if (group->IsLeader(GetPlayer()))\n\
      \    {\n        group->SetEveryoneIsAssistant(true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player has sufficient permissions to modify party
    settings. The implementation relies on the Group class's SetEveryoneIsAssistant
    functionality which handles the actual role assignment and synchronization with
    other players in the group.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid party
    context. Calling it outside of a party will result in no action being taken. Additionally,
    this operation affects all party members, so it should be used carefully to avoid
    unintended consequences for group dynamics.
