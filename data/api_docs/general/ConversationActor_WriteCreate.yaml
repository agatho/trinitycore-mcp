  class: ConversationActor
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ConversationActor::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Conversation
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes conversation actor data into a byte buffer for network transmission
    to a specific player.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state of a ConversationActor
    instance into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for network transmission to a specific
    player. This method is typically used when initializing or spawning a conversation
    actor in the game world for a particular client. It encodes relevant actor properties
    such as GUID, position, orientation, and other metadata necessary for the client
    to properly display and interact with the conversation element. The method takes
    into account the owner conversation and target receiver player to ensure proper
    serialization context.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized actor data will be
      written.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Conversation object that owns this actor, used for
      context during serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this serialized data,
      used to determine client-specific serialization details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in conversation initialization
    code: 'ConversationActor actor;

      ByteBuffer buffer;

      Player* player = ...; // Get target player

      Conversation* conv = ...; // Get owning conversation

      actor.WriteCreate(buffer, conv, player);

      // Send buffer to player via network

      player->SendDirectMessage(&buffer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's network serialization system for
    dynamic game objects. It should be called during conversation initialization or
    when sending updates about actor state changes. The method may perform different
    serialization based on player session data, such as client version compatibility.
