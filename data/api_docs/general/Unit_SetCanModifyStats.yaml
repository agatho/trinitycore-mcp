  class: Unit
  method: SetCanModifyStats
  signature: void Unit::SetCanModifyStats(bool modifyStats)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the unit can modify its stats.
  description: This method controls whether a Unit can modify its stat values, such
    as strength, agility, intellect, and other attributes. When set to true, the unit
    is allowed to modify its stats; when set to false, the unit is restricted from
    modifying its stats. This functionality is crucial for managing player character
    progression and preventing unauthorized stat modifications during gameplay. The
    method typically affects game mechanics related to character advancement and stat
    allocation.
  parameters:
  - name: modifyStats
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the unit should be allowed to
      modify its stats. True enables stat modification, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit();

      player->SetCanModifyStats(true);

      // Player can now modify stats'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit();

      player->SetCanModifyStats(false);

      // Player cannot modify stats

      // This is often used during questing or when a player is in a restricted state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the internal stat modification flags of the unit. It
    should be used carefully as it may impact game balance and character progression.
    The implementation typically involves setting internal flags that control whether
    stats can be modified.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to game balance issues or unexpected
    behavior in player character progression. Care should be taken when setting this
    flag during gameplay, especially in scenarios where stat modification is restricted.
