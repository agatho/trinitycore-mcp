documentation:
  brief: Compares two Cell objects for equality based on their coordinates.
  description: The operator== method checks whether two Cell objects represent the
    same cell in the game world by comparing their X and Y coordinates. This comparison
    is essential for determining if two different Cell instances refer to the same
    location within the grid-based world system used by TrinityCore. The method performs
    a direct coordinate comparison without considering other cell properties such
    as height or terrain data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if both Cell objects have identical X and Y coordinates, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic cell equality check
    code: 'Cell cell1(50, 60);

      Cell cell2(50, 60);

      bool isEqual = (cell1 == cell2); // Returns true'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing cells with different coordinates
    code: 'Cell cellA(10, 20);

      Cell cellB(15, 25);

      bool isEqual = (cellA == cellB); // Returns false'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only compares the coordinate values of cells and does not account
    for any additional metadata or properties that might be associated with a cell
    in the game world. It's commonly used in spatial queries, grid management, and
    zone-based operations within the TrinityCore framework.
