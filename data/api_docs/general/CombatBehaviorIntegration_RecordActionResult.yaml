  method: RecordActionResult
  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::RecordActionResult(const RecommendedAction
    & action, bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records the outcome of a recommended combat action for behavior analysis
    and decision-making.
  description: The RecordActionResult method logs whether a recommended combat action
    was successful or not. This method is typically used within the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    class to track the effectiveness of AI decisions during combat scenarios. It allows
    the system to learn from past actions and adjust future recommendations accordingly.
    The method stores this information for potential use in behavior tuning, performance
    metrics, or debugging purposes. It does not require any specific preconditions
    but assumes that the action parameter contains valid data about a previously recommended
    combat move.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: The RecommendedAction object representing the combat action that
      was executed. This parameter contains details about the action type, target,
      and other relevant metadata.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the recommended action was successful
      (true) or failed (false). This determines the outcome record stored in the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'RecommendedAction action;

      action.type = ACTION_MELEE_ATTACK;

      action.targetGuid = 12345;


      // Record successful attack

      combatBehavior.RecordActionResult(action, true);


      // Record failed attack

      combatBehavior.RecordActionResult(action, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void Unit::ExecuteCombatAction(const RecommendedAction& action)\n{\n  \
      \  bool success = PerformAction(action);\n    combatBehaviorIntegrator->RecordActionResult(action,\
      \ success);\n    \n    if (!success)\n    {\n        // Log failed action for\
      \ behavior analysis\n        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_COMBAT, \"Combat action\
      \ %u failed for unit %u\", action.type, GetGUID().GetCounter());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during combat scenarios.
    It's recommended to batch multiple calls or use asynchronous logging if performance
    becomes an issue. The method should not be called with invalid action data as
    it may lead to inconsistent behavior tracking.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that the RecommendedAction object
    contains valid data, as invalid actions could corrupt internal behavior analysis
    metrics. Also, avoid calling this method in high-frequency loops without proper
    batching or throttling mechanisms.
