  class: BrewmasterMonkRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoEThreatRotation
  signature: void BrewmasterMonkRefactored::ExecuteAoEThreatRotation(int * target,
    uint32 enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Brewmaster Monk's AoE threat rotation logic for managing multiple
    enemy targets.
  description: The ExecuteAoEThreatRotation method implements the core logic for a
    Brewmaster Monk's ability to handle multiple enemies in an AoE combat scenario.
    This method determines which abilities should be used based on current threat
    levels, enemy count, and available resources such as brews and stances. It is
    typically invoked during encounters where the monk faces several opponents simultaneously,
    ensuring optimal resource usage and threat generation for tanking purposes. The
    method modifies internal state variables related to target selection and ability
    casting order.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current primary target index
      or identifier within the combat environment.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the total number of enemies currently
      engaged in combat with this Brewmaster Monk.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int currentTarget = 0;

      uint32 numEnemies = 5;

      player->GetBrewmasterAI()->ExecuteAoEThreatRotation(&currentTarget, numEnemies);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Targeting
    code: "int* targetPtr = &targetIndex;\nuint32 enemyCount = GetEnemyCount();\n\
      if (enemyCount > 1)\n{\n    player->GetBrewmasterAI()->ExecuteAoEThreatRotation(targetPtr,\
      \ enemyCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Brewmaster Monk AI has already been initialized
    and that valid targets exist in the combat environment. It relies on internal
    state tracking for cooldowns, resource levels, and threat management systems.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization or with invalid target
    pointers may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure enemyCount is accurately
    calculated before invocation.
