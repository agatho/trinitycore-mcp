  class: EvokerAI
  method: RecordDamageDealt
  signature: void EvokerAI::RecordDamageDealt(int damage, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Records damage dealt by the evoker to a target for tracking and analytics
    purposes.
  description: The RecordDamageDealt method is used within the EvokerAI class to log
    damage values inflicted on targets. This function likely serves as part of the
    AI's combat analytics system, allowing the evoker to maintain records of its offensive
    actions for performance evaluation, achievement tracking, or internal state management.
    The method accepts a damage value and a pointer to a target, suggesting it may
    update or store information related to that specific combat interaction. It is
    typically invoked during combat when the evoker deals damage to enemies.
  parameters:
  - name: damage
    description: The amount of damage dealt by the evoker in this action. Must be
      a non-negative integer representing the damage points.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target that received the damage. This parameter is
      expected to point to a valid game object or entity, typically an enemy unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: "void EvokerAI::OnSpellHit(Unit* target, SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n\
      \    int damage = spellInfo->Effects[0].DamageMin;\n    RecordDamageDealt(damage,\
      \ &target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking multiple damage sources
    code: "void EvokerAI::DealDamageToTarget(Unit* target, int baseDamage)\n{\n  \
      \  int totalDamage = baseDamage + GetAdditionalDamage();\n    RecordDamageDealt(totalDamage,\
      \ &target);\n    // Additional logic for damage tracking or event reporting\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger combat analytics system and may be
    used in conjunction with other methods such as RecordDamageTaken or UpdateCombatStats.
    It's important to ensure that the target pointer passed is valid, as dereferencing
    an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the damage value is always non-negative and that the target
    pointer is properly initialized before calling this method. Passing a null pointer
    for target may cause crashes or unexpected behavior in the AI system.
