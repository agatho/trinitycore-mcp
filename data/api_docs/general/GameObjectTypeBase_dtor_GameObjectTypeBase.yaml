documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GameObjectTypeBase instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GameObjectTypeBase class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this typically involves releasing references to game object templates, data structures,
    or other internal resources that may have been initialized when the object was
    created. This method is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted, ensuring proper memory management and preventing resource
    leaks within the game server environment.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of GameObjectTypeBase instance
    code: 'GameObjectTypeBase* obj = new GameObjectTypeBase();

      // ... use obj ...

      delete obj; // Destructor is automatically called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is part of the standard C++ object lifecycle and should not
    be manually invoked. It's important to ensure that all derived classes properly
    implement their own destructors if they manage additional resources, as the base
    class destructor will be called automatically after derived destructors complete.
