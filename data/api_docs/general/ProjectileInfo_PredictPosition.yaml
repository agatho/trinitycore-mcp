  class: ProjectileInfo
  method: PredictPosition
  signature: int ProjectileInfo::PredictPosition(uint32 atTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the predicted position of a projectile at a specified
    time.
  description: The PredictPosition method computes the expected location of a projectile
    at a given point in time, based on its current trajectory and movement properties.
    This functionality is essential for handling projectile-based spells and abilities
    in World of Warcraft, particularly for determining hit detection, collision handling,
    and visual effects. The method takes into account the projectile's initial position,
    velocity, acceleration, and other motion parameters to estimate where it will
    be at the specified time. It is commonly used by the server to validate spell
    casts, determine if projectiles will hit targets, or synchronize client-side visuals
    with server-side physics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the result of the position prediction
    calculation. A positive return value typically indicates success and may represent
    a valid coordinate or index, while a negative value could indicate an error condition
    such as invalid input parameters or inability to predict the trajectory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Projectile Position Prediction
    code: "uint32 futureTime = 1000; // 1 second in milliseconds\nint predictedPosition\
      \ = projectileInfo->PredictPosition(futureTime);\nif (predictedPosition >= 0)\n\
      {\n    // Use predicted position for further logic\n    printf(\"Projectile\
      \ will be at position: %d\\n\", predictedPosition);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ prediction failure\n    printf(\"Failed to predict projectile position\\n\"\
      );\n}"

  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's spell system for handling
    projectile-based abilities. Developers should be aware that the accuracy of the
    prediction depends on the completeness and correctness of the projectile's motion
    data. The method may perform calculations using fixed-point arithmetic or other
    numerical methods to ensure consistency across different systems.
  warnings: The method signature indicates it takes a uint32 parameter, which suggests
    it expects time values in milliseconds. Using incorrect time units may lead to
    inaccurate predictions. Additionally, if the projectile's motion parameters are
    not properly initialized, the prediction may fail or return unexpected results.
