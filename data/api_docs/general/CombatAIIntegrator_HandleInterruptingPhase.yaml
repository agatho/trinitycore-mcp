  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: HandleInterruptingPhase
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::HandleInterruptingPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the interrupting phase logic for combat AI integration.
  description: The HandleInterruptingPhase method manages the state and behavior during
    an interrupting phase within the CombatAIIntegrator class. This typically involves
    processing interrupts such as spell casts, abilities, or other actions that may
    be interrupted by external factors like silence, root effects, or enemy interactions.
    The method ensures proper handling of these interruptions to maintain consistent
    AI behavior and game flow. It is designed to be called during combat updates when
    interrupt conditions are evaluated.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat update loop
    code: "void CombatAIIntegrator::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic ...\n    HandleInterruptingPhase();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure proper
    interrupt handling. The implementation likely checks for active interrupts and
    applies appropriate state changes or cooldowns. It may also trigger visual effects
    or sound cues related to the interruption.
