  class: LootDistribution
  method: HandleMasterLootDistribution
  signature: void LootDistribution::HandleMasterLootDistribution(Group * group, const
    LootItem & item, Player * recipient)
documentation:
  brief: Processes master loot distribution for a group member when a loot item is
    awarded.
  description: The HandleMasterLootDistribution method manages the distribution of
    an item awarded through the master loot system in a group context. It assigns
    the specified loot item to the designated recipient player within the provided
    group, ensuring proper tracking and notification of the loot assignment. This
    method is typically invoked when a group member wins the right to receive a loot
    item through the master loot roll mechanism, which is used for items that require
    group consensus or specific loot rules. The method handles updating internal loot
    state and notifying players about their loot gains.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group where the loot
      distribution occurs. Must be a valid group with members.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      item being distributed, such as item ID, stack size, and roll information.
  - name: recipient
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the loot item. Must
      be a valid player member of the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Master Loot Distribution
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      item.itemid = 12345;

      item.count = 1;

      LootDistribution::HandleMasterLootDistribution(group, item, player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and recipient are valid and that the master
    loot rules have already been applied. The method does not perform any validation
    of the item or group state beyond basic pointer checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the group and player parameters are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid pointers may cause crashes. The method does not handle cases
    where the recipient is not a member of the group.
