api:
  class: World
  method: SetAllowMovement
  signature: void World::SetAllowMovement(bool allow)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether player movement is allowed in the world.
  description: The SetAllowMovement method enables or disables player movement within
    the game world. When movement is disabled, players cannot move their characters
    using standard controls, which is commonly used during certain game events, combat
    scenarios, or when players are in specific states such as being stunned or rooted.
    This method directly affects the player's ability to navigate the game environment
    and can be used in conjunction with other game mechanics to control character
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: allow
    description: A boolean value indicating whether movement should be allowed (true)
      or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable Player Movement
    code: World::instance()->SetAllowMovement(false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Enable Player Movement After Event
    code: World::instance()->SetAllowMovement(true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal movement state flags for players and
    may be used in combination with other movement-related APIs. It's important to
    ensure that movement is properly re-enabled after disabling it, especially during
    temporary game states.
