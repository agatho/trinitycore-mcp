  class: BotChatCommandHandler

  signature: CommandResult BotChatCommandHandler::ProcessNaturalLanguageCommand(const
    CommandContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a natural language command from a bot chat context and returns
    the result of the command execution.
  description: The ProcessNaturalLanguageCommand method in the BotChatCommandHandler
    class is responsible for interpreting and executing natural language commands
    received through a bot's chat interface. This method takes a CommandContext object
    that contains all relevant information about the incoming command, such as the
    player who sent it, the message content, and the context in which the command
    was issued. It parses the input, determines the appropriate action to take based
    on the command structure, and executes the corresponding logic within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method returns a CommandResult that indicates whether the command
    was successfully processed or if an error occurred during execution. This functionality
    is essential for enabling bots to understand and respond to complex, human-readable
    commands in-game.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CommandResult enum value indicating the outcome of command processing.
    Possible values include COMMAND_OK for successful execution, COMMAND_FAILED for
    general failures, and other specific error codes depending on the nature of the
    failure encountered during command interpretation or execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ProcessNaturalLanguageCommand
    code: "CommandContext context;\n// Assume context is populated with a valid command\n\
      BotChatCommandHandler handler;\nCommandResult result = handler.ProcessNaturalLanguageCommand(context);\n\
      if (result == COMMAND_OK) {\n    // Command executed successfully\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI system and relies heavily on natural language
    processing capabilities. It should only be called when a valid command context
    is available. The method may perform database operations or interact with game
    objects, so it's important to ensure thread safety if used in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: The method assumes that the CommandContext object passed to it contains
    valid data. Passing an invalid or uninitialized context could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Additionally, since this is a bot command handler, improper
    handling of user input can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not
    properly sanitized.
