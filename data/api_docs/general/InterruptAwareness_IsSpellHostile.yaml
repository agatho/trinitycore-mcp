  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: IsSpellHostile
  signature: bool InterruptAwareness::IsSpellHostile(Unit * caster, const Spell *
    spell) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell cast by a unit is considered hostile within the
    InterruptAwareness system.
  description: The IsSpellHostile method evaluates if a given spell, cast by a specified
    caster unit, is classified as hostile. This determination is crucial for the InterruptAwareness
    system to decide when to interrupt or react to spells based on their hostility.
    The method checks various spell properties and caster-target relationships to
    make this assessment. It's commonly used in AI logic to determine appropriate
    responses to incoming spells, such as whether to cast defensive spells or prepare
    for counter-attacks. This functionality is integral to the game's combat system
    and AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is casting the spell. This represents
      the source of the spell and is essential for determining hostility based on
      faction, relationship, or other unit-specific properties.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object being cast. This contains all relevant
      spell data including spell ID, effects, and properties that are used in the
      hostility determination logic.
  returns: Returns true if the spell is classified as hostile, false otherwise. A
    hostile spell typically indicates an attack or harmful effect directed at the
    player or their allies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (interruptAwareness.IsSpellHostile(caster, spell)) {\n    // Cast defensive\
      \ spell or prepare for counter-attack\n    unit->CastSpell(target, DEFENSIVE_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Hostility Before Interrupting
    code: "if (interruptAwareness.IsSpellHostile(caster, spell) && !spell->IsPassive())\
      \ {\n    // Only interrupt hostile non-passive spells\n    unit->InterruptNonMeleeSpells(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell and unit relationship logic. It may
    consider faction affiliations, threat levels, and spell school properties to determine
    hostility. The implementation might vary depending on the specific subclass or
    context of InterruptAwareness being used.
  warnings: Ensure that both caster and spell parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method to avoid null pointer dereferences. Be aware that the definition
    of 'hostile' may change based on game state, faction changes, or temporary conditions
    like stealth or divine invincibility.
