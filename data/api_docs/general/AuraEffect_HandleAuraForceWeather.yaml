  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraForceWeather(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a forced weather effect aura on the target.
  description: The HandleAuraForceWeather method manages the application and removal
    of forced weather effects on a target unit. This method is invoked during aura
    application or removal events, controlling how weather conditions are enforced
    on players or areas. It interacts with the game's weather system to ensure that
    specified weather types (such as rain, snow, or storms) are displayed regardless
    of normal environmental conditions. The method handles both the visual and gameplay
    effects associated with forced weather, including potential modifications to movement
    speed, visibility, or other environmental modifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. Contains information about the aura's state, target, and
      application context.
  - name: mode
    description: Specifies the operation mode for the aura effect. Typically indicates
      whether the aura is being applied (1) or removed (0).
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the aura should be applied (true) or removed
      (false). This parameter works in conjunction with the mode to determine the
      exact behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Forced Weather Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = aura->GetEffect(0);

      effect->HandleAuraForceWeather(auraApp, 1, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Forced Weather Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = aura->GetEffect(0);

      effect->HandleAuraForceWeather(auraApp, 0, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system and should only be called
    from within the core aura application logic. It directly affects the client-side
    weather rendering and may influence gameplay mechanics such as movement speed
    or visibility in certain environments.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method can lead to incorrect weather states being
    displayed to players, potentially causing confusion or gameplay disruption. Ensure
    that the mode and apply parameters are correctly set based on the aura's actual
    state.
