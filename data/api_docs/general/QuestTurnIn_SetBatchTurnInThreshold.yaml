  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: SetBatchTurnInThreshold
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::SetBatchTurnInThreshold(uint32 botGuid, uint32 threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the batch turn-in threshold for a specific bot GUID.
  description: The SetBatchTurnInThreshold method configures the maximum number of
    quests that can be turned in simultaneously by a bot identified by its unique
    GUID. This setting is used to control how many quest completions are processed
    in a single batch operation, which helps optimize performance and prevent excessive
    resource consumption during automated quest completion. The threshold value determines
    when the bot should submit multiple quest turn-ins together rather than individually.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to set the batch
      turn-in threshold. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity in the game
      world.
  - name: threshold
    description: The maximum number of quests that can be turned in at once for the
      specified bot. Valid values are typically positive integers, with higher values
      allowing more concurrent quest submissions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: QuestTurnIn::SetBatchTurnInThreshold(12345, 5);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting High Threshold for Efficient Batch Processing
    code: QuestTurnIn::SetBatchTurnInThreshold(playerBotGuid, 20);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in automated questing systems or AI bots to
    manage the efficiency of quest completion. Setting a higher threshold may improve
    performance but could also increase memory usage and processing time per batch
    operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter refers to an active and valid bot instance,
    otherwise the setting might not take effect. Incorrectly setting a very high threshold
    may cause performance issues or resource exhaustion during batch processing.
