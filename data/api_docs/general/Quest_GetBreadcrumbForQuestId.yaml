documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the breadcrumb identifier associated with a specific quest ID.
  description: This method returns the breadcrumb identifier for a given quest ID,
    which is used to track quest progress and determine the current state of a player's
    quest log. The breadcrumb identifier typically corresponds to a unique value that
    represents the quest's position in the game's quest system. This method is commonly
    used in conjunction with other quest-related functions to manage quest completion
    status and ensure proper progression within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the breadcrumb identifier for the specified
    quest ID. If no valid breadcrumb exists, it returns -1, indicating that the quest
    has not been properly initialized or is not recognized by the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 breadcrumbId = quest->GetBreadcrumbForQuestId();\nif (breadcrumbId\
      \ != -1)\n{\n    // Quest has a valid breadcrumb\n    // Proceed with further\
      \ processing\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Quest not recognized or invalid\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest tracking systems
    and may require the quest to be initialized before returning meaningful results.
    The method should be called only when the quest object is valid and properly loaded.
  warnings: This method should not be called on uninitialized or invalid quest objects,
    as it may return unexpected values or cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the
    quest ID is valid before calling this method.
