  class: LootCoordination
  method: ExecuteEfficientCoordination
  signature: void LootCoordination::ExecuteEfficientCoordination(Group * group, const
    LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Executes efficient loot coordination for a group and item, managing loot
    distribution according to group rules.
  description: The ExecuteEfficientCoordination method handles the core logic for
    coordinating loot distribution among group members in a World of Warcraft environment.
    It ensures that loot is properly distributed according to the group's loot settings,
    such as round-robin, free-for-all, or master loot. This method typically processes
    a single item within a group context and applies appropriate coordination rules
    to determine how the item should be awarded. The method is designed to minimize
    overhead and maximize performance during loot distribution events.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players participating
      in the loot coordination. Must not be null.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to a LootItem structure containing information about the
      item being coordinated for distribution. The item must have valid loot data
      and be part of the group's loot pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot coordination
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      LootItem item;

      // ... populate item with loot data ...

      LootCoordination::ExecuteEfficientCoordination(group, item);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with loot processing system
    code: "void ProcessLootForGroup(Player* player, LootItem& item)\n{\n    Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && item.lootid > 0)\n    {\n  \
      \      LootCoordination::ExecuteEfficientCoordination(group, item);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during loot processing when a group member
    has looted an item. It assumes that the group and item parameters are valid and
    properly initialized. The method may internally handle various loot rules such
    as need-before-greed, master loot, or free-for-all distribution depending on group
    settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing invalid or uninitialized LootItem structures may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. This method should only be called in contexts where group
    loot coordination is appropriate.
