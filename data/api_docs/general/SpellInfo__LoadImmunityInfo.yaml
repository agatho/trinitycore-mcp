documentation:
  brief: Loads immunity information for spell effects and mechanics
  description: This method initializes and loads immunity data for spells, including
    immunity types, mechanic types, and spell attributes that affect how players and
    creatures interact with various spell effects. It processes the spell's immunity
    information during the loading phase of the spell system, ensuring proper handling
    of immunity mechanics such as immunity to damage, crowd control, and other spell-related
    interactions. The method is typically called during spell initialization and prepares
    data structures for subsequent spell processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'SpellInfo* spellInfo = new SpellInfo();

      spellInfo->_LoadImmunityInfo();

      // This method is typically called during spell loading process'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during spell initialization phase. It may
    affect performance if called repeatedly on already loaded spells. Thread safety
    depends on the implementation of the underlying data structures.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect immunity handling and
    potentially cause game mechanics issues. Ensure that this method is not called
    after spell initialization has completed.
