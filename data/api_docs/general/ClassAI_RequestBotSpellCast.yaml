  class: ClassAI
  method: RequestBotSpellCast
  signature: bool ClassAI::RequestBotSpellCast(int spellId, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Requests the bot to cast a specified spell on a target.
  description: The RequestBotSpellCast method is used to initiate a spell casting
    action for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. It attempts to queue
    and execute a spell based on the provided spell ID, targeting the specified unit.
    The method returns true if the spell request was successfully processed and queued,
    or false if the spell could not be cast due to various conditions such as invalid
    spell ID, target restrictions, or casting requirements. This method is typically
    used in AI logic to control bot behavior during combat or non-combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be cast. Must correspond to
      a valid spell entry in the database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that the spell should be cast on. Can
      be null if the spell targets self or area.
  returns: Returns true if the spell request was successfully queued for casting,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the spell is invalid, the target
    is unreachable, or the bot cannot currently cast the spell due to state restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Casting Request
    code: "if (botAI->RequestBotSpellCast(12345, &targetUnit)) {\n    // Spell casting\
      \ initiated successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Spell cast requested\");\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Failed to request spell cast\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed\
      \ to request spell cast\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Self-Cast Spell Request
    code: "Unit* self = botAI->GetBot();\nif (botAI->RequestBotSpellCast(67890, nullptr))\
      \ {\n    // Self-cast spell initiated\n    sLog->outString(\"Self-cast spell\
      \ requested\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of the AI system and may not immediately
    execute the spell. The actual casting behavior depends on the bot's current state,
    line of sight, mana availability, and other game mechanics. It is recommended
    to check if the spell can be cast before calling this method to avoid unnecessary
    processing.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of spellId or target may
    result in undefined behavior or failed spell casts. Ensure that the spell ID exists
    in the database and that the target unit is valid before invoking this method.
