  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: WeekendHolidayIdToBGType
  signature: int BattlegroundMgr::WeekendHolidayIdToBGType(int holiday)
documentation:
  brief: Converts a weekend holiday ID to its corresponding battleground type identifier.
  description: The WeekendHolidayIdToBGType method maps a specific weekend holiday
    identifier to the associated battleground type. This conversion is used internally
    by the BattlegroundMgr to determine which battleground template should be used
    for a given weekend holiday event. The method likely handles special holiday weekends
    such as those during PvP events or seasonal celebrations where specific battlegrounds
    are enabled. It serves as a lookup mechanism that allows the system to dynamically
    assign battleground types based on holiday configurations.
  parameters:
  - name: holiday
    description: The weekend holiday identifier to convert. This typically corresponds
      to a specific holiday entry in the game's holiday database, such as those related
      to PvP weekends or seasonal events.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the battleground type ID associated with
    the provided weekend holiday. If no matching battleground type is found for the
    given holiday, it may return -1 or a default value indicating an invalid mapping.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int bgType = sBattlegroundMgr->WeekendHolidayIdToBGType(42); // Convert
      holiday ID 42 to battleground type
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic with Return Value
    code: "int holidayId = 105; \nint bgType = sBattlegroundMgr->WeekendHolidayIdToBGType(holidayId);\
      \ \nif (bgType >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with battleground creation or assignment\n\
      \    sBattlegroundMgr->CreateBattleground(bgType);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid holiday mapping\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid weekend holiday ID:\
      \ %d\", holidayId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages dynamic battleground
    assignments during special events. It may be called during battleground initialization
    or when checking if a specific holiday weekend should activate a particular battleground
    type.
  warnings: Ensure the provided holiday ID corresponds to an actual weekend holiday
    in the game's database, otherwise the method might return an invalid battleground
    type or cause unexpected behavior in battleground assignment logic.
