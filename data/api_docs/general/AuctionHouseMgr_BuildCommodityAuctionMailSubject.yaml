  signature: int AuctionHouseMgr::BuildCommodityAuctionMailSubject(AuctionMailType
    type, uint32 itemId, uint32 itemCount)
documentation:
  brief: Constructs and returns a formatted auction mail subject string for commodity
    auctions in the auction house system.
  description: The BuildCommodityAuctionMailSubject method generates a standardized
    subject line for auction house mails related to commodity items. It takes an auction
    mail type, item identifier, and item count to construct a properly formatted subject
    string that is used when sending automated auction-related notifications to players.
    This method is typically invoked during auction processing to ensure consistent
    messaging across different auction outcomes such as successful sales or expired
    auctions. The returned integer likely represents the length of the constructed
    string or an error code if the operation fails.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: Specifies the type of auction mail to be generated. This determines
      the context and formatting of the subject line, such as 'successful sale', 'expired
      auction', or 'bid placed'. Valid values are defined by the AuctionMailType enumeration.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the commodity item involved in the auction.
      This ID corresponds to entries in the game's item database and is used to reference
      the specific item being auctioned or sold.
  - name: itemCount
    description: The quantity of the specified item that is part of the auction. For
      commodities, this typically represents how many units are being sold or purchased
      in the transaction.
  returns: Returns an integer representing either the length of the constructed subject
    string, or a negative error code if the operation fails. A positive return value
    indicates successful construction of the subject line.
  examples:
  - title: Constructing a Successful Sale Mail Subject
    code: int subjectLength = auctionHouseMgr->BuildCommodityAuctionMailSubject(AUCTION_MAIL_TYPE_SUCCESSFUL_SALE,
      12345, 10);
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating an Expired Auction Subject Line
    code: int subjectLength = auctionHouseMgr->BuildCommodityAuctionMailSubject(AUCTION_MAIL_TYPE_EXPIRED,
      67890, 5);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal auction house mail system and should
    only be called during auction processing events. The subject line format may vary
    depending on the AuctionMailType parameter, and developers must ensure that all
    required parameters are valid before calling this function.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of invalid AuctionMailType values or null item identifiers
    can lead to undefined behavior or malformed mail subjects. Ensure proper validation
    of inputs before invoking this method.
