documentation:
  brief: Sets the major category for a complaint ticket.
  description: The SetMajorCategory method assigns a major category to a complaint
    ticket, which helps classify and route the ticket appropriately within the TrinityCore
    system. This method is typically used when creating or updating a complaint ticket
    to specify its primary subject area. The major category determines how the ticket
    will be processed and which administrators or departments will handle it. This
    classification is crucial for maintaining organized reporting and ensuring that
    complaints are directed to the correct team for resolution.
  parameters:
  - name: majorCategory
    description: The ReportMajorCategory enum value representing the primary subject
      area of the complaint ticket. Valid values include categories such as 'PlayerBehavior',
      'GameBug', 'AccountIssue', and others defined in the ReportMajorCategory enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player Behavior Category
    code: 'ComplaintTicket* ticket = new ComplaintTicket();

      ticket->SetMajorCategory(ReportMajorCategory::PlayerBehavior);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Ticket Category Based on Report Type
    code: "ComplaintTicket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\nif\
      \ (ticket)\n{\n    if (reportType == \"Bug\")\n        ticket->SetMajorCategory(ReportMajorCategory::GameBug);\n\
      \    else if (reportType == \"Cheating\")\n        ticket->SetMajorCategory(ReportMajorCategory::PlayerBehavior);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the complaint ticket.
    It should be called before the ticket is submitted or processed to ensure proper
    categorization. The major category value must be a valid enum member from ReportMajorCategory;
    invalid values may result in undefined behavior or default classification.
  warnings: Calling this method after a ticket has been submitted for processing may
    not update the ticket's routing correctly. Always verify that the major category
    is set before finalizing the ticket submission. Improper use of this method could
    lead to misclassification of complaints and delayed resolution.
