  brief: Updates the augmentation buffs for the evoker class
  description: The UpdateBuffs method manages the application, refresh, and removal
    of augmentation buffs specific to the evoker class. This method is typically invoked
    during combat updates or when buff conditions change. It ensures that the evoker's
    augmentation effects are properly maintained according to game mechanics and cooldown
    rules. The method handles internal state management for buff durations, stacking
    limits, and visual effects associated with evoker augmentations.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void EvokerAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_evoker->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat or when buff states
    are expected to change. It's typically invoked from the main update loop or triggered
    by specific evoker abilities that modify buff states.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate contexts may result in incorrect
    buff state management or visual inconsistencies. Ensure proper synchronization
    with combat state changes.
