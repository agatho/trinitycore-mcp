  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the SystemMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the SystemMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the system manager exists throughout
    the TrinityCore server runtime. This method is commonly used to access global
    system management functionality such as configuration handling, server state management,
    and core system operations. The returned pointer is guaranteed to be valid during
    server operation and should not be deleted by the caller. This method is thread-safe
    and can be called from any context within the server's execution flow.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of SystemMgr. The return value is never
    null during normal server operation, as the singleton is initialized during server
    startup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SystemMgr* systemMgr = SystemMgr::instance();

      // Use systemMgr to access global system functions'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Configuration
    code: 'SystemMgr* mgr = SystemMgr::instance();

      uint32 maxPlayers = mgr->GetMaxPlayers();

      bool isPvPEnabled = mgr->IsPvPEnabled();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The SystemMgr
    instance is created and managed internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    server initialization. Developers should not attempt to create or destroy instances
    of SystemMgr directly.
  warnings: Do not store references to the returned pointer beyond the scope where
    the singleton remains valid. While the singleton is guaranteed to exist during
    normal operation, avoid caching the pointer in static variables that might outlive
    the system manager's lifetime.
