  class: ExtendedPlayerName
  method: ExtendedPlayerName
  signature: void ExtendedPlayerName::ExtendedPlayerName(const std::string & name,
    const std::string & realmName)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ExtendedPlayerName object with the specified player name
    and realm name.
  description: The ExtendedPlayerName constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ExtendedPlayerName class by setting its internal name and realm name properties.
    This class is typically used to represent player identifiers in a more detailed
    format than standard player names, including realm information. The constructor
    validates that both parameters are non-empty strings before assigning them to
    internal member variables. This allows for proper handling of player references
    across different realms within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The player's character name. Must be a non-empty string representing
      the character's display name in the game world.
  - name: realmName
    description: The realm name where the player resides. Must be a non-empty string
      identifying the specific game realm.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'ExtendedPlayerName playerName("Shadowmoon", "Area 52");

      // Creates an ExtendedPlayerName object for player ''Shadowmoon'' on realm ''Area
      52'''
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Player Data
    code: 'std::string playerName = "Thrall";

      std::string realmName = "Azeroth";

      ExtendedPlayerName player(playerName, realmName);

      // Initializes ExtendedPlayerName using variables from player data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when processing player-related data. The class likely implements proper string
    validation and may include additional methods for serialization or comparison
    operations.
  warnings: Ensure that both name and realmName parameters are valid non-empty strings
    to avoid undefined behavior. This constructor does not perform any automatic sanitization
    of input strings, so callers should validate inputs appropriately.
