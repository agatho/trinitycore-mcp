documentation:
  brief: Initializes the safe execution engine for handling asynchronous operations
    and thread-safe code execution within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state of the SafeExecutionEngine
    class, preparing it to manage concurrent execution contexts and ensure thread
    safety for operations that may be invoked from multiple threads. This method typically
    configures thread pools, initializes synchronization primitives, and prepares
    the engine to handle queued tasks or callbacks. It is designed to be called once
    during system initialization before any other methods in the engine are used.
    The initialization process ensures that subsequent calls to execution methods
    will operate correctly within a controlled and safe environment.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'SafeExecutionEngine engine;

      engine.Initialize();

      // Engine is now ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application's lifecycle.
    Multiple calls to Initialize may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks.
    The engine assumes that it will be used in a multi-threaded environment, so proper
    synchronization mechanisms are established during initialization.
