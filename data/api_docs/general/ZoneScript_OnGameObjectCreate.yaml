documentation:
  brief: Called when a game object is created within the zone script's area of influence
  description: The OnGameObjectCreate method is a virtual callback function that gets
    invoked whenever a GameObject is successfully created and added to the world within
    the scope of a ZoneScript. This method allows developers to execute custom logic
    or perform initialization tasks when specific game objects appear in their designated
    zone. It serves as an event handler for object creation, enabling dynamic behavior
    based on the presence of certain objects. The method is typically used for setting
    up initial states, registering objects with other systems, or triggering quest-related
    events when objects are spawned.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the GameObject that was created. This parameter provides
      access to all properties and methods of the newly created game object, allowing
      for manipulation or inspection of its state.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Object Creation Handler
    code: "class MyZoneScript : public ZoneScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnGameObjectCreate(GameObject*\
      \ go) override\n    {\n        if (go->GetEntry() == 12345)\n        {\n   \
      \         // Perform custom logic when this specific object is created\n   \
      \         go->SetFlag(GO_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n        }\n    }\n};"

  - title: Quest Trigger on Object Spawn
    code: "class QuestZoneScript : public ZoneScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnGameObjectCreate(GameObject*\
      \ go) override\n    {\n        if (go->GetEntry() == 30001)\n        {\n   \
      \         // Trigger quest event when this object is created\n            for\
      \ (auto& player : GetPlayersInZone())\n            {\n                if (player\
      \ && player->GetQuestStatus(5001) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n            \
      \    {\n                    player->AreaExploredOrEventHappens(5001);\n    \
      \            }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called during the GameObject's initialization process, so
    it's important to ensure that any operations performed do not interfere with the
    object's creation sequence. The ZoneScript instance must be properly registered
    with the zone for this callback to be invoked.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations within this
    method as it may impact performance during world loading and object creation.
    Also, be cautious when modifying the GameObject's state, as changes might affect
    other systems that depend on the object's initial configuration.
