  brief: Removes movement impairing auras from the unit, allowing free movement.
  description: This method removes all auras that impair movement, such as root, slow,
    or other movement restriction effects. It is commonly used in combat situations
    where a unit needs to be freed from movement restrictions. The method can optionally
    remove root auras specifically, depending on the parameter value. This operation
    typically occurs during combat or when a unit needs to regain mobility after being
    affected by movement impairing effects.

  notes: This method is typically called during combat situations or when a unit needs
    to be freed from movement restrictions. It may affect the unit's movement speed
    and ability to perform actions that require mobility.
  warnings: Be cautious when calling this method in combat, as removing movement impairing
    auras might cause the unit to become vulnerable to attacks or spells that would
    otherwise be restricted by movement effects.
