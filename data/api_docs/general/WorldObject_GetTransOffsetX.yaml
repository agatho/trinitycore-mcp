  class: WorldObject
  method: GetTransOffsetX
  signature: float WorldObject::GetTransOffsetX() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the X-axis offset of the object's transport transformation.
  description: The GetTransOffsetX method retrieves the X-coordinate offset applied
    to this WorldObject due to its position on a moving transport, such as a boat
    or elevator. This value represents how far the object has been shifted from its
    original location within the transport's local coordinate system. The method is
    typically used in conjunction with other transport-related offset getters (GetTransOffsetY,
    GetTransOffsetZ) to accurately determine an object's global position when it is
    mounted on a transport vehicle. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper positioning of players and creatures while they are aboard moving game
    objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the X-axis offset in world coordinates. This
    value may be positive or negative, depending on the object's position relative
    to the transport's origin point.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve transport offset for positioning calculations
    code: 'float x_offset = player->GetTransOffsetX();

      float y_offset = player->GetTransOffsetY();

      float z_offset = player->GetTransOffsetZ();

      // Use these offsets to calculate actual world position when on transport'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only returns meaningful values when the object is actually mounted
    on a transport. When not on a transport, the returned value typically represents
    the local offset from the transport's origin, which may be zero or a small value
    depending on implementation details.
