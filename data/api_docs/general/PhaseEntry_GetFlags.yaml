documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with a phase entry for determining phase
    behavior and visibility.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    flags of a PhaseEntry object. These flags define various properties and behaviors
    of the phase, such as whether it's visible to players, if it's a temporary phase,
    or if it should be excluded from certain gameplay mechanics. In TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, phases are used extensively for controlling which
    areas, objects, or events are visible or active for players based on their current
    quest progress, achievements, or other game states. The returned integer value
    can be evaluated using bitwise operations to check specific flag conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of flags associated with this phase
    entry. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific phase behavior or property
    (e.g., visibility, temporary status, etc.).
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a phase is temporary
    code: "PhaseEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetPhaseEntry(1234);\nif (entry && (entry->GetFlags()\
      \ & PHASE_FLAG_TEMPORARY))\n{\n    // This phase is temporary and will be removed\
      \ after certain conditions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combining multiple flag checks
    code: "PhaseEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetPhaseEntry(5678);\nint flags = entry->GetFlags();\n\
      if (flags & PHASE_FLAG_VISIBLE && !(flags & PHASE_FLAG_HIDDEN))\n{\n    // Phase\
      \ is visible and not hidden\n    // Can be used to determine if objects in this\
      \ phase should be shown to players\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact meaning of individual flag bits may vary depending on the TrinityCore
    version and implementation. Developers should consult the relevant header files
    or documentation for specific flag definitions (e.g., PHASE_FLAG_VISIBLE, PHASE_FLAG_TEMPORARY).
    The returned value is typically used in conjunction with bitwise operations to
    evaluate multiple conditions efficiently.
  warnings: Do not modify the return value directly as it's a const method. If you
    need to change phase flags, use appropriate setter methods or modify the underlying
    data structure. Incorrectly interpreting flag values can lead to unexpected visibility
    or gameplay behavior for players.
