  class: InteractionManager
  method: GetVendorItems
  signature: int InteractionManager::GetVendorItems(Creature * vendor) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of items available for purchase from a vendor creature.
  description: The GetVendorItems method fetches all items currently offered by a
    specified vendor creature. It returns an integer representing the number of items
    in the vendor's inventory. This method is essential for interacting with NPC vendors
    in World of Warcraft, allowing scripts and AI logic to access what goods are available
    for sale. The method operates on the Creature object passed as a parameter and
    retrieves its associated vendor item data from the game's database or internal
    structures. It does not modify any state but provides read-only access to vendor
    inventory information.
  parameters:
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor NPC whose
      items are being retrieved. Must be a valid pointer to an active vendor creature,
      otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the total count of items available for purchase
    from the specified vendor. A return value of zero indicates that the vendor has
    no items in stock or the vendor object is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Vendor Item Count
    code: "Creature* vendor = ...; // Assume this points to a valid vendor\nint itemCount\
      \ = interactionManager.GetVendorItems(vendor);\nif (itemCount > 0) {\n    //\
      \ Vendor has items available for purchase\n    printf(\"Vendor has %d items\
      \ for sale\\n\", itemCount);\n} else {\n    // No items or invalid vendor\n\
      \    printf(\"Vendor has no items or is invalid\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Vendor Item Count to Iterate Through Items
    code: "Creature* vendor = ...; // Assume this points to a valid vendor\nint itemCount\
      \ = interactionManager.GetVendorItems(vendor);\nif (itemCount > 0) {\n    for\
      \ (int i = 0; i < itemCount; ++i) {\n        // Access item information using\
      \ vendor's item list or related methods\n        // Note: Actual item access\
      \ would require additional API calls\n        printf(\"Item %d is available\\\
      n\", i);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal vendor data structure of the Creature
    object. It assumes that the vendor has been properly initialized with its item
    list from the database or server configuration. The returned integer count can
    be used to determine how many items are available for iteration, but direct item
    access requires additional methods or structures not exposed by this function
    alone.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid Creature object may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate that the vendor pointer is valid before calling
    this method. The method does not perform any locking or thread safety checks,
    so ensure it's called from a safe context in multi-threaded environments.
