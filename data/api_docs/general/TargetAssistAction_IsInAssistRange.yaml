documentation:
  brief: Checks if a target unit is within the assist range of a player bot
  description: The IsInAssistRange method determines whether a specified target unit
    is within the valid assist range for a given player bot. This functionality is
    crucial for AI behavior in TrinityCore's bot system, ensuring that bots only engage
    or assist with targets that are close enough to be effectively supported. The
    method evaluates the distance between the bot and the target unit using game-defined
    assist range parameters, which may vary based on the bot's class, level, or other
    factors. This check is typically used in conjunction with targeting logic to prevent
    bots from attempting to assist or attack targets that are too far away.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is checking
      assist range. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target being checked
      for assist range validity. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is within the assist range of the bot,
    false otherwise. The method returns false if either parameter is invalid or if
    the distance exceeds the defined assist range threshold.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (TargetAssistAction::IsInAssistRange(bot, target)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with assist actions\n    bot->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ASSIST, true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Move closer or select a different target\n    bot->MoveTowards(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with bot decision making
    code: "class MyBotAI : public PlayerbotAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (GetTarget() && !TargetAssistAction::IsInAssistRange(GetBot(),\
      \ GetTarget())) {\n            // Target is out of assist range, reposition\n\
      \            SetNextAction(new MoveToAction(GetBot(), GetTarget()));\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal game mechanics for determining assist
    range, which may include factors such as spell range, bot class abilities, and
    server configuration settings. The implementation likely uses distance calculations
    based on the 3D coordinates of both units, taking into account terrain and obstacles
    where applicable.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and target pointers are valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. This method does not perform any null
    pointer checks internally, so callers must validate inputs.
