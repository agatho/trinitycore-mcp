  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: GetRecommendedQuests
  signature: int DynamicQuestSystem::GetRecommendedQuests(Player * bot, QuestStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of recommended quests for the specified player based on
    their current progress and quest strategy.
  description: The GetRecommendedQuests method evaluates the player's current quest
    progress, level, faction, and other relevant factors to determine and return a
    list of quests that are recommended for them to complete next. The method uses
    the provided QuestStrategy parameter to define how recommendations should be prioritized
    or filtered. It is commonly used in automated questing systems or AI-driven bot
    behavior within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. This method may modify
    internal state related to quest tracking and can return zero if no suitable quests
    are found for the player's current status.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character for whom
      recommended quests are being retrieved. Must not be null.
  - name: strategy
    description: An enum value of type QuestStrategy that defines how quest recommendations
      should be prioritized or filtered (e.g., by level, faction, proximity, or reward
      type).
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of recommended quests found
    and added to the internal list for the player. Returns zero if no suitable quests
    are available based on the provided strategy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get recommended quests
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nQuestStrategy strategy\
      \ = QuestStrategy::LEVEL_BASED;\nint numQuests = dynamicQuestSystem->GetRecommendedQuests(player,\
      \ strategy);\nif (numQuests > 0)\n{\n    // Process the recommended quests\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using different quest strategies for varied recommendations
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      QuestStrategy strategy1 = QuestStrategy::FACTION_BASED;

      QuestStrategy strategy2 = QuestStrategy::REWARD_TYPE;

      int factionQuests = dynamicQuestSystem->GetRecommendedQuests(player, strategy1);

      int rewardQuests = dynamicQuestSystem->GetRecommendedQuests(player, strategy2);

      // Use both sets of quests accordingly'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest database and player's current quest
    log to make recommendations. Ensure that the player object is valid and has been
    initialized properly before calling this method. The returned number of quests
    may vary depending on the strategy used and the state of the player's quest progression.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Additionally, if QuestStrategy values are not properly defined
    or supported by the system, the results may be inconsistent or empty.
