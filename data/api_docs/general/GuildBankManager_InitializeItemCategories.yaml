  brief: Initializes item category mappings for the guild bank system
  description: The InitializeItemCategories method sets up internal data structures
    that map item types to their respective categories within the guild bank system.
    This method is typically called during server initialization or when loading guild
    bank configurations to ensure that items can be properly categorized and accessed
    by guild members. It establishes the foundational category hierarchy used for
    organizing guild bank items, filtering, and display purposes in the game interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.InitializeItemCategories();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. It is
    not thread-safe and must be executed on the main game thread to ensure proper
    synchronization of item category data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate category entries
    or memory leaks. Do not invoke this method after guild bank operations have begun
    as it could corrupt existing category mappings.
