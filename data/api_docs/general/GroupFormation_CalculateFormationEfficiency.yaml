  class: GroupFormation
  method: CalculateFormationEfficiency
  signature: float GroupFormation::CalculateFormationEfficiency() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the efficiency rating of a group formation based on
    member positioning and role distribution.
  description: The CalculateFormationEfficiency method evaluates how effectively a
    group's members are arranged according to their roles and positioning within the
    game world. This calculation takes into account factors such as distance between
    group members, role balance (tank, healer, damage dealer), and positional alignment
    relative to objectives or combat zones. The result is a normalized float value
    typically ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 represents an ideal formation and
    0.0 indicates a highly inefficient arrangement. This method is primarily used
    by the game's AI systems and group management logic to optimize player performance
    during raids, dungeons, or PvP scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the efficiency of the group
    formation. A value closer to 1.0 indicates a more optimal positioning and role
    distribution, while values near 0.0 suggest poor formation setup that may hinder
    performance in combat situations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float efficiency = groupFormation->CalculateFormationEfficiency();\nif\
      \ (efficiency < 0.5f)\n{\n    // Notify players of suboptimal formation\n  \
      \  SendSystemMessage(\"Your group formation is inefficient.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Optimization Check
    code: "GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\nfloat\
      \ efficiency = formation->CalculateFormationEfficiency();\nif (efficiency >\
      \ 0.8f)\n{\n    // Apply performance bonuses\n    player->ApplyFormationBonus();\n\
      }\nelse if (efficiency < 0.3f)\n{\n    // Suggest repositioning\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Consider adjusting your group formation for better efficiency.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations based on current group member positions
    and roles, so it should be called after any significant changes to group composition
    or positioning. The calculation may involve complex spatial algorithms and could
    have performance implications if called too frequently in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: The returned value is not guaranteed to be stable across multiple calls
    due to dynamic nature of group positioning. Avoid making critical gameplay decisions
    based solely on this efficiency score without considering other factors such as
    player skill, gear, or environmental conditions.
