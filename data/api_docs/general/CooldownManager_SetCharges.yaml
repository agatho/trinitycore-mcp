  class: CooldownManager
  method: SetCharges
  signature: void CooldownManager::SetCharges(uint32 spellId, uint32 current, uint32
    maximum, uint32 rechargeTimeMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the charge count and recharge time for a specified spell cooldown.
  description: The SetCharges method configures the charge state of a spell cooldown,
    allowing developers to control how many times a spell can be used before entering
    a cooldown period. This method is typically used in custom spell implementations
    or when modifying existing spell behaviors. It updates both the current and maximum
    charge counts, as well as the recharge time for the specified spell ID. The method
    directly affects the player's ability to use the spell and is essential for implementing
    abilities with limited uses per reset period.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell whose cooldown charges are being
      modified. Must correspond to a valid spell in the game database.
  - name: current
    description: The current number of charges available for the spell. Should be
      less than or equal to the maximum charge count.
  - name: maximum
    description: The maximum number of charges that can be accumulated for this spell.
      Defines the upper limit of how many times the spell can be used before needing
      to recharge.
  - name: rechargeTimeMs
    description: The time in milliseconds that must pass before a charge is replenished.
      A value of 0 indicates no recharge delay or infinite charges.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting up a spell with 3 charges and 10 second recharge
    code: cooldownManager->SetCharges(12345, 3, 3, 10000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting a spell to have no charges available but with a 5-second recharge
    code: cooldownManager->SetCharges(67890, 0, 2, 5000);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the CooldownManager instance and directly modifies
    internal spell cooldown tracking. It should be called carefully to avoid disrupting
    existing game mechanics or causing unexpected behavior in player abilities. The
    recharge time is measured in milliseconds and affects how quickly charges are
    restored.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the maximum charge count higher than intended may
    lead to exploits where players can use spells excessively. Setting a zero recharge
    time with non-zero charges will result in unlimited usage of the spell until manually
    reset.
