  signature: int Battlefield::GetBattleId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the battlefield instance.
  description: The GetBattleId method retrieves the unique integer identifier associated
    with a specific battlefield instance. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore
    to distinguish between different battlefield engagements, such as those in Wintergrasp
    or other contested zones. The returned value typically corresponds to the battlefield's
    entry in the database and is essential for managing battlefield-related operations
    like player registration, zone control, and reward distribution. This method does
    not require any parameters and always returns a valid integer ID for active battlefields.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique battlefield identifier. This value corresponds
    to the battlefield's entry in the game's database and is used to differentiate
    between various battlefield instances within the TrinityCore framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    int battleId = bf->GetBattleId();\n    // Use battleId for further\
      \ battlefield operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called on active Battlefield objects that have been
    properly initialized. The returned ID should be treated as a constant value during
    the lifetime of the battlefield instance.
