documentation:
  brief: Returns the cost amount of a specified power type for this spell
  description: This method retrieves the cost amount associated with a specific power
    type for the current spell. It is commonly used to determine how much mana, rage,
    focus, or other resources are required to cast a spell. The method returns an
    integer value representing the power cost, which can be zero if the spell doesn't
    require any power or if the specified power type is not applicable. This functionality
    is essential for implementing game mechanics related to resource management and
    spell casting requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the cost amount of the specified
    power type. If the spell does not require the given power type, or if no power
    cost is associated with it, the method returns zero. The returned value may be
    negative in some cases for spells that refund power.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int manaCost = spell->GetPowerTypeCostAmount(PowerType::POWER_MANA);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine resource requirements for casting. It's important to note that the
    returned value might be zero even if a spell has a cost, as some spells may not
    require power for certain power types.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only returns the cost amount for one specific
    power type; it does not return all costs for all power types. Also, if the spell
    doesn't require any power, or if the specified power type is not applicable, the
    returned value will be zero.
