  class: ConversationActor
  method: operator==
  signature: bool ConversationActor::operator==(const ConversationActor & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ConversationActor objects for equality based on their underlying
    identifiers.
  description: The operator== method performs a comparison between this ConversationActor
    instance and another ConversationActor object to determine if they represent the
    same actor within a conversation context. This comparison is typically based on
    internal unique identifiers or references that distinguish one actor from another
    in the game's conversation system. The method returns true if both objects refer
    to the same actor, and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for managing
    conversation flow, ensuring correct targeting of actors during dialogue sequences,
    and preventing duplicate or incorrect interactions within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The ConversationActor object to compare against this instance. This
      parameter represents another actor in a conversation that will be compared for
      equality with the current actor.
  returns: Returns true if both ConversationActor objects refer to the same underlying
    actor (based on internal identifiers), and false otherwise. A return value of
    true indicates that the two objects represent identical actors within the conversation
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two conversation actors
    code: 'ConversationActor actor1;

      ConversationActor actor2;

      bool areEqual = (actor1 == actor2); // Returns true if both actors refer to
      the same entity'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using equality operator in a conversation flow condition
    code: "void HandleConversationStep(ConversationActor& currentActor, ConversationActor&\
      \ targetActor) {\n    if (currentActor == targetActor) {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with the conversation step as the actors match\n        SendDialogue(\"You\
      \ are speaking to yourself!\");\n    } else {\n        // Different actors involved\
      \ in the interaction\n        SendDialogue(\"Who are you talking to?\");\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely compares internal GUIDs or unique identifiers associated
    with each actor rather than their visual or textual properties. This ensures that
    even if two actors have similar appearances or names, they are correctly distinguished
    when performing equality checks.
