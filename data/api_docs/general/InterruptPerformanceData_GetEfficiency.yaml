  brief: Calculates and returns the interrupt performance efficiency rating of a player
  description: The GetEfficiency method computes a normalized efficiency score for
    a player's interrupt performance, typically used in combat analysis or performance
    tracking systems. This value represents how effectively a player interrupts enemy
    spell casts relative to their total interrupt attempts. The calculation may consider
    factors such as successful interrupts, total attempts, and possibly timing or
    spell type variations. The returned float value is usually normalized between
    0.0 (no efficiency) and 1.0 (perfect efficiency), though exact range depends on
    internal implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the interrupt performance efficiency,
    typically ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 where 0.0 indicates no successful interrupts
    and 1.0 indicates perfect interrupt efficiency. Values may exceed 1.0 in certain
    edge cases or if normalization is based on idealized benchmarks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptPerformanceData data;

      float efficiency = data.GetEfficiency();

      printf("Player interrupt efficiency: %.2f%%\n", efficiency * 100.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis
    code: "void AnalyzeInterrupts(Player* player) {\n    InterruptPerformanceData&\
      \ perf = player->GetInterruptPerformance();\n    float efficiency = perf.GetEfficiency();\n\
      \    if (efficiency >= 0.9f) {\n        // Excellent interrupt performance\n\
      \        SendSystemMessage(player, \"Excellent interrupt performance!\");\n\
      \    } else if (efficiency >= 0.7f) {\n        // Good performance\n       \
      \ SendSystemMessage(player, \"Good interrupt performance.\");\n    } else {\n\
      \        // Needs improvement\n        SendSystemMessage(player, \"Consider\
      \ improving your interrupt timing.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations involving interrupt statistics that
    are updated during combat. The efficiency calculation may be influenced by factors
    such as spell school, target type, or player specialization. It's recommended
    to cache the result if called frequently in performance-critical sections.
  warnings: The returned value is a floating-point number and should not be compared
    for exact equality due to potential floating-point precision issues. The method
    assumes that interrupt statistics have been properly initialized and updated before
    calling.
