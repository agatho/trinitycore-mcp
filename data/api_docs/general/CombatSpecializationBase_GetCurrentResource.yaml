documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current resource value of the combat specialization.
  description: The GetCurrentResource method returns the current amount of resource
    associated with the combat specialization. This value typically represents the
    player's current resource level, such as rage, energy, or focus, depending on
    the specialization. The returned value is used by the game engine to determine
    whether abilities can be cast and how much resource is available for special actions.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current resource amount. The specific meaning
    of this value depends on the combat specialization, such as rage points for Warriors
    or energy for Rogues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 currentResource = player->GetCombatSpecialization()->GetCurrentResource();\n\
      if (currentResource >= 10)\n{\n    // Player has enough resource to cast an\
      \ ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat state updates or when checking
    pre-conditions for ability usage. It's important to note that the returned value
    may change frequently during gameplay as resources are consumed and regenerated.
