  method: InitializeAI
  signature: bool BotWorldEntry::InitializeAI()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AI component for a bot world entry, setting up necessary
    data structures and configurations.
  description: The InitializeAI method prepares the AI system for a bot world entry
    by allocating required resources, initializing internal state variables, and configuring
    AI behavior parameters. This method is typically called during the creation or
    activation of a bot instance within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that
    all prerequisite conditions are met before the AI can begin functioning properly.
    The method performs essential setup operations such as loading AI scripts, initializing
    behavior trees, and establishing communication channels with the game world. If
    initialization fails due to missing dependencies or invalid configurations, the
    method returns false, indicating that the AI system is not ready for use.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI initialization was successful and all required components
    were properly set up; otherwise returns false if initialization failed due to
    errors or missing prerequisites.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Initialization
    code: "BotWorldEntry* entry = new BotWorldEntry();\nif (entry->InitializeAI())\
      \ {\n    // AI is ready for use\n    entry->StartAI();\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ initialization failure\n    LogError(\"Failed to initialize AI for bot entry\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per BotWorldEntry instance. Repeated
    calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method assumes that
    the underlying game world context and required subsystems are already initialized.
  warnings: Calling InitializeAI on an already initialized entry may cause memory
    corruption or inconsistent AI states. Always check the return value before using
    the AI system.
