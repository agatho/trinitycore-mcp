documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current resource pressure level for the system
  description: The GetPressureLevel method returns the current ResourcePressure enum
    value that represents the system's resource utilization state. This metric is
    used internally by TrinityCore to monitor and manage server performance, particularly
    in relation to memory and CPU usage. The returned value indicates whether the
    system is under normal operation, experiencing light pressure, moderate pressure,
    or heavy pressure conditions. This method does not modify any internal state and
    is safe for repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ResourcePressure enum value indicating the current system resource pressure
    level. Possible values include NORMAL, LIGHT_PRESSURE, MODERATE_PRESSURE, and
    HEAVY_PRESSURE depending on current resource utilization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ResourceMetrics metrics;\nResourcePressure pressure = metrics.GetPressureLevel();\n\
      switch (pressure) {\n    case ResourcePressure::NORMAL:\n        // Handle normal\
      \ operation\n        break;\n    case ResourcePressure::LIGHT_PRESSURE:\n  \
      \      // Handle light pressure\n        break;\n    case ResourcePressure::MODERATE_PRESSURE:\n\
      \        // Handle moderate pressure\n        break;\n    case ResourcePressure::HEAVY_PRESSURE:\n\
      \        // Handle heavy pressure\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for internal performance monitoring and may
    be called frequently during server operation. The implementation likely uses sampling
    techniques to avoid performance overhead from frequent system checks.
