documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FacingInfo class with default values.
  description: The FacingInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the FacingInfo
    class, setting up internal state with default values. This method is typically
    called when creating a new FacingInfo object to ensure all member variables are
    properly initialized before use. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    FacingInfo likely represents information about an object's facing direction or
    orientation within the game world. The constructor ensures that the object starts
    in a valid, predictable state, which is essential for maintaining consistency
    in game mechanics such as NPC behavior, player movement, or object positioning.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Construction of FacingInfo
    code: 'FacingInfo info;

      // Constructs a new FacingInfo object with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor, so no parameters are required. The constructor
    should be called before any other methods on the FacingInfo object to ensure proper
    initialization. In TrinityCore, objects of this type may be used in various subsystems
    that require directional information for entities.
