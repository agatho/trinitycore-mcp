  method: InitializeTriggers
  signature: void SoloCombatStrategy::InitializeTriggers()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the triggers for solo combat behavior in the AI strategy.
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up and configures all necessary
    event triggers that govern how a player character behaves during solo combat scenarios.
    This method is typically called during the initialization phase of a SoloCombatStrategy
    instance, establishing the conditions under which various combat actions will
    be executed. It defines the sequence and priority of trigger events such as enemy
    detection, health thresholds, mana levels, and spell casting conditions. The method
    ensures that the AI has a complete set of rules to determine appropriate responses
    when engaging in solo combat situations within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'SoloCombatStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeTriggers();

      // Triggers are now configured for solo combat behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the strategy's initialization
    lifecycle. It is typically invoked automatically by the AI system when a new SoloCombatStrategy
    instance is created, but may also be manually called if trigger reconfiguration
    is needed. The method does not return any value and modifies internal state variables
    of the strategy object.
