documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map entry represents a non-raid dungeon instance type.
  description: The IsNonRaidDungeon method checks if the current MapEntry corresponds
    to a dungeon that is not part of a raid instance. This includes normal and heroic
    dungeons, but excludes raid instances such as those found in Outland or Northrend.
    The method evaluates internal flags and map types to determine if the map qualifies
    as a non-raid dungeon. It's commonly used in game logic to differentiate between
    player-versus-player content, solo dungeon content, and group raid content. This
    check is essential for determining appropriate difficulty scaling, loot distribution,
    and quest availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map entry represents a non-raid dungeon (such as a
    normal or heroic dungeon), false otherwise. This includes instances like the Deadmines,
    Shadowfang Keep, and other similar dungeon content that are not part of raid instances.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if Map is Non-Raid Dungeon
    code: "if (mapEntry->IsNonRaidDungeon())\n{\n    // Handle logic specific to non-raid\
      \ dungeons\n    printf(\"This map is a non-raid dungeon\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Player Instance Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerEnterMap(Player* player, MapEntry const* mapEntry)\n{\n\
      \    if (mapEntry->IsNonRaidDungeon())\n    {\n        // Apply dungeon-specific\
      \ rules\n        player->SetGroupType(GROUP_TYPE_DUNGEON);\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle raid or other instance types\n        player->SetGroupType(GROUP_TYPE_RAID);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal map flags and type definitions within the
    TrinityCore database. The implementation checks against predefined dungeon types
    and does not dynamically evaluate instance content. Developers should be aware
    that this method returns false for all raid instances including 10-player and
    25-player raids, as well as heroic versions of those raids.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player can enter an instance;
    it only identifies the map type. Always validate player permissions and requirements
    before allowing entry into any instance. The method may return false for instances
    that are technically dungeons but have special flags or are designated as raid
    content in the database.
