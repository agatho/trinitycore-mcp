  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: CreateBehaviorSample
  signature: BehaviorSample PlayerPatternRecognition::CreateBehaviorSample(Player
    * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a behavior sample from the specified player for pattern
    recognition analysis.
  description: The CreateBehaviorSample method generates a BehaviorSample object that
    encapsulates various behavioral metrics and data points from a given Player instance.
    This functionality is typically used within the context of AI-driven pattern recognition
    systems to analyze player actions, movement patterns, interaction sequences, and
    other gameplay behaviors. The returned sample can be utilized for machine learning
    models, anti-cheat systems, or behavioral profiling mechanisms. The method does
    not modify the original player object but rather extracts a snapshot of their
    current state and behavior characteristics at the time of sampling.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BehaviorSample object containing collected behavioral data points from
    the player, including movement patterns, action sequences, interaction metrics,
    and other relevant gameplay indicators that represent the player's current behavioral
    profile.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      BehaviorSample sample = PlayerPatternRecognition::CreateBehaviorSample(player);

      // Use sample for further analysis or storage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully in performance-sensitive contexts
    as it may involve collecting substantial behavioral data from the player. The
    behavior sample is a snapshot and will not reflect changes in player behavior
    after the sample is created.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method assumes the player object
    is in a consistent state and should not be called during critical gameplay transitions
    where player data might be partially updated or corrupted.
