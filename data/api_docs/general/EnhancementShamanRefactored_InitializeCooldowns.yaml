documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for enhancement shaman abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up internal cooldown tracking structures
    for all enhancement shaman abilities. This method is typically called during player
    initialization or when switching to the enhancement shaman specialization. It
    ensures that all relevant spells and abilities have their cooldown timers properly
    initialized, allowing the player's ability to function correctly within the game
    mechanics. The method prepares the cooldown system to accurately track spell usage
    and prevent players from casting abilities before their cooldowns expire.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'EnhancementShamanRefactored shaman;

      shaman.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    an enhancement shaman character. It is typically invoked automatically by the
    core TrinityCore systems when a player switches to the enhancement shaman specialization
    or when a new enhancement shaman character is created.
