documentation:
  brief: Initializes default AI strategies for the bot, setting up core behavioral
    patterns and decision-making logic.
  description: The InitializeDefaultStrategies method configures the default artificial
    intelligence behaviors for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method establishes the foundational strategy set that governs how the bot will
    act in various game scenarios, including combat, movement, and interaction with
    environment elements. It typically sets up core decision-making modules such as
    threat assessment, target selection, and action prioritization. The initialization
    process ensures that the bot has a coherent baseline behavior before any custom
    strategies are applied or modified. This method should generally be called during
    bot creation or activation to ensure proper AI functionality.

  - title: Basic Bot AI Initialization
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();

      botAI->InitializeDefaultStrategies();

      // Bot is now ready with default AI behaviors'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically executes during the bot's initialization phase and
    should not be called repeatedly unless resetting the AI state. The implementation
    may involve loading predefined strategy configurations from internal data structures
    or configuration files.
