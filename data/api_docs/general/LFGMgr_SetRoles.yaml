  class: LFGMgr
  method: SetRoles
  signature: void LFGMgr::SetRoles(int guid, uint8 roles)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the roles for a player in the LFG system
  description: The SetRoles method assigns specific role permissions to a player within
    the Looking for Group (LFG) system. This function is used to define what roles
    a player can take on when joining groups, such as tank, healer, or damage dealer.
    The method updates the internal state of the LFG manager to reflect the new role
    configuration for the specified player GUID. This is typically called during player
    login, role changes, or when updating group compositions.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose roles are being
      set. This should be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore system.
  - name: roles
    description: A bitmask value representing the roles assigned to the player. Common
      role flags include LFG_ROLE_TANK, LFG_ROLE_HEALER, and LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE. Multiple
      roles can be combined using bitwise OR operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a player as both tank and healer
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->SetRoles(playerGUID, LFG_ROLE_TANK | LFG_ROLE_HEALER);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a player as damage dealer only
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->SetRoles(playerGUID, LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal LFG state for the specified player.
    It should be called with appropriate synchronization if used in a multi-threaded
    environment. The roles parameter is expected to be a valid bitmask that aligns
    with the LFG role definitions defined in the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting role flags can lead to unexpected behavior in group
    matching and queue systems. Ensure that the role values passed are valid LFG_ROLE_*
    constants from the TrinityCore API. Avoid calling this method with invalid GUIDs
    as it may cause undefined behavior.
