  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::OptimizeEventComposition(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the composition of a guild event by adjusting participant roles
    and assignments.
  description: The OptimizeEventComposition method recalculates and reassigns guild
    members to appropriate roles within a specified guild event, ensuring optimal
    participation and performance. This method is typically invoked when event conditions
    change or when new participants join, allowing the system to dynamically balance
    the event's composition for maximum efficiency. The optimization process may involve
    redistributing roles such as tanks, healers, and damage dealers based on member
    availability, skill levels, and current event requirements. It ensures that all
    event slots are filled appropriately and that no critical roles remain unfilled.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.OptimizeEventComposition(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called during active guild events to maintain
    optimal composition. It may trigger internal event notifications and updates to
    participant assignments. Performance impact is minimal but depends on the number
    of participants in the event.
  warnings: Ensure that eventId corresponds to an existing active guild event; calling
    this method with invalid or inactive event IDs may result in undefined behavior
    or failed optimizations.
