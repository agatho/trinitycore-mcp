  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: SelectBotForZone
  signature: int BotSpawnerOptimized::SelectBotForZone(uint32 zoneId, uint32 level)
documentation:
  brief: Selects an appropriate bot for a specified zone and level.
  description: The SelectBotForZone method determines and returns the identifier of
    a suitable bot to spawn within a given zone at a specific player level. This method
    is typically used in automated bot management systems to ensure that bots are
    appropriately matched to the player's current zone and level for balanced gameplay
    or testing purposes. It may consider factors such as zone difficulty, bot availability,
    and level restrictions. The method assumes that the bot system has been initialized
    and that valid zone and level parameters have been provided.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone where the bot should be spawned.
      Must correspond to a valid zone in the game world.
  - name: level
    description: The level of the player for whom the bot is being selected. Determines
      the appropriate bot level and capabilities.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID (Global Unique Identifier) of
    the selected bot. If no suitable bot can be found, it returns -1 to indicate failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int botGuid = botSpawner.SelectBotForZone(1234, 60);\nif (botGuid != -1)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with spawning the bot using botGuid\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "int botGuid = botSpawner.SelectBotForZone(5678, 40);\nif (botGuid == -1)\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where no suitable bot is available\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      No bot found for zone 5678 at level 40\");\n} else {\n    // Spawn the selected\
      \ bot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform internal lookups or checks to ensure that the returned
    bot is compatible with both the specified zone and player level. It's recommended
    to validate inputs before calling this method for optimal performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the zoneId and level parameters are valid; invalid values
    might lead to unexpected behavior or failure to select a bot.
