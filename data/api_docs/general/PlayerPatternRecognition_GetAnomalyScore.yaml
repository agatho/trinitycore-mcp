  method: GetAnomalyScore
  signature: float PlayerPatternRecognition::GetAnomalyScore(Player * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns an anomaly score for the specified player based on
    pattern recognition analysis.
  description: The GetAnomalyScore method evaluates various behavioral patterns and
    data points associated with a given player to determine how anomalous their activity
    is compared to normal gameplay behavior. This score is typically used in anti-cheat
    systems or for detecting unusual player actions that may indicate cheating, automation,
    or other forms of exploitation. The method performs internal analysis using player-specific
    data such as movement patterns, action frequency, interaction timing, and other
    behavioral metrics. It returns a floating-point value where higher scores generally
    indicate more suspicious or anomalous behavior. The calculation is based on heuristics
    and machine learning models implemented within the PlayerPatternRecognition class.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the anomaly score for the player. Higher values
    indicate more anomalous behavior; typically ranges from 0.0 (normal) to potentially
    several hundred or more depending on detected irregularities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check a player's anomaly score
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer\n\
      float score = patternRecognition->GetAnomalyScore(targetPlayer);\nif (score\
      \ > 10.0f) {\n    // Player behavior is flagged as potentially suspicious\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"High anomaly score detected: %f\", score);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves computationally intensive pattern matching and
    should be used judiciously in performance-critical code paths. The exact algorithmic
    implementation details are not publicly exposed but are part of TrinityCore's
    internal anti-cheat infrastructure.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null player pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Always validate the player pointer before calling this method.
    Additionally, false positives can occur due to legitimate but unusual player behaviors,
    so scores should not be used as sole indicators of cheating without further investigation.
