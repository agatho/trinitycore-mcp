documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SmartScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The SmartScript destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all memory and resources allocated during the lifetime of a SmartScript object.
    This includes releasing references to AI events, clearing internal data structures,
    and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, SmartScript objects are typically used to manage AI behaviors
    for creatures and game objects through scripted event handling. The destructor
    ensures that when an AI script is removed or replaced, all associated memory is
    freed and no memory leaks occur. This method should never be called manually unless
    explicitly required by the object lifecycle management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SmartScript
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SmartScript* script = new SmartScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Triggers ~SmartScript\
      \ destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a SmartScript object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this destructor
    does not directly interact with the game world state but rather manages internal
    memory and references. Developers should ensure proper object lifecycle management
    to prevent memory leaks.
  warnings: Never manually invoke the destructor unless implementing custom memory
    management. The destructor assumes all internal data structures are valid and
    properly initialized, so calling it on an uninitialized or corrupted SmartScript
    instance may lead to undefined behavior.
