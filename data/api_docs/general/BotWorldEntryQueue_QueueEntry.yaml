    entry)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a bot world entry to the queue and returns its unique identifier.
  description: The QueueEntry method inserts a BotWorldEntry into the internal queue
    structure managed by the BotWorldEntryQueue class. It assigns a unique sequential
    identifier to the queued entry and returns this identifier for tracking purposes.
    This method is typically used in bot management systems where entries need to
    be processed in a first-in-first-out manner, with each entry receiving a distinct
    ID for reference. The method ensures thread safety when multiple threads attempt
    to queue entries simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 identifier representing the position or index of the queued
    entry within the internal queue structure. This identifier can be used later to
    reference or retrieve the specific entry from the queue.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotWorldEntry> entry = std::make_shared<BotWorldEntry>();

      uint32 queueId = queue.QueueEntry(entry);

      // queueId now contains the unique identifier for the queued entry'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Queued Entries
    code: "std::shared_ptr<BotWorldEntry> entry = std::make_shared<BotWorldEntry>();\n\
      uint32 id = queue.QueueEntry(entry);\n// Later, use id to access or process\
      \ the entry\nif (auto queuedEntry = queue.GetEntryById(id)) {\n    // Process\
      \ the queued entry\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that BotWorldEntry objects are properly initialized before
    being queued. The returned identifier is guaranteed to be unique within the scope
    of this queue instance but may not be persistent across different queue instances
    or sessions.
  warnings: Calling QueueEntry with a null shared_ptr will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that all entries passed to this method are valid and properly constructed
    before queuing them.
