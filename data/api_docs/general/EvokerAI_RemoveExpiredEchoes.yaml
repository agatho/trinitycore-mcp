  method: RemoveExpiredEchoes
  signature: void EvokerAI::RemoveExpiredEchoes()
documentation:
  brief: Removes expired echo effects from the evoker's aura list.
  description: The RemoveExpiredEchoes method iterates through the evoker's active
    auras and removes any echo effects that have exceeded their duration. This method
    is typically called during the AI update cycle to maintain the integrity of the
    evoker's spell effects. Echo effects are temporary buffs that provide additional
    damage or healing, and they expire after a set time period. The method ensures
    that expired echoes do not continue to influence the evoker's behavior or combat
    effectiveness.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    RemoveExpiredEchoes();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the AI update cycle to prevent concurrent
    modification of the aura list. The method does not directly interact with the
    game state beyond removing expired auras, so it's safe to call from within other
    AI methods.
