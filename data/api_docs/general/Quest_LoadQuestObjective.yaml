  brief: Loads quest objective data from database fields for a given quest.
  description: This method initializes the quest objective information by reading
    data from the database fields and populating internal structures. It handles the
    parsing and assignment of quest objectives, including rewards, requirements, and
    progress tracking. The method ensures that all quest-related data is properly
    loaded and validated before being used in game mechanics. This is typically called
    during quest initialization or when loading quest data from the database.

  notes: This method is part of the internal quest loading mechanism and should not
    be called directly by external code. It's typically invoked during quest initialization
    process when database data is being parsed.
  warnings: Improper usage can lead to corrupted quest data or missing objectives.
    This method requires proper field array validation before execution.
