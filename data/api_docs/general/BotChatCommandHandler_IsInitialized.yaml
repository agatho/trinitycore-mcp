  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: IsInitialized
  signature: bool BotChatCommandHandler::IsInitialized()
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot chat command handler has been properly initialized
    and is ready for use.
  description: The IsInitialized method determines if the BotChatCommandHandler instance
    has completed its initialization process. This method typically checks internal
    flags or state variables that indicate whether all required setup operations have
    been performed, such as loading configuration data, registering commands, or establishing
    necessary connections. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this ensures
    that chat command handling functionality is fully operational before attempting
    to process incoming messages. The method returns false if initialization has not
    yet occurred or if a previous initialization attempt failed, and true only when
    all prerequisites are met.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotChatCommandHandler is fully initialized and ready
    for use; otherwise returns false if initialization has not completed or encountered
    an error.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "if (botChatHandler.IsInitialized()) {\n    // Safe to process chat commands\n\
      \    botChatHandler.HandleCommand(\"hello\");\n} else {\n    // Initialization\
      \ pending or failed\n    sLog->outError(\"Bot chat handler not initialized\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot system before allowing
    command processing. It may perform lightweight checks such as verifying internal
    state flags rather than expensive operations.
