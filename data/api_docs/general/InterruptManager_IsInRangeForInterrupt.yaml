  class: InterruptManager
  method: IsInRangeForInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptManager::IsInRangeForInterrupt(Unit * target, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit is within the valid range for interrupting
    spell casting.
  description: The IsInRangeForInterrupt method checks if a specified target unit
    is within the acceptable distance range to interrupt their current spell cast.
    This functionality is crucial for game mechanics involving spell interruption,
    such as when a player or creature attempts to cast a spell that can be interrupted
    by nearby enemies or environmental effects. The method evaluates both the physical
    distance between the caster and target and any relevant game-specific range limitations.
    It returns true if the target is within range, false otherwise. This check is
    typically performed before attempting an interrupt action to ensure validity of
    the operation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell casting
      range is being evaluated. Must not be null.
  - name: range
    description: Floating-point value specifying the maximum distance allowed for
      spell interruption. This represents the effective range in yards or game units.
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the target unit is within the specified
    range for spell interruption. Returns true if the target is within range, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check interrupt range
    code: "if (interruptManager->IsInRangeForInterrupt(targetUnit, 10.0f)) {\n   \
      \ // Proceed with spell interruption logic\n    targetUnit->InterruptSpell();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using interrupt range in combat decision making
    code: "float interruptRange = 8.0f;\nif (player->IsInRangeForInterrupt(enemy,\
      \ interruptRange)) {\n    // Player can attempt to interrupt enemy's spell\n\
      \    if (player->CanInterruptSpell(enemy)) {\n        player->InterruptCurrentSpell();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs distance calculations using the unit's position
    coordinates and may account for collision detection or line-of-sight restrictions
    depending on game implementation. The range parameter should be validated to ensure
    it is non-negative, though the method itself might handle invalid values gracefully.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent null pointer dereferences. Be aware that spell interruption mechanics
    may also depend on other factors such as spell type, caster state, or player abilities
    beyond just distance.
