documentation:
  brief: Returns the type of totem associated with this Totem object.
  description: The GetTotemType method retrieves the specific type of totem that this
    Totem instance represents. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    totems are summoned objects that persist for a duration and provide various effects
    based on their type. This method allows scripts and game logic to determine what
    kind of totem is active, which can be crucial for managing totem behavior, interactions,
    or cooldowns. The returned TotemType enum value indicates whether the totem is
    a Fire, Water, Earth, or Air totem, among others, depending on the spell that
    summoned it.
  parameters: []
  returns: A TotemType enumeration value indicating the specific type of totem. Possible
    values include TOTEM_TYPE_FIRE, TOTEM_TYPE_WATER, TOTEM_TYPE_EARTH, TOTEM_TYPE_AIR,
    and potentially others depending on game updates or expansions.
  examples:
  - title: Check Totem Type for Behavior Logic
    code: "if (totem->GetTotemType() == TOTEM_TYPE_FIRE)\n{\n    // Apply fire-based\
      \ effects or logic\n    // e.g., increase damage dealt by nearby allies\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine Totem Type for Cooldown Management
    code: "TotemType type = totem->GetTotemType();\nswitch (type)\n{\n    case TOTEM_TYPE_FIRE:\n\
      \        // Handle fire totem cooldown\n        break;\n    case TOTEM_TYPE_WATER:\n\
      \        // Handle water totem cooldown\n        break;\n    default:\n    \
      \    // Default behavior for other totem types\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with totem summoning spells
    and their associated effects. The returned TotemType value directly corresponds
    to the spell effect that created the totem, so it's important for developers to
    ensure they're handling all possible types appropriately when writing logic that
    depends on totem type.
  warnings: Ensure that you are not calling this method on a null or invalid Totem
    pointer. While the method is marked as const, it should only be called on valid
    totem instances that have been properly initialized and summoned by a player or
    spell effect.
