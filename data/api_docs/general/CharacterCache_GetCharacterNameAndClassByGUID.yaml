  signature: bool CharacterCache::GetCharacterNameAndClassByGUID(int guid, std::string
    & name, uint8 & _class) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name and class of a character by their GUID from the character
    cache.
  description: The GetCharacterNameAndClassByGUID method fetches the stored name and
    class information for a character identified by a given GUID from the internal
    character cache. This method is typically used to quickly retrieve basic character
    data without performing expensive database queries. It returns true if the character
    data was successfully found in the cache, and false otherwise. The method assumes
    that the character data has already been loaded into the cache, usually through
    prior calls to CharacterCache::LoadCharacterData or similar loading mechanisms.
    This is a read-only operation that does not modify any data.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character to look up. Must be
      a valid, non-zero GUID that exists in the cache.
  - name: name
    description: Reference to a std::string where the character's name will be stored
      upon successful lookup.
  - name: _class
    description: Reference to a uint8 variable where the character's class ID will
      be stored upon successful lookup.
  returns: True if the character data was found in the cache and the name and class
    were successfully retrieved; false if the GUID does not exist in the cache or
    if there was an error during retrieval.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int guid = 12345;\nstd::string name;\nuint8 _class;\n\nif (CharacterCache::GetCharacterNameAndClassByGUID(guid,\
      \ name, _class)) {\n    std::cout << \"Character Name: \" << name << \", Class:\
      \ \" << static_cast<int>(_class) << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"\
      Character not found in cache.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on cached data only, so it will only return results
    for characters that have been previously loaded into the cache. The cache must
    be properly initialized and populated before calling this method. Performance
    is optimized as it avoids database access, but requires that the character data
    exists in memory.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided is valid and corresponds to an existing
    character in the cache. Calling this method with a non-existent GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect data being returned if the cache contains stale
    entries. This method should not be used for real-time character creation or modification
    operations.
