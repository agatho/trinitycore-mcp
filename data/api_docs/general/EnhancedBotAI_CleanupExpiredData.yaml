  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::CleanupExpiredData()
documentation:
  brief: Removes expired or outdated data entries from the bot's internal tracking
    systems
  description: The CleanupExpiredData method is responsible for maintaining the integrity
    and performance of the EnhancedBotAI system by removing stale data entries that
    have exceeded their valid lifespan. This includes cleaning up expired quest tracking
    information, abandoned loot caches, and other temporary data structures that are
    no longer relevant to the bot's current state. The method ensures that the AI
    does not operate on outdated information that could lead to incorrect behavior
    or resource waste. It typically runs periodically as part of the bot's maintenance
    routines to keep memory usage optimal and prevent logical errors caused by stale
    data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Update Loop
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    CleanupExpiredData();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Cleanup Trigger
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    // Perform cleanup\
      \ when bot logs in\n    CleanupExpiredData();\n    // ... rest of login logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to maintain optimal performance. It
    is typically invoked during periodic AI updates or when significant state changes
    occur. The cleanup process may involve database operations and should not be called
    too frequently to avoid performance degradation.
  warnings: Calling this method during critical AI decision-making processes might
    cause unexpected behavior if the method removes data that is currently being referenced.
    Ensure proper synchronization if the method is called from multiple threads.
