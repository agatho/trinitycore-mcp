documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bounding box dimensions of the game object model.
  description: The getBounds method returns a reference to an integer array containing
    the bounding box coordinates of the GameObjectModel. This method provides access
    to the model's spatial boundaries which are used for collision detection, rendering
    culling, and other spatial operations within the TrinityCore engine. The returned
    bounds typically represent the minimum and maximum X, Y, and Z coordinates that
    define the object's volume in 3D space. This information is crucial for determining
    whether the game object intersects with other objects or boundaries during gameplay
    mechanics such as line-of-sight checks, movement validation, and object placement.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A const reference to an integer array representing the bounding box coordinates
    of the GameObjectModel. The array typically contains six values: [minX, maxX,
    minY, maxY, minZ, maxZ] defining the 3D boundaries of the model in world space.'
  examples:
  - title: Accessing GameObjectModel bounds for collision detection
    code: 'GameObjectModel* model = ...; // Assume model is initialized

      const int& bounds = model->getBounds();

      int minX = bounds[0];

      int maxX = bounds[1];

      int minY = bounds[2];

      int maxY = bounds[3];

      int minZ = bounds[4];

      int maxZ = bounds[5];

      // Use bounds for collision checks or spatial queries'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned integer values represent coordinates in the game world's coordinate
    system. These values are typically scaled to match TrinityCore's internal coordinate
    precision, which may differ from standard floating-point representations. The
    method is designed to be efficient and should not perform expensive calculations
    at runtime.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying the returned reference as it points directly
    to internal model data. Changes to this array will affect the model's bounding
    box representation. Ensure that any access to the bounds is thread-safe if used
    in multi-threaded contexts.
