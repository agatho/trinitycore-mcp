  class: InstanceMapScript
  method: InstanceMapScript
  signature: void InstanceMapScript::InstanceMapScript(const char * name, uint32 mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an InstanceMapScript with a name and map ID for use in TrinityCore's
    instance management system.
  description: The InstanceMapScript constructor initializes a script object that
    handles instance-specific logic for a given map. This method sets up the internal
    state of the script, associating it with a specific map ID and providing a unique
    name identifier. The script will be used by the TrinityCore server to manage instance-related
    events, such as player entry, instance creation, and cleanup. It is typically
    called during server initialization or when registering new instance scripts with
    the game engine. This constructor does not perform any runtime operations but
    prepares the script for integration into the instance management system.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that uniquely identifies this instance script.
      This name is used internally by TrinityCore to reference and manage the script.
      It should be unique across all registered scripts.
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map this script will handle. This ID
      corresponds to a specific dungeon, raid, or instance in the game world. Valid
      values are defined in the game's map database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic InstanceMapScript Initialization
    code: "class ExampleInstanceScript : public InstanceMapScript\n{\npublic:\n  \
      \  ExampleInstanceScript() : InstanceMapScript(\"example_instance\", 1234) {}\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called within the context of a class that inherits
    from InstanceMapScript. The map ID provided must correspond to an actual map in
    the TrinityCore database, otherwise the script will not be properly registered.
    The name parameter should be unique and descriptive to avoid conflicts with other
    scripts.
