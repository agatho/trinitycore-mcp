  signature: uint32 BrewmasterStaggerTracker::GetStaggerAmount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stagger amount of a Brewmaster monk.
  description: The GetStaggerAmount method returns the total amount of stagger damage
    currently applied to the Brewmaster monk. Stagger is a damage mitigation mechanic
    in World of Warcraft where incoming damage is temporarily stored as a 'stagger'
    effect before being absorbed by the monk's defensive abilities. This value represents
    the accumulated stagger that has not yet been processed or absorbed by abilities
    like Detox, Purify, or the monk's natural stagger absorption mechanics. The returned
    value is typically used to determine when to apply stagger mitigation effects
    or to display visual feedback to the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current amount of stagger damage accumulated
    on the Brewmaster. This value increases as the monk takes damage and decreases
    when stagger is absorbed through abilities or natural mitigation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Stagger Status
    code: "uint32 stagger = player->GetStaggerAmount();\nif (stagger > 0)\n{\n   \
      \ // Player has stagger, can apply mitigation\n    SendStaggerVisualEffect(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Stagger Amount for Ability Logic
    code: "void BrewmasterAI::Update()\n{\n    uint32 currentStagger = m_player->GetStaggerAmount();\n\
      \    if (currentStagger >= 10000)\n    {\n        // Apply Detox or other high-priority\
      \ stagger mitigation\n        DoCast(SPELL_DETOX);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on Brewmaster monks. The returned value
    is updated in real-time as damage is applied and absorbed. The method does not
    perform any calculations itself but returns a cached value stored within the BrewmasterStaggerTracker
    class.
  warnings: Do not assume that a zero return value means no damage has been taken
    - it may indicate that all stagger has been absorbed or processed. This method
    should be used in conjunction with other stagger tracking methods to get complete
    picture of the monk's stagger state.
