  signature: void MonkAI::~MonkAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MonkAI instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~MonkAI destructor is called automatically when a MonkAI object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of any dynamically allocated memory, AI state variables, and references held by
    the MonkAI instance. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor
    is responsible for releasing resources such as behavior trees, action queues,
    and any internal data structures used to manage the monk's combat and movement
    behaviors. The destruction process typically involves calling parent class destructors
    and cleaning up any AI-specific components that may have been initialized during
    the object's lifetime.

  - title: Automatic destruction of MonkAI instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    MonkAI* ai = new MonkAI();\n    // ... use\
      \ ai ...\n    delete ai; // ~MonkAI() is called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack allocation with automatic destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    MonkAI ai; // Constructor called\n    //\
      \ ... use ai ...\n    // ~MonkAI() called automatically when ai goes out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that all derived classes properly call
    their parent destructors to maintain proper object cleanup order. The destruction
    process may involve multiple levels of inheritance, so developers should verify
    that all base class destructors are virtual if needed.
