  brief: Destroys an AsyncBotInitializer instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AsyncBotInitializer class is responsible for
    releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance.
    In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this method ensures proper cleanup
    of asynchronous initialization components that may have been set up during the
    object's lifetime. It is automatically invoked when an AsyncBotInitializer object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer* initializer = new AsyncBotInitializer();

      // ... perform initialization tasks ...

      delete initializer; // Destructor is called here automatically'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only on objects that were allocated on the
    heap using 'new'. If an object was created on the stack, its destructor will be
    invoked automatically upon leaving scope. Ensure no other threads are accessing
    the object during destruction to avoid race conditions.
