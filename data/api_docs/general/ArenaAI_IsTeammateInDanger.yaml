  class: ArenaAI
  method: IsTeammateInDanger
  signature: bool ArenaAI::IsTeammateInDanger(int * teammate) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if any teammate in the arena is currently in danger and returns the
    index of the first such teammate.
  description: The IsTeammateInDanger method evaluates the current state of all teammates
    within an arena environment to determine whether any of them are under threat
    or in a vulnerable condition. This method is typically used by AI logic to make
    decisions about when to provide assistance, reposition, or engage enemies. It
    iterates through the team members and assesses their health, positioning, and
    proximity to enemy threats. The method returns true if at least one teammate is
    considered to be in danger, and optionally sets the provided pointer to the index
    of that teammate. This allows for targeted intervention by the AI system. The
    exact criteria for determining 'danger' may vary based on game mechanics such
    as low health thresholds, proximity to enemy players, or being engaged in combat.
  parameters:
  - name: teammate
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be set to the index of the first
      teammate found in danger. If no teammate is in danger, the value remains unchanged.
      This parameter can be null if the caller does not need the specific index.
  returns: Returns true if at least one teammate is in danger; otherwise returns false.
    When a teammate is in danger and the 'teammate' parameter is not null, the method
    sets the value pointed to by 'teammate' to the index of that teammate.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if any teammate is in danger
    code: "int teammateIndex;\nif (arenaAI.IsTeammateInDanger(&teammateIndex)) {\n\
      \    // A teammate is in danger, handle accordingly\n    printf(\"Teammate at\
      \ index %d is in danger\\n\", teammateIndex);\n} else {\n    // No teammates\
      \ are currently in danger\n    printf(\"No teammates in danger\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the method without retrieving the teammate index
    code: "if (arenaAI.IsTeammateInDanger(nullptr)) {\n    // At least one teammate\
      \ is in danger, take action\n    arenaAI.DefendTeammate();\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Continue with normal behavior\n    arenaAI.MoveToSafePosition();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ArenaAI class and is designed specifically for
    use in battlegrounds or arenas where team-based combat occurs. It assumes that
    the AI has access to information about all teammates, including their health status
    and positioning. The implementation may rely on internal data structures such
    as a list or array of teammate references or indices. Performance-wise, this method
    should be efficient since it typically involves simple checks rather than complex
    computations.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'teammate' parameter is not null if you intend to retrieve
    the index of the teammate in danger. If it's null and you're not using the index,
    the method will still function correctly but won't provide positional information.
    Be cautious when calling this method frequently during combat as it may impact
    performance if not optimized.
