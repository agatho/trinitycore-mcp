documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the primary role of a player based on their class
    and specialization.
  description: The GetPrimaryRole method evaluates the provided class and specialization
    identifiers to determine the most appropriate group role for that player. This
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft's group dynamics, such as determining tank,
    healer, or damage dealer roles within a raid or party. The method uses internal
    mappings defined by the TrinityCore framework to associate class and spec combinations
    with their respective roles. It does not require any parameters beyond the class
    and specialization identifiers, which are typically obtained from player data
    structures. This function is essential for role-based group management, loot distribution,
    and encounter strategy implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a GroupRole enum value indicating the primary role of the specified
    class and specialization combination. Possible values may include GROUP_ROLE_TANK,
    GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE, or GROUP_ROLE_NONE if no specific role is
    assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Determine Primary Role for a Warrior
    code: 'GroupRole role = RoleDefinitions::GetPrimaryRole(CLASS_WARRIOR, SPEC_WARRIOR_ARMS);

      // Returns GROUP_ROLE_TANK or similar based on spec mapping'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Role for a Mage Player
    code: 'GroupRole role = RoleDefinitions::GetPrimaryRole(CLASS_MAGE, SPEC_MAGE_FROST);

      // Returns GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE typically for frost mages'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal class and spec to role mappings that are defined
    within the TrinityCore codebase. The implementation assumes valid classId and
    specId values, as invalid inputs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    role assignments. It is recommended to validate these parameters before calling
    this function in production code.
  warnings: This method does not perform parameter validation internally. Passing
    invalid classId or specId values can lead to unexpected results or crashes. Always
    ensure that the provided identifiers correspond to valid class and specialization
    combinations as defined by the game's constants.
