  method: ~PerformanceProfile
  signature: void PerformanceProfile::~PerformanceProfile()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PerformanceProfile instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~PerformanceProfile destructor is automatically invoked when a
    PerformanceProfile object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method
    ensures proper cleanup of any internal data structures, timers, or profiling metrics
    that were allocated during the object's lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's
    performance monitoring system, this destructor plays a crucial role in preventing
    memory leaks and maintaining accurate profiling data. The destruction process
    typically involves releasing memory used for tracking performance statistics,
    stopping any active profiling sessions, and ensuring thread-safe cleanup if the
    profile was being actively monitored.

  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    PerformanceProfile profile;\n    // ... perform\
      \ profiling operations ...\n    // profile is automatically destroyed here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion Pattern
    code: 'PerformanceProfile* profile = new PerformanceProfile();

      // ... use profile ...

      delete profile; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects go out
    of scope. For dynamically allocated PerformanceProfile objects, explicit deletion
    is required to trigger the destructor. The implementation should be thread-safe
    if multiple threads might access the same profile object simultaneously.
  warnings: Attempting to use a PerformanceProfile object after its destructor has
    been called results in undefined behavior. Ensure all references to the object
    are cleared before destruction.
