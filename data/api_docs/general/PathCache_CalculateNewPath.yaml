  class: PathCache
  method: CalculateNewPath
  signature: PathResult PathCache::CalculateNewPath(const int & src, const int & dest,
    const int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a new path between two points in the navigation mesh for use in
    movement and AI behavior.
  description: The CalculateNewPath method computes a navigable route from a source
    point to a destination point within the game's navigation mesh. This method is
    typically used by AI systems, movement controllers, or pathfinding logic to determine
    valid movement paths for units. The method may utilize cached path data if available,
    or compute a new path if no suitable cache exists. It returns a PathResult indicating
    success or failure of the path calculation and provides the resulting path data
    for subsequent use in movement execution. The owner parameter can be used to associate
    the calculated path with a specific entity for caching or tracking purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: src
    description: The starting point identifier (typically a node index or position
      reference) from which the path calculation begins.
  - name: dest
    description: The destination point identifier (typically a node index or position
      reference) to which the path calculation is directed.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an entity that owns or requested this path. Used for caching
      and tracking purposes; can be null if no owner is specified.
  returns: A PathResult enum value indicating the outcome of the path calculation.
    Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, or other status codes depending on implementation
    details. The result typically includes path data that can be used for movement
    execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic path calculation between two nodes
    code: "PathResult result = pathCache.CalculateNewPath(100, 200, nullptr);\nif\
      \ (result == PathResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Proceed with movement using the\
      \ calculated path\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Path calculation with owner tracking
    code: "Unit* player = ...;\nPathResult result = pathCache.CalculateNewPath(100,\
      \ 200, &player);\nif (result == PathResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Path is now associated\
      \ with the player for caching\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform expensive computations if no cached path exists.
    It's recommended to cache results where possible and reuse paths when appropriate.
    The implementation likely uses A* or similar algorithms internally for pathfinding
    within the navigation mesh.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid source or destination identifiers can
    lead to undefined behavior or failed path calculations. Always validate input
    parameters before calling this method, especially in performance-critical code
    paths.
