  signature: const char * DB2Manager::GetChrClassName(uint8 class_, LocaleConstant
    locale)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the localized class name for a given class ID and locale.
  description: The GetChrClassName method retrieves the localized name of a character
    class based on the provided class identifier and locale constant. This function
    is typically used to display user-friendly class names in the game interface,
    such as in character creation screens, player lists, or tooltips. The method accesses
    internal DB2 data structures that contain localized string entries for class names.
    It's important to note that this method may return a default or fallback string
    if the requested locale does not contain the specific class name entry. The returned
    pointer points to an internal static buffer and should not be modified or freed
    by the caller.
  parameters:
  - name: class_
    description: The character class identifier (0-11) representing different player
      classes in World of Warcraft such as Warrior, Paladin, Hunter, etc.
  - name: locale
    description: The LocaleConstant enum value specifying the desired language for
      localization. Valid values include LOCALE_enUS, LOCALE_koKR, LOCALE_frFR, LOCALE_deDE,
      LOCALE_zhCN, LOCALE_twCN, LOCALE_esES, LOCALE_esMX, LOCALE_ruRU.
  returns: A const char* pointer to the localized class name string. Returns NULL
    if the class ID is invalid or no localized entry exists for the specified locale.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get English class name
    code: "const char* className = sDB2Manager->GetChrClassName(1, LOCALE_enUS); //\
      \ Returns \"Paladin\" for class ID 1\nif (className)\n{\n    printf(\"Class\
      \ name: %s\\n\", className);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with different locales
    code: "uint8 playerClass = 3; // Hunter\nconst char* frenchName = sDB2Manager->GetChrClassName(playerClass,\
      \ LOCALE_frFR); // Returns \"Chasseur\"\nconst char* germanName = sDB2Manager->GetChrClassName(playerClass,\
      \ LOCALE_deDE); // Returns \"J\xE4ger\"\nprintf(\"French: %s, German: %s\\n\"\
      , frenchName ? frenchName : \"Not found\", germanName ? germanName : \"Not found\"\
      );"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses cached DB2 data and is optimized for frequent calls.
    The returned string is stored in an internal static buffer, so it's not thread-safe
    for modification but safe for reading. Performance is generally fast due to caching
    mechanisms within the DB2Manager class.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or free the returned string pointer as it points
    to internal memory managed by the DB2Manager. Ensure that the class ID parameter
    is within valid range (0-11) to avoid undefined behavior. If locale is invalid,
    the method may return NULL or a default value.
