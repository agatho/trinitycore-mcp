documentation:
  brief: Processes queued group coordination commands for handling player actions
    and synchronization.
  description: The ProcessCommandQueue method iterates through a queue of pending
    commands related to group coordination, such as player movement, positioning updates,
    or synchronization events. This method is typically invoked during game loop ticks
    to ensure that all queued group-related operations are executed in a timely manner.
    It handles command prioritization and execution order to maintain consistency
    across group members in dynamic environments like dungeons or raids. The method
    ensures that commands are processed without blocking the main thread and maintains
    synchronization between client and server states for group activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    groupCoordination->ProcessCommandQueue();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other operations ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called regularly during the game loop to prevent
    command queue buildup. It's optimized for performance and should not block execution
    for extended periods. The implementation uses thread-safe queue operations to
    handle concurrent access from different threads.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently may cause unnecessary overhead. Ensure
    it's only invoked at appropriate intervals (e.g., during game tick processing)
    rather than on every frame update.
