  class: PathfindingManager
  method: IsNodeWalkable
  signature: bool PathfindingManager::IsNodeWalkable(const int & pos, const PathRequest
    & request)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified node in the pathfinding grid is walkable for
    the given request.
  description: The IsNodeWalkable method checks if a particular node (identified by
    its position) within the pathfinding system is traversable based on the provided
    path request parameters. This method evaluates various factors such as terrain
    type, object collisions, and movement restrictions to determine if an NPC or player
    can legally move through that specific grid cell. It is typically used internally
    by the pathfinding engine during route calculation to ensure generated paths are
    valid and executable within the game world's constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The integer identifier representing the node position in the pathfinding
      grid. This value corresponds to a specific coordinate or index within the navigation
      mesh.
  - name: request
    description: A reference to a PathRequest object containing the context and parameters
      for the pathfinding operation, including start/end positions, movement types,
      and other relevant constraints that affect walkability checks.
  returns: Returns true if the node at the specified position is walkable according
    to the request's criteria; otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates
    that the node is either blocked, unreachable, or violates movement restrictions
    defined in the path request.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Walkability Check
    code: "PathRequest request;\nrequest.start = {100, 200, 300};\nrequest.end = {400,\
      \ 500, 600};\nint nodePos = 12345;\nbool isWalkable = pathfindingManager.IsNodeWalkable(nodePos,\
      \ request);\nif (isWalkable) {\n    // Proceed with path traversal\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Pathfinding Logic
    code: "class MyAI {\n    bool IsValidPath(const std::vector<int>& nodes, const\
      \ PathRequest& request) {\n        for (int node : nodes) {\n            if\
      \ (!pathfindingManager.IsNodeWalkable(node, request)) {\n                return\
      \ false;\n            }\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal pathfinding system and should not be
    called directly by external modules unless implementing custom pathfinding logic.
    The performance of this function depends on the complexity of the path request
    and the current state of the navigation mesh.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid node positions or malformed path requests
    may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all input parameters are validated
    before invoking this method in production code.
