  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: GetAdapterStats
  signature: const AdapterStats & BotSpawnerAdapter::GetAdapterStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the statistical data structure containing adapter performance and
    operational metrics.
  description: The GetAdapterStats method returns a constant reference to an AdapterStats
    object that holds comprehensive statistics about the BotSpawnerAdapter's current
    state and performance. This includes information such as the number of bots spawned,
    active connections, processing times, and other relevant operational data. The
    returned structure is read-only to prevent external modification of internal adapter
    metrics. This method is typically used for monitoring, debugging, or reporting
    purposes within the TrinityCore framework's bot management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an AdapterStats object containing detailed statistics
    about the BotSpawnerAdapter's operational state and performance metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Monitoring
    code: 'const AdapterStats& stats = botSpawnerAdapter.GetAdapterStats();

      std::cout << "Bots spawned: " << stats.botsSpawned << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Active connections: " << stats.activeConnections << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned AdapterStats reference is valid only as long as the BotSpawnerAdapter
    instance exists. Accessing the statistics after the adapter has been destroyed
    results in undefined behavior. The method is thread-safe and can be called from
    multiple threads concurrently without synchronization.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned AdapterStats object through the returned reference,
    as it's const. Modifications to this structure would corrupt internal state. Also,
    ensure that the BotSpawnerAdapter instance remains valid while using the returned
    reference.
