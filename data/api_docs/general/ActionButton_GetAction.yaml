  method: GetAction
  signature: uint64 ActionButton::GetAction() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the action identifier stored in the action button.
  description: The GetAction method returns the 64-bit unsigned integer value representing
    the action associated with this action button. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, action buttons typically store information about spells, items, or
    other game actions that can be bound to a user interface element. This identifier
    is used internally by the game engine to determine what action should be executed
    when the button is pressed. The returned value may represent a spell ID, item
    entry, macro index, or another type of action identifier depending on how the
    button was initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the action identifier stored in the button.
    This could be a spell ID, item entry, macro index, or other game action identifier
    depending on the button's configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use action from an action button
    code: "ActionButton* button = player->GetActionButton(1);\nuint64 actionId = button->GetAction();\n\
      if (actionId > 0)\n{\n    // Use the action ID to determine what action to perform\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Button contains action: %llu\", actionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that does not modify any internal state. It's
    commonly used in conjunction with player action button management systems to retrieve
    stored action data for processing or display purposes.
