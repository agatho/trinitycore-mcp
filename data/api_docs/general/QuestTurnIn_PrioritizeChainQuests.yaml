  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: PrioritizeChainQuests
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::PrioritizeChainQuests(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes chain quests for the specified player bot based on quest completion
    progress and dependencies.
  description: The PrioritizeChainQuests method organizes and ranks a player bot's
    available chain quests according to their progression requirements and dependencies.
    This ensures that the bot focuses on completing prerequisite quests before advancing
    to subsequent ones in a quest chain. The method evaluates each quest's dependencies,
    checks if prerequisites are met, and reorders the quest list to optimize the bot's
    quest completion sequence. It is typically used within AI decision-making logic
    to determine which quests should be pursued first based on logical flow rather
    than arbitrary ordering.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which chain
      quests will be prioritized. Must not be null.
  returns: None. The method modifies the internal quest list of the player bot directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateQuests()\n{\n    if (Player* bot = GetBot())\n    {\n\
      \        QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;\n        questTurnIn.PrioritizeChainQuests(bot);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's quest log and may modify the
    order of quests in the bot's active quest list. It should be called periodically
    during AI updates to maintain optimal quest progression ordering.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
