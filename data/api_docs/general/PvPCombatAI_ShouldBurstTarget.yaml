  method: ShouldBurstTarget
  signature: bool PvPCombatAI::ShouldBurstTarget(int * player, int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should initiate a burst attack on the current target.
  description: The ShouldBurstTarget method evaluates the current combat state and
    target conditions to decide if a burst attack should be executed. This method
    is typically used in PvP scenarios where timing and situational awareness are
    crucial for optimal damage output or survival. It considers factors such as target
    health, distance, available resources, and combat mechanics specific to player-versus-player
    encounters. The method returns true when the AI determines that bursting the target
    will provide a tactical advantage, otherwise false.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should initiate a burst attack on the current target;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat logic
    code: "if (pvpAI->ShouldBurstTarget()) {\n    // Execute burst ability\n    unit->CastSpell(target,\
      \ BURST_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI class and relies on internal AI state
    tracking. It should only be called during active combat situations where a target
    is present. The decision-making process involves evaluating multiple combat parameters
    to determine optimal burst timing.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat or without a valid target, as
    it may return unexpected results. The method assumes that the AI has already established
    a valid combat context and target state.
