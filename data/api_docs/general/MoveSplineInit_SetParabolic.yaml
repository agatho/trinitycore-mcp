  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: SetParabolic
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetParabolic(float amplitude, float start_time)
documentation:
  brief: Configures the spline to follow a parabolic trajectory with specified amplitude
    and start time.
  description: The SetParabolic method initializes a parabolic movement path for an
    object's spline animation. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft for effects
    like jumping, flying, or other curved motion behaviors. The amplitude parameter
    controls the height of the parabola, while the start_time determines when the
    parabolic phase begins relative to the overall spline timing. This method must
    be called before finalizing the spline initialization to take effect.
  parameters:
  - name: amplitude
    description: The maximum height deviation from the base trajectory, determining
      the curvature of the parabola. Positive values create upward curves, negative
      values create downward curves.
  - name: start_time
    description: The time offset (in seconds) from the beginning of the spline where
      the parabolic motion starts. Must be non-negative and less than the total spline
      duration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Parabolic Jump
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetParabolic(2.0f, 0.5f);

      // This creates a jump that starts at 0.5 seconds into the movement with a height
      of 2 meters'
    language: cpp
  - title: Delayed Parabolic Flight
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetParabolic(5.0f, 1.0f);

      // Creates a flight path that begins its parabolic curve after 1 second of linear
      movement, reaching a peak height of 5 meters'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal spline parameters and should only be called
    during spline initialization before calling Finalize(). The amplitude value affects
    the vertical displacement but does not change the horizontal distance traveled.
    Multiple parabolic segments can be combined with other movement types in complex
    animations.
  warnings: Calling this method after spline finalization will have no effect. The
    start_time parameter must be within valid bounds relative to the total movement
    duration, otherwise unexpected behavior may occur. Incorrect amplitude values
    may cause unrealistic or visually jarring movements.
