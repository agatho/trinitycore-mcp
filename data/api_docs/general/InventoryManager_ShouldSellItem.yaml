  signature: bool InventoryManager::ShouldSellItem(Item * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given item should be sold based on inventory management
    rules.
  description: The ShouldSellItem method evaluates whether a specific item in the
    player's inventory meets criteria for being sold. This typically occurs during
    automated inventory management processes, such as when a vendor or merchant AI
    is deciding which items to discard or sell to make room for new acquisitions.
    The decision is based on factors like item value, rarity, stackability, and current
    inventory capacity. This method does not directly perform the sale but rather
    provides a boolean indication of whether selling would be beneficial according
    to predefined logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item should be sold according to inventory management
    rules; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Inventory Management
    code: "if (inventoryManager->ShouldSellItem(item)) {\n    // Sell the item\n \
      \   player->GetSession()->SendSellItem(item);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used within automated inventory management systems
    and may be called repeatedly during periodic inventory checks. It's important
    to note that the logic for determining when an item should be sold can vary depending
    on server configuration, player class, or specific AI behavior.
