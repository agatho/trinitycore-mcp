  method: ApplyCatmullRomSmoothing
  signature: void PathOptimizer::ApplyCatmullRomSmoothing(MovementPath & path, float
    tension)
documentation:
  brief: Applies Catmull-Rom spline smoothing to a movement path to create smoother
    character motion.
  description: The ApplyCatmullRomSmoothing method modifies a given MovementPath by
    applying Catmull-Rom spline interpolation to smooth out the waypoints, resulting
    in more natural and fluid movement trajectories for NPCs or players. This technique
    is commonly used in game engines to reduce jerky movements and create visually
    pleasing motion paths. The tension parameter controls how tightly the curve follows
    the original waypoints, with higher values producing tighter curves and lower
    values creating looser, more relaxed paths. The method operates in-place on the
    provided path object and does not return any value.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: Reference to a MovementPath object containing the waypoints to be
      smoothed. This path will be modified in-place with the smoothed results.
  - name: tension
    description: Float value controlling the tightness of the Catmull-Rom spline interpolation.
      Typical values range from 0.0f (loosest) to 1.0f (tightest). Values outside
      this range may produce unexpected results.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Smoothing
    code: 'MovementPath path;

      // ... populate path with waypoints ...

      PathOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.ApplyCatmullRomSmoothing(path, 0.5f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: NPC Movement Path Smoothing
    code: "void SmoothNpcMovement(Unit* npc)\n{\n    MovementPath path;\n    // ...\
      \ generate movement path for NPC ...\n    PathOptimizer optimizer;\n    optimizer.ApplyCatmullRomSmoothing(path,\
      \ 0.7f);\n    // ... apply smoothed path to NPC movement ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the input MovementPath object directly. The Catmull-Rom
    spline algorithm requires at least four waypoints for proper smoothing; fewer
    waypoints may result in undefined behavior or no smoothing effect. Performance
    is generally good for small to medium-sized paths but can become noticeable with
    very large numbers of waypoints.
  warnings: Ensure that the input path contains valid waypoints before calling this
    method, as invalid data may cause unexpected smoothing results. The tension parameter
    should be carefully tuned based on desired visual outcome; extreme values may
    produce unnatural movement patterns.
