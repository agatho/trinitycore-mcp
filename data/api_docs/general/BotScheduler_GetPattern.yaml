  method: GetPattern
  signature: const ActivityPattern * BotScheduler::GetPattern(const std::string &
    name) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a const pointer to an ActivityPattern object by its name from the
    scheduler's pattern collection.
  description: The GetPattern method searches through the internal collection of activity
    patterns managed by the BotScheduler and returns a constant pointer to the ActivityPattern
    object that matches the specified name. This method is used to access predefined
    bot behavior patterns, which define how bots should act during different game
    situations such as combat, looting, or questing. The returned pointer is const,
    meaning the pattern data cannot be modified through this interface. If no matching
    pattern is found, the method will return a null pointer. This functionality supports
    the dynamic configuration and execution of bot behaviors within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The string identifier used to locate the specific ActivityPattern
      in the scheduler's collection. This name must exactly match the one assigned
      to the pattern during initialization or loading.
  returns: A const pointer to an ActivityPattern object if a matching pattern is found;
    otherwise, returns nullptr indicating no pattern exists with the specified name.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Use a Pattern
    code: "const ActivityPattern* pattern = scheduler.GetPattern(\"CombatRoutine\"\
      );\nif (pattern != nullptr) {\n    // Use the pattern for bot behavior\n   \
      \ pattern->Execute();\n} else {\n    // Handle missing pattern case\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      bot\", \"Could not find combat routine pattern\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Pattern Existence Before Usage
    code: "std::string patternName = \"QuestingBehavior\";\nconst ActivityPattern*\
      \ questPattern = scheduler.GetPattern(patternName);\nif (questPattern) {\n \
      \   // Safe to use the pattern\n    bot->SetCurrentActivity(questPattern);\n\
      } else {\n    // Fallback logic or error reporting\n    LOG_WARN(\"bot\", \"\
      Missing questing behavior pattern: {}\", patternName);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the internal pattern collection,
    so performance may degrade with large numbers of patterns. The returned pointer
    remains valid only as long as the BotScheduler instance and its patterns are not
    modified. This method is thread-safe if the underlying pattern collection is not
    modified concurrently.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before using the returned ActivityPattern
    pointer to avoid dereferencing a null pointer. Modifying the returned pattern
    through other interfaces may lead to unexpected behavior or inconsistencies in
    bot behavior execution.
