documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotPacketRelay instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotPacketRelay class is responsible for cleaning
    up any allocated memory or resources used by the relay object. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this class likely manages packet forwarding between
    bots and the game server. When a BotPacketRelay instance is destroyed, it ensures
    that all pending packets are properly handled and that any internal data structures
    are freed to prevent memory leaks. This method is automatically invoked when the
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotPacketRelay instance
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    BotPacketRelay relay;\n    // ... use relay\
      \ ...\n    // relay is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotPacketRelay pointer
    code: 'BotPacketRelay* relay = new BotPacketRelay();

      // ... use relay ...

      delete relay; // Triggers ~BotPacketRelay()

      relay = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only on valid instances of BotPacketRelay.
    It is important that the class does not hold references to other objects that
    might be destroyed before this one, as this could lead to undefined behavior.
    The destruction process may involve cleanup of internal packet queues or network
    connections.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly unless you're explicitly managing memory
    manually. In most cases, the destructor is invoked automatically by the C++ runtime
    when an object goes out of scope or is deleted. Avoid double-deleting objects
    to prevent memory corruption.
