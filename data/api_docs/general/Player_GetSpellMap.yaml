  class: Player
  method: GetSpellMap
  signature: PlayerSpellMap & Player::GetSpellMap()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell map associated with the player, allowing access to all
    learned spells and their data.
  description: The GetSpellMap method provides access to the player's spell map, which
    contains all the spells the player has learned. This map is essential for managing
    spell-related data, including spell cooldowns, spell learning status, and spell-specific
    information. The returned reference allows direct manipulation of the spell list
    without creating a copy, making it efficient for performance-sensitive operations.
    The method is typically used in conjunction with other spell management functions
    to retrieve or modify spell data within the player's character.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to the PlayerSpellMap object, which contains all spells
    learned by the player. This reference allows direct access and modification of
    the spell list, enabling efficient handling of spell-related operations without
    copying data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Map Access
    code: 'PlayerSpellMap& spellMap = player->GetSpellMap();

      // Use spellMap to access or modify spell data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Specific Spell Data
    code: "PlayerSpellMap& spellMap = player->GetSpellMap();\nSpellInfo* spellInfo\
      \ = spellMap.GetSpellInfo(12345);\nif (spellInfo)\n{\n    // Process spell info\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be safely used in multi-threaded environments.
    Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary copies of the spell map,
    as the returned reference allows direct access to the underlying data structure.
    This method is commonly used in spell-related operations within TrinityCore's
    core systems.
  warnings: No specific warnings for this method. However, developers should be aware
    that modifying the spell map directly can affect spell cooldowns and learning
    status if not handled carefully. Always ensure proper validation when manipulating
    spell data.
