  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: DeleteFromDB
  signature: void BlackMarketEntry::DeleteFromDB(int trans) const
documentation:
  brief: Removes the black market entry from the database.
  description: The DeleteFromDB method removes the current BlackMarketEntry instance
    from the database. This method is typically used when a black market item needs
    to be deleted or removed from the auction house system. The operation may involve
    transaction handling depending on the implementation, and it's usually called
    in the context of black market item management within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server. The method does not return any value and operates directly on the instance
    it is called from.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Optional transaction identifier used for database operations. If
      provided, the deletion will be performed within the specified transaction context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BlackMarketEntry entry;

      // ... populate entry with data ...

      entry.DeleteFromDB();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Transaction
    code: 'Transaction trans = new Transaction();

      BlackMarketEntry entry;

      // ... populate entry with data ...

      entry.DeleteFromDB(trans);

      delete trans;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the database state and should be used carefully.
    It's recommended to ensure that all references to this black market entry are
    properly cleaned up after deletion. The method may perform additional cleanup
    operations internally, such as removing related auction data or updating internal
    caches.
  warnings: Calling DeleteFromDB on an entry that is currently being referenced elsewhere
    in the system can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that no
    other systems are actively using this entry before deletion. Additionally, if
    a transaction is passed, ensure it's properly committed or rolled back after the
    operation.
