  class: RoleAssignmentHandler
  method: RoleAssignmentHandler
  signature: void RoleAssignmentHandler::RoleAssignmentHandler(BotAI * botAI)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a role assignment handler for bot AI with the specified bot AI
    instance.
  description: The RoleAssignmentHandler constructor initializes a role assignment
    handler that manages how bots assign and execute roles within the TrinityCore
    framework. This handler is responsible for determining appropriate roles for bots
    based on game state, player needs, and strategic requirements. It integrates with
    the broader BotAI system to ensure coordinated behavior among multiple bots in
    group scenarios such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds. The handler typically
    sets up internal data structures and registers necessary callbacks for role management
    events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Assignment Handler Initialization
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();

      RoleAssignmentHandler handler(botAI);

      // The handler is now initialized and ready to manage role assignments for the
      bot AI instance.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any immediate role assignment; it only
    initializes the handler. Role assignments are typically triggered by external
    events or periodic updates within the BotAI system. The handler assumes that the
    provided BotAI pointer is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this constructor will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the BotAI instance is fully constructed before
    passing it to this handler.
