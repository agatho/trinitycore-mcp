  signature: void ObjectData::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the object, resetting all tracked field modifications.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with an ObjectData instance. This mask is used to track which fields of the object
    have been modified since the last update or synchronization. By clearing the mask,
    the system effectively forgets about any pending changes, marking all fields as
    'unchanged'. This is typically called after sending updates to clients or when
    synchronizing state. The method does not modify the actual field values but only
    resets the tracking mechanism.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Update
    code: 'ObjectData* data = player->GetObjectData();

      // ... perform some modifications ...

      data->ClearChangesMask(); // Reset changes mask after sending updates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in the context of packet serialization and network
    synchronization where it's important to distinguish between changed and unchanged
    fields. It's typically invoked during the process of building update packets or
    when explicitly resetting object state for synchronization purposes.
