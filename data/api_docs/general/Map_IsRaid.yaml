  class: Map
  method: IsRaid
  signature: bool Map::IsRaid() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is a raid instance.
  description: The IsRaid method checks if the current Map object represents a raid
    instance, which is typically used for dungeons or raids that require multiple
    players to complete. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to distinguish between normal and raid content. The method returns true
    when the map is designated as a raid, indicating that it has special raid-related
    properties such as player limits, difficulty settings, or specific game mechanics.
    It is often used in conjunction with other map-related methods to determine the
    type of instance being accessed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current map is a raid instance, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the map has raid-specific properties such as player limits or
    difficulty settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (map->IsRaid()) {\n    // Handle raid-specific logic\n    // e.g., player\
      \ limits, difficulty settings\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with map type checking
    code: "Map* map = player->GetMap();\nif (map && map->IsRaid()) {\n    // Perform\
      \ actions specific to raid maps\n    // e.g., check if players are in a raid\
      \ group\n}\nelse {\n    // Handle normal instance logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related methods
    to determine the type of instance being accessed. It's important to note that
    this method may not be available in all map types, and its behavior depends on
    the specific implementation within TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return false for maps that are not explicitly
    classified as raid instances but still contain raid content. Also, this method
    is typically used in conjunction with other methods to determine instance type,
    so it's important to check all related methods when determining map properties.
