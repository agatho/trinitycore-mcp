documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another LFGBotSelector instance to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator for LFGBotSelector transfers all resources
    and state from the source LFGBotSelector object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate objects need to
    be efficiently transferred without unnecessary copying. The method ensures that
    the moved-from object is left in a valid but unspecified state, suitable for subsequent
    use or destruction. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    this operator supports efficient resource management for LFG (Looking For Group)
    bot selection logic, particularly when dealing with temporary selector objects
    during group formation processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current LFGBotSelector object after the move assignment
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'LFGBotSelector selector1;

      LFGBotSelector selector2 = std::move(selector1); // Uses move assignment

      // selector1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<LFGBotSelector> selectors;

      selectors.emplace_back();

      selectors.back() = std::move(anotherSelector); // Move assignment into container

      // anotherSelector is left in valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should
    only be called on rvalue references. The moved-from object must not be accessed
    after the operation, as it's left in a valid but unspecified state. When implementing
    this for LFG bot selection, ensure that any internal data structures or cached
    values are properly transferred to maintain consistent behavior.
  warnings: Never use the moved-from object after calling move assignment. The object
    will be in a valid but unspecified state and accessing its members may lead to
    undefined behavior. Be cautious when using this with objects that hold resources
    like database connections or file handles, as those resources will be transferred
    without duplication.
