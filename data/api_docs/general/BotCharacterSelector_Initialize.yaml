  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotCharacterSelector::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot character selector system and prepares it for use.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state and resources required
    for the BotCharacterSelector class to function properly. This includes loading
    configuration data, initializing data structures, and preparing any necessary
    subsystems. The method performs validation checks to ensure that all prerequisites
    are met before the selector can be used to choose or manage bot characters. It
    returns a boolean value indicating whether the initialization process was successful.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization completed successfully and all required
    resources were properly set up; otherwise, returns false if any error occurred
    during initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "BotCharacterSelector selector;\nbool success = selector.Initialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Proceed with bot character selection logic\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during the system startup or
    when the bot manager is initialized. It's important to check the return value
    to ensure that subsequent operations on the selector are valid.
