documentation:
  brief: Removes a timed quest from the player's quest log.
  description: The RemoveTimedQuest method removes a specific timed quest from the
    player's active quest log. This method is typically used when a quest has been
    completed or when the player needs to remove a quest that is no longer available.
    The method ensures that the quest is properly removed from the player's quest
    tracking system, preventing further progress on the quest and clearing any associated
    quest objectives. It does not affect the quest's completion status or reward,
    but rather removes it from active memory.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be removed. This value must
      correspond to a valid quest ID that exists in the player's current quest log.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveTimedQuest(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nif (player->HasQuest(questId))\
      \ {\n    player->RemoveTimedQuest(questId);\n}\n// This ensures the quest is\
      \ removed only if it exists in the player's quest log"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the player's
    quest progression. It is typically called during quest completion or when a quest
    needs to be removed from the player's active list. The method may also trigger
    updates to the player's quest log UI if the quest removal affects visible quest
    objectives.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest tracking and may
    cause issues with quest completion status. It should only be called for quests
    that are currently active in the player's quest log, otherwise it could cause
    errors or inconsistencies in the quest system.
