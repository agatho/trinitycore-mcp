    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum reputation value allowed for a specified faction.
  description: The GetMaxReputation method returns the maximum reputation threshold
    that can be achieved with a given faction. This value determines the upper limit
    of reputation points a player can attain with that faction, typically corresponding
    to the 'Exalted' reputation level. The method takes a FactionEntry pointer as
    input and retrieves the maximum reputation value associated with that faction
    entry. It is commonly used in reputation management systems to validate or cap
    reputation gains, determine faction status levels, or enforce game balance mechanics
    related to faction progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 representing the maximum reputation value allowed for
    the specified faction. This value typically corresponds to the Exalted reputation
    level (usually 42000 points in most World of Warcraft expansions), but may vary
    depending on faction-specific configurations and game updates.
  examples:
  - title: Get Maximum Reputation for a Faction
    code: 'const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(72); // Example:
      Gnomeregan

      int32 maxRep = reputationMgr->GetMaxReputation(faction);

      // Returns 42000 for most factions including Gnomeregan'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal faction database configuration and may
    be affected by game balance changes or custom modifications. The returned value
    represents the maximum reputation threshold, not the actual current reputation
    of a player with that faction.
  warnings: Ensure that the FactionEntry pointer passed to this method is valid and
    not null, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    in the game client.
