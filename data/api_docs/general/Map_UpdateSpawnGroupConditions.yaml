documentation:
  brief: Updates spawn group conditions for all objects in the map
  description: This method updates the spawn conditions for all spawn groups within
    the map, ensuring that objects are properly spawned or despawned based on their
    current condition states. It is typically called during map initialization or
    when spawn conditions change, and handles the logic for determining which objects
    should be active or inactive in the world. The method operates on a per-map basis
    and manages the internal state of spawn groups to maintain game consistency.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = sObjectAccessor->GetMap(0);

      map->UpdateSpawnGroupConditions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during map loading or when spawn conditions
    are modified. It may be called multiple times per frame depending on the number
    of spawn groups present in the map. Performance considerations include checking
    for condition changes and updating object states accordingly.
  warnings: Improper handling of spawn group conditions can lead to objects being
    spawned or despawned incorrectly, potentially causing visual glitches or missing
    NPCs/ GameObjects in the world.
