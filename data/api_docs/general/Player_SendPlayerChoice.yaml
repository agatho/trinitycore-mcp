documentation:
  brief: Sends a player choice dialog to the client with specified sender and choice
    ID
  description: The SendPlayerChoice method is used to display a player choice dialog
    in the game client, allowing players to make selections from available options.
    This method is typically invoked when a player interacts with an NPC or object
    that presents choices, such as quest givers or vendors. The method sends a specific
    choice ID to the client, which can be used to determine what action should be
    taken based on the player's selection. It is part of the broader player interaction
    system and is essential for handling player choice selections in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: sender
    description: The sender ID that identifies the entity initiating the choice dialog,
      typically an NPC or object. This value determines which dialog is displayed
      to the player.
  - name: choiceId
    description: The specific choice ID that represents the option being presented
      to the player. This ID corresponds to a specific choice in the database and
      determines what action will be taken when the player selects an option.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendPlayerChoice(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "if (player->GetPlayerChoice() != nullptr) {\n    player->SendPlayerChoice(12345,\
      \ 67890);\n}\nelse {\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player interaction
    methods and requires that the player be in a valid state to receive the choice
    dialog. It may trigger additional game mechanics such as quest progression or
    NPC dialogue updates depending on the context.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to client-side errors or incorrect
    choice selections, potentially causing issues with quest progression or NPC interactions.
    Care should be taken when setting sender and choice IDs to ensure they match valid
    database entries.
