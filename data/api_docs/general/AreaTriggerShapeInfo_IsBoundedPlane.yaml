documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the area trigger shape represents a bounded plane.
  description: The IsBoundedPlane method checks if the current AreaTriggerShapeInfo
    instance defines a bounded plane shape. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    area triggers can have various geometric shapes such as circles, boxes, or planes.
    A bounded plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions but
    is limited by some boundary constraints. This method returns true if the shape
    is specifically configured as a bounded plane, which affects how the trigger interacts
    with game entities and determines collision detection behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger shape is a bounded plane; otherwise, returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Area Trigger Shape is Bounded Plane
    code: "AreaTriggerShapeInfo shape;\n// Assume shape has been initialized with\
      \ a bounded plane\nif (shape.IsBoundedPlane()) {\n    // Handle bounded plane\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"This area trigger uses a bounded plane shape.\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle other shapes\n    printf(\"This area trigger does not\
      \ use a bounded plane shape.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with area trigger processing
    logic to determine how to handle entity interactions within the defined shape
    boundaries. The implementation likely involves checking internal flags or properties
    of the shape configuration.
