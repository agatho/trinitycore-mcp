    ProfessionAutomationProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the automation profile for a player's profession.
  description: The SetAutomationProfile method assigns a specific automation configuration
    to a player's profession, allowing the game to control how crafting actions are
    performed automatically. This method is typically used in conjunction with profession-related
    systems where players can define automated behaviors for their crafting routines.
    The profile contains settings such as which recipes to craft, how many times to
    repeat them, and other automation preferences. This method does not validate the
    profile contents but assumes they are properly constructed before being passed
    to the function.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose profession automation
      profile is being set. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: profile
    description: A const reference to a ProfessionAutomationProfile object containing
      the automation settings for the player's profession. This includes recipe preferences,
      repetition counts, and other crafting behavior configurations.
  returns: null

  notes: This method likely updates internal player data structures related to profession
    automation. It may trigger a save operation or send updates to the client depending
    on implementation details.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided profile is valid and properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid profiles could lead to unexpected behavior during
