    priority, int targetGuid, float distance, int angle, int duration, std::string
    reason, std::string sourceSystem)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a movement request to follow a target player with specified parameters.
  description: The MakeFollowMovement method generates a MovementRequest object that
    instructs a bot to follow another player within a defined distance and angle.
    This method is typically used in AI-driven player bots to simulate following behavior
    in World of Warcraft environments. The request includes priority, target GUID,
    distance, angle, duration, and reason for the movement. It integrates with TrinityCore's
    movement system to queue and execute the follow action according to the provided
    parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level of this movement request, determining how soon
      it should be processed relative to other movements.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player to follow. Must
      correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  - name: distance
    description: The desired distance to maintain from the target player, in yards.
      A value of 0 typically means to follow as closely as possible.
  - name: angle
    description: The angular offset (in degrees) from the target's facing direction
      to position the bot. Values range from -180 to 180 degrees.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in seconds for which this follow movement should be
      active. A value of 0 indicates indefinite follow.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining why the bot is following the target,
      useful for debugging or logging purposes.
  - name: sourceSystem
    description: The name or identifier of the system that initiated this movement
      request, for tracking and categorization.
  returns: A MovementRequest object configured with the specified follow parameters,
    ready to be queued for execution by the bot's movement system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Follow Request
    code: MovementRequest request = bot->MakeFollowMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::High,
      targetPlayerGuid, 3.0f, 0, 60, "Following target", "QuestSystem");
    language: cpp
  - title: Indefinite Follow with Angle Offset
    code: MovementRequest request = bot->MakeFollowMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::Normal,
      targetPlayerGuid, 5.0f, 45, 0, "Following with offset", "GroupSystem");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately execute the movement; it constructs a request
    that will be processed by the bot's movement handler. The target player must be
    within the same map and instance for the follow to work correctly. The angle parameter
    allows for positioning relative to the target, which can be useful in group scenarios
    or when avoiding obstacles.
  warnings: Ensure the targetGuid refers to a valid player; otherwise, the movement
    request may fail silently or cause unexpected behavior. Setting duration to 0
    creates an indefinite follow, which should be managed carefully to prevent infinite
    loops or performance issues.
