documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the item is involved in a specific quest by its quest ID
  description: The hasInvolvedQuest method determines if the current item is associated
    with a particular quest identified by the provided quest ID. This functionality
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft's quest system to verify item participation
    in quests, such as checking if an item is required for quest completion or if
    it was obtained through a quest. The method typically queries internal quest-related
    data structures within the TrinityCore framework to determine the relationship
    between the item and the specified quest.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The quest identifier (ID) to check against the item's quest involvement
      list
  returns: Returns true if the item is involved in the specified quest, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Involvement Check
    code: "if (item->hasInvolvedQuest(12345)) {\n    // Item is involved in quest\
      \ 12345\n    printf(\"Item is required for quest 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Logic
    code: "uint32 questId = player->GetQuestSlotQuestId(0);\nif (questId && item->hasInvolvedQuest(questId))\
      \ {\n    // Item is involved in the active quest\n    player->AddItem(item,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup in internal quest item associations.
    It may be used during quest tracking, quest completion verification, or when determining
    if an item should be highlighted or interacted with in the quest log UI.
  warnings: The method assumes that the quest ID provided is valid and exists in the
    database; invalid quest IDs might return false without error. Be cautious when
    using this method in performance-critical code paths as it may involve database
    lookups or internal data structure traversals.
