  class: EvokerAI
  method: OnCombatStart
  signature: void EvokerAI::OnCombatStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes evoker AI behavior when entering combat with a target
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when an Evoker AI creature begins
    combat with a target. This method sets up initial combat state, initializes combat-related
    variables, and prepares the AI for executing combat abilities. It typically handles
    the setup of target tracking, threat generation, and any pre-combat initialization
    required for evoker-specific mechanics such as spell casting or ability usage.
    The method is part of the standard TrinityCore AI framework and is called automatically
    by the core when combat begins.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target entity that initiated combat. This parameter
      represents the unit (player or creature) against which the evoker will engage
      in combat. The target may be null if no valid combat target exists.
  returns: No return value
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom AI implementation
    code: "class MyEvokerAI : public EvokerAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatStart(int*\
      \ target) override {\n        // Call base class implementation\n        EvokerAI::OnCombatStart(target);\n\
      \        \n        // Custom combat start logic\n        if (target)\n     \
      \       DoCast(target, SPELL_INITIAL_SPELL);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the TrinityCore core during combat initialization.
    Developers should ensure that any custom logic in overridden versions properly
    calls the base class implementation to maintain expected AI behavior. The target
    parameter may be null, so proper null checking is recommended.
  warnings: Do not modify the target pointer directly within this method as it might
    affect core combat handling. Ensure all custom logic is thread-safe if used in
    multi-threaded environments.
