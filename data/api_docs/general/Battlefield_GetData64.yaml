  class: Battlefield
  method: GetData64
  signature: int Battlefield::GetData64(int dataId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a 64-bit data value associated with a specific identifier from
    the battlefield.
  description: The GetData64 method is used to retrieve a 64-bit integer value that
    corresponds to a given data identifier within the Battlefield context. This method
    typically serves as part of the battlefield's data management system, allowing
    access to various battlefield-specific parameters or state information. It is
    commonly used in battleground scripting and event handling to fetch relevant data
    such as player counts, objectives, or other dynamic battlefield metrics. The method
    operates on a predefined set of data identifiers and returns an integer value
    representing the requested data. This function is essential for implementing dynamic
    battlefield behaviors and maintaining synchronization between server-side state
    and client-side updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int representing the 64-bit data value associated with the specified
    data identifier. The actual value depends on the dataId parameter and the current
    battlefield state. Returns 0 if the dataId is invalid or not found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Player Count
    code: "int playerCount = battlefield->GetData64(DATA_PLAYER_COUNT);\nif (playerCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process player count\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BATTLEFIELD_PLAYER_COUNT,\
      \ playerCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Objective Status
    code: "int objectiveStatus = battlefield->GetData64(DATA_OBJECTIVE_STATUS);\n\
      switch (objectiveStatus)\n{\n    case OBJECTIVE_COMPLETE:\n        // Handle\
      \ completed objective\n        break;\n    case OBJECTIVE_IN_PROGRESS:\n   \
      \     // Handle ongoing objective\n        break;\n    default:\n        //\
      \ Handle invalid status\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a virtual function in the Battlefield
    class hierarchy, allowing different battlefield types to provide their own data
    retrieval logic. The method should be called only when the battlefield instance
    is properly initialized and active. Performance considerations are minimal for
    this method since it's designed to return cached or pre-calculated values rather
    than performing expensive operations.
  warnings: Do not assume that all dataIds will return valid values. Always check
    the returned value for validity before using it in critical game logic. Calling
    GetData64 with an invalid dataId may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    gameplay state.
