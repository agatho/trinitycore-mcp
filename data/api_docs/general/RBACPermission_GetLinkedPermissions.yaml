    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the container of permissions linked to this RBAC permission.
  description: The GetLinkedPermissions method retrieves a constant reference to the
    RBACPermissionContainer that holds all permissions directly linked to this RBAC
    permission. This is used in the TrinityCore authentication and authorization system
    to determine which lower-level permissions are included within a higher-level
    permission node. The returned container allows iteration over all linked permissions,
    enabling systems to check for transitive permission grants or build comprehensive
    permission sets for user roles. This method does not modify any internal state
    and provides read-only access to the linked permission collection.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an RBACPermissionContainer containing all permissions
    directly linked to this RBAC permission. The container may be empty if no permissions
    are linked, but will never be null.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating over linked permissions
    code: "RBACPermission* perm = sAccountMgr->GetRBACPermission(123);\nif (perm)\n\
      {\n    const RBACPermissionContainer& linkedPerms = perm->GetLinkedPermissions();\n\
      \    for (auto it = linkedPerms.begin(); it != linkedPerms.end(); ++it)\n  \
      \  {\n        std::cout << \"Linked permission ID: \" << *it << std::endl;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if a specific permission is linked
    code: "RBACPermission* perm = sAccountMgr->GetRBACPermission(123);\nif (perm)\n\
      {\n    const RBACPermissionContainer& linkedPerms = perm->GetLinkedPermissions();\n\
      \    if (linkedPerms.find(456) != linkedPerms.end())\n    {\n        std::cout\
      \ << \"Permission 456 is linked to this permission\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, so the returned container should
    not be modified. The RBACPermissionContainer is typically implemented as a set
    or similar collection type for efficient lookup. This method is commonly used
    during permission evaluation and role assignment processes in TrinityCore's access
    control system.
  warnings: Modifying the returned container through a non-const reference would result
    in undefined behavior, as it's a const reference. Be aware that this method may
    be called frequently during permission checks, so performance considerations should
    be taken into account when iterating over large linked permission sets.
