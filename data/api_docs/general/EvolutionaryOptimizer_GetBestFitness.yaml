  brief: Returns the highest fitness value found by the evolutionary optimization
    algorithm
  description: The GetBestFitness method retrieves the best fitness score achieved
    during the evolutionary optimization process. This value represents the optimal
    solution found so far by the algorithm, typically indicating the highest fitness
    level among all individuals in the current population or across generations. The
    method is commonly used to monitor the progress of evolutionary algorithms and
    to determine when a satisfactory solution has been reached. In the context of
    TrinityCore's AI systems, this method might be used to track the performance of
    evolutionary neural networks or genetic algorithms used for behavior optimization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the highest fitness score found by the evolutionary
    optimizer. This value typically ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity
    depending on the fitness function implementation, with higher values indicating
    better solutions.
  examples:
  - title: Monitoring Evolutionary Progress
    code: "EvolutionaryOptimizer optimizer;\n// ... run optimization ...\nfloat bestFitness\
      \ = optimizer.GetBestFitness();\nif (bestFitness > 0.95f) {\n    // Solution\
      \ is sufficiently good\n    std::cout << \"Optimal solution found with fitness:\
      \ \" << bestFitness << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "class AIController {\npublic:\n    void Update() {\n        // ... other\
      \ AI logic ...\n        float currentBest = m_optimizer.GetBestFitness();\n\
      \        if (currentBest > m_bestKnownFitness) {\n            m_bestKnownFitness\
      \ = currentBest;\n            // Update behavior based on improved fitness\n\
      \        }\n    }\nprivate:\n    EvolutionaryOptimizer m_optimizer;\n    float\
      \ m_bestKnownFitness = 0.0f;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after an optimization cycle has completed
    or during ongoing evaluation. The returned value represents the global best fitness
    rather than local best fitness, making it suitable for tracking algorithm convergence.
    Implementation may cache the best fitness value to avoid recomputation.
  warnings: The method returns a cached value that might not reflect real-time changes
    if the optimizer's internal state has been modified since the last update. Ensure
    proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded environments.
