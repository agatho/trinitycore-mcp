documentation:
  brief: Updates the population counts for all zones in the bot lifecycle manager.
  description: The UpdateZonePopulations method is responsible for recalculating and
    refreshing the current population data for all zones managed by the BotLifecycleMgr.
    This method ensures that zone-specific bot population statistics are up-to-date,
    which is crucial for dynamic bot spawning and distribution logic within the game
    world. It typically iterates through all active zones, queries the current number
    of bots present in each zone, and updates internal tracking structures accordingly.
    The method may be invoked periodically or in response to specific events that
    affect bot distribution across zones.

  notes: This method should be called regularly to maintain accurate zone population
    data. It may involve database queries or internal lookups, so frequent execution
    could impact performance if not properly throttled.
