  signature: bool Player::SatisfyQuestExclusiveGroup(const Quest * qInfo, bool msg)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Satisfies a quest's exclusive group requirements for the player.
  description: This method checks if the player has met all requirements to complete
    a quest that belongs to an exclusive group. It verifies whether the player can
    proceed with the quest based on their current quest status and exclusive group
    constraints. The method returns true if the requirements are satisfied, false
    otherwise. This is typically used in quest completion logic where exclusive group
    quests must be completed before other quests in the same group can be accepted.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that contains the exclusive group information
      to be satisfied
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to send messages to player if requirements
      are not met
  returns: Returns true if the player satisfies the exclusive group requirements for
    the quest, false otherwise. The method may return false if the player has already
    completed the quest or if the quest is not part of an exclusive group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->SatisfyQuestExclusiveGroup(quest, true))\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "bool result = player->SatisfyQuestExclusiveGroup(&quest, false);\nif (result)\n\
      {\n    // Player can proceed with quest\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot proceed,\
      \ possibly due to exclusive group requirements\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest completion processing and may
    involve checking player's quest log status. It's important to note that this method
    does not actually complete the quest itself, but rather verifies if the player
    can proceed with it based on exclusive group constraints.
  warnings: The method should be called only when the player is in a valid state for
    quest completion. Calling this method outside of proper quest context may lead
    to unexpected behavior or errors.
