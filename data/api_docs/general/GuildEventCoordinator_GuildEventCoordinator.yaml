documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GuildEventCoordinator instance with default settings and
    empty event queues.
  description: The GuildEventCoordinator constructor initializes the internal state
    of a guild event coordinator object. This includes setting up default configurations,
    initializing empty queues for pending events, and preparing the object to handle
    guild-related events such as member promotions, demotions, invitations, and other
    administrative actions. The coordinator is designed to manage asynchronous event
    processing within the context of World of Warcraft's guild system, ensuring that
    events are properly queued and handled according to game rules and timing requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GuildEventCoordinator instance
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator* coordinator = new GuildEventCoordinator();

      // The coordinator is now ready to process guild events

      coordinator->ScheduleEvent(GUILD_EVENT_MEMBER_ADDED, 12345);

      // Process queued events

      coordinator->ProcessEvents();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any network communication or database access.
    It only initializes internal data structures and prepares the object for event
    handling. The actual processing of guild events requires calling methods like
    ScheduleEvent() and ProcessEvents().
