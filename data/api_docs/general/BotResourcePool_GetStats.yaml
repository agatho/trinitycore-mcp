documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current resource pool statistics for a bot
  description: The GetStats method returns a constant reference to the PoolStats structure
    that contains detailed information about the bot's current resource usage and
    allocation. This includes data such as available resources, maximum capacity,
    and utilization percentages. The returned statistics are updated in real-time
    as the bot's resource consumption changes during gameplay. This method is typically
    used by the AI system to make decisions based on available resources or to monitor
    resource efficiency.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a PoolStats object containing current resource
    pool statistics including utilization metrics, capacity information, and resource
    counts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'const PoolStats& stats = bot->GetResourcePool()->GetStats();

      uint32 available = stats.available;

      uint32 total = stats.total;

      float utilization = (float)available / (float)total;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Resource Usage
    code: "BotResourcePool* pool = bot->GetResourcePool();\nconst PoolStats& stats\
      \ = pool->GetStats();\nif (stats.utilization > 0.9f) {\n    // Alert: High resource\
      \ usage\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Bot %u resource pool at %f utilization\"\
      , bot->GetGUID().GetCounter(), stats.utilization);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PoolStats reference is valid only until the next call to GetStats
    or until the resource pool is modified. The method is thread-safe and can be called
    from any thread context. Performance impact is minimal as it only returns cached
    statistics.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned PoolStats object directly, as it's a constant
    reference. Modifications should be made through appropriate setter methods on
    the BotResourcePool class. The statistics may change between calls if the bot's
    resource usage is dynamic.
