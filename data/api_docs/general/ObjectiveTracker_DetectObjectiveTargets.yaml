  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: DetectObjectiveTargets
  signature: int ObjectiveTracker::DetectObjectiveTargets(Player * bot, const QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Detects and returns the number of valid targets for a given quest objective.
  description: The DetectObjectiveTargets method evaluates a specified quest objective
    and identifies how many valid targets (such as NPCs, game objects, or items) are
    currently available for the player to interact with in order to complete that
    objective. This method is typically used by AI systems or automated quest completion
    logic within the TrinityCore framework. It checks the current state of the world
    and player context to determine target availability, considering factors like
    quest status, object visibility, and player proximity. The return value indicates
    the count of valid targets found, which can be zero if no suitable targets exist
    or a positive integer representing the number of actionable items.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player whose
      quest objectives are being evaluated. This parameter is required and must not
      be null.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific quest objective to evaluate. This includes details such as
      objective type, target ID, count needed, and other relevant metadata.
  returns: An integer representing the number of valid targets detected for the given
    quest objective. Returns zero if no targets are found or if the objective is already
    completed. A positive value indicates that there are valid targets available for
    interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to detect quest objectives
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized player\nQuestObjectiveData objective\
      \ = ...; // Assume initialized objective data\nint targetCount = bot->GetObjectiveTracker()->DetectObjectiveTargets(bot,\
      \ objective);\nif (targetCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with interaction logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Found %d valid targets for the objective\\n\", targetCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI-driven quest completion systems. It relies
    on the current state of the game world and may involve expensive operations such
    as scanning nearby entities or checking quest status. Performance considerations
    should be taken into account when calling this method frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and objective parameters are valid before calling
    this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The method does not modify
    any state directly but depends on external systems to determine target validity.
