  method: UseHealthstone
  signature: bool WarlockAI::UseHealthstone()
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to use a healthstone item if available and beneficial for the warlock.
  description: The UseHealthstone method checks whether the WarlockAI instance has
    a healthstone available in its inventory and determines if using it would be beneficial
    based on current health conditions. It evaluates the warlock's current health
    percentage and compares it against a threshold to decide whether to consume a
    healthstone. This method is typically called during AI decision-making processes
    when the warlock needs to maintain survivability. The method returns true if a
    healthstone was successfully used, or false if no suitable opportunity was found
    or if the use was prevented by game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a healthstone was successfully consumed and the warlock's
    health was restored; otherwise returns false if no healthstone was available,
    conditions were not met for usage, or if the action failed for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (warlockAI->UseHealthstone()) {\n    // Healthstone was used successfully\n\
      \    // Perform additional actions after healing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WarlockAI class and integrates with TrinityCore's
    AI framework. It assumes that the warlock has access to healthstone items in its
    inventory and that appropriate game conditions are met for item usage. The decision
    to use a healthstone may depend on internal thresholds or configurations defined
    within the AI module.
  warnings: Ensure that the WarlockAI instance is properly initialized and has valid
    access to the player's inventory before calling this method. Improper usage without
    checking prerequisites can lead to unexpected behavior or errors in AI decision-making.
