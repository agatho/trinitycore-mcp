  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SetPositionManager
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetPositionManager(PositionManager * manager)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the position manager for the threat coordinator to use in managing creature
    positioning and threat calculations.
  description: The SetPositionManager method assigns a PositionManager instance to
    the ThreatCoordinator, which is responsible for handling positional data related
    to threat generation and management. This method allows the threat system to accurately
    calculate and maintain threat levels based on creature positions within the game
    world. The assigned PositionManager is typically used during combat scenarios
    where positioning affects threat distribution among multiple targets. This method
    should be called before any threat calculations are performed to ensure proper
    functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: manager
    description: Pointer to a PositionManager instance that will handle positional
      data for threat calculations. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = new ThreatCoordinator();

      PositionManager* positionManager = new PositionManager();

      coordinator->SetPositionManager(positionManager);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Creature AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeThreatSystem()\n\
      \    {\n        ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = GetThreatCoordinator();\n \
      \       PositionManager* manager = new PositionManager();\n        coordinator->SetPositionManager(manager);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct assignment without any validation of the manager's
    internal state. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the PositionManager
    instance remains valid for the lifetime of the ThreatCoordinator. This method
    is typically called during initialization or when switching between different
    positioning strategies.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the PositionManager object is properly constructed and
    initialized before calling this method. Avoid calling this method while threat
    calculations are actively in progress.
