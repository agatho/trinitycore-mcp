  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void GuardianDruid::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the guardian druid's combat rotation based on the current target.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate combat actions for a Guardian Druid AI. This method evaluates
    the current state of the druid and its target to decide which abilities should
    be used next in the rotation, such as Mangle, Swipe, or other defensive or offensive
    spells. It typically integrates with the AI system to ensure optimal spell usage
    based on threat levels, health status, and combat conditions. The method is called
    regularly during combat to maintain an effective rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the current target of the
      Guardian Druid. This parameter must be a valid Unit instance; passing NULL may
      result in undefined behavior or errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "void GuardianDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Update the rotation with current target\n    m_guardianDruid->UpdateRotation(m_creature->getVictim());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within an AI update loop, and it's
    expected that the target unit is valid and in combat. The implementation may include
    checks for cooldowns, mana availability, and target conditions before executing
    actions.
