  class: SpellHistory
  method: IsPaused
  signature: bool SpellHistory::IsPaused() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the spell history is currently paused.
  description: The IsPaused method determines if the spell history tracking mechanism
    is currently suspended. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, spell
    history tracks cooldowns and recast delays for spells. When paused, spell recasts
    may be allowed immediately regardless of normal cooldown restrictions. This functionality
    is typically used during certain game states such as combat pauses or specific
    buff/debuff effects that temporarily disable cooldown tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell history is currently paused, false otherwise.
    A paused state allows spells to be cast without respecting their normal cooldown
    timers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetSpellHistory()->IsPaused()) {\n    // Handle logic when\
      \ spell history is paused\n    sLog->outString(\"Spell history is currently\
      \ paused.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "SpellHistory* spellHistory = player->GetSpellHistory();\nif (!spellHistory->IsPaused())\
      \ {\n    // Only allow spell casting if not paused\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ spellId, true);\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"Cannot cast spell - spell\
      \ history is paused.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with spell cooldown management
    systems. The pause state can be set by various game mechanics including certain
    abilities, buffs, or temporary game states like combat pauses. It's important
    to note that pausing spell history does not bypass all restrictions - it specifically
    affects cooldown enforcement.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combination with spell casting logic
    as it may allow for unintended behavior if not properly accounted for in cooldown
    systems. Always verify the intended game state before allowing spell casts based
    on this check.
