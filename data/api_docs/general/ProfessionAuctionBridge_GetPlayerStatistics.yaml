  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: GetPlayerStatistics
  signature: const ProfessionAuctionStatistics & ProfessionAuctionBridge::GetPlayerStatistics(uint32
    playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction statistics for a specified player.
  description: The GetPlayerStatistics method fetches the profession auction statistics
    associated with a given player identified by their GUID. These statistics typically
    include data such as the number of items sold, bought, or auctions created by
    the player within the context of the auction house system. The returned reference
    is const, indicating that the statistics should not be modified directly through
    this interface. This method is commonly used in the context of player performance
    tracking and auction house analytics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a ProfessionAuctionStatistics object containing
    the aggregated auction data for the specified player. The object will be valid
    if the player exists and has auction activity; otherwise, it may return default-initialized
    statistics or an empty structure depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Player Auction Statistics
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      const ProfessionAuctionStatistics& stats = bridge.GetPlayerStatistics(playerId);

      TC_LOG_INFO("auction", "Player %u has sold %u items.", playerId, stats.ItemsSold);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses cached or database-stored auction data. It is
    recommended to cache the result if multiple accesses are needed to avoid redundant
    lookups. The returned reference must not be modified directly as it's const.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    player in the database, otherwise behavior is undefined or may return default
    statistics.
