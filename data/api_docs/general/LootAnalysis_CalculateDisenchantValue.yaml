  signature: float LootAnalysis::CalculateDisenchantValue(const LootItem & item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the disenchant value of a loot item based on its quality and level.
  description: The CalculateDisenchantValue method determines the monetary value that
    a player would receive if they disenchant a specific loot item. This value is
    derived from the item's quality, level, and other intrinsic properties. The method
    is typically used in loot analysis systems to evaluate whether disenchanting an
    item is more profitable than keeping it. It takes into account game mechanics
    such as item rarity, spell power, and potential material yields. The calculation
    considers the item's base value and applies multipliers based on its quality tier
    (common, uncommon, rare, epic, etc.) and level relative to the player's level.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float representing the disenchant value of the item in gold pieces. Returns
    0.0 if the item cannot be disenchanted or if there are no valid disenchanting
    rules for the item type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LootItem item;

      // Assume item is initialized with valid data

      float value = lootAnalysis.CalculateDisenchantValue(item);

      printf("Disenchant value: %.2f gold\n", value);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparison with Item Value
    code: "LootItem item;\n// Assume item is initialized\nfloat disenchantValue =\
      \ lootAnalysis.CalculateDisenchantValue(item);\nfloat itemValue = item.item->SellPrice;\n\
      if (disenchantValue > itemValue)\n{\n    printf(\"Disenchanting is more profitable\\\
      n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Keeping the item is better\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal game data tables that define disenchant values
    for different item qualities and levels. The calculation may vary depending on
    the expansion or patch version of TrinityCore being used. Performance-wise, this
    method should be lightweight as it only performs mathematical operations on cached
    item properties.
  warnings: Ensure that the LootItem passed to this method is valid and properly initialized
    before calling. Passing an uninitialized or corrupted item reference could lead
    to incorrect calculations or undefined behavior. This method does not validate
    whether the player has the disenchanting ability; it only calculates the theoretical
    value.
