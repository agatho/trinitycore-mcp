  class: ChannelMgr
  method: LeftChannel
  signature: void ChannelMgr::LeftChannel(uint32 channelId, const AreaTableEntry *
    zoneEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from a specified channel when they leave it.
  description: The LeftChannel method is responsible for handling the removal of a
    player from a specific chat channel within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    is typically invoked when a player disconnects from the game or explicitly leaves
    a channel. It ensures proper cleanup of channel membership data and may trigger
    notifications to other channel members about the player's departure. The method
    takes into account the zone entry to determine if any zone-specific behavior should
    be applied during channel leave operations.
  parameters:
  - name: channelId
    description: The unique identifier of the channel from which the player is leaving.
      This ID corresponds to a specific chat channel instance in the game world.
  - name: zoneEntry
    description: Pointer to the AreaTableEntry structure representing the zone where
      the player was located when leaving the channel. Used for determining zone-specific
      channel behavior or restrictions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when a player leaves a channel
    code: 'ChannelMgr* channelMgr = sChannelMgr;

      uint32 channelId = 12345;

      AreaTableEntry const* zoneEntry = sAreaTableStore.LookupEntry(123);

      channelMgr->LeftChannel(channelId, zoneEntry);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal channel management system and should
    only be called by core subsystems handling player disconnection or channel operations.
    It does not perform any direct network communication; instead, it updates internal
    data structures and may queue messages for broadcast to other players in the channel.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid channelId or null zoneEntry pointer
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all parameters are validated
    before calling this method, especially in custom modules or addons.
