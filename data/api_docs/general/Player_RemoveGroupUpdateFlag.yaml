  class: Player
  method: RemoveGroupUpdateFlag
  signature: void Player::RemoveGroupUpdateFlag(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified group update flag from the player's group update mask.
  description: The RemoveGroupUpdateFlag method clears a specific flag from the player's
    internal group update mask. This is used in conjunction with group update mechanics
    to determine which attributes of a player need to be synchronized with the group
    members. The method operates on a bitmask that tracks various update states for
    group-related data such as health, power, equipment, and other player characteristics.
    When a flag is removed, it indicates that the corresponding attribute no longer
    requires an update broadcast to the player's group members. This method is typically
    called internally by the core when processing group update requests or when specific
    attributes are explicitly marked as unchanged.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The group update flag to remove from the player's update mask. This
      is a bitmask value representing specific attributes that can be updated in a
      group context, such as health, mana, equipment, or other player state information.
  returns: No return value.
  examples:
  - title: Removing a Health Update Flag
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->RemoveGroupUpdateFlag(GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG_HEALTH);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Multiple Flags in Sequence
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->RemoveGroupUpdateFlag(GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG_HEALTH);

      player->RemoveGroupUpdateFlag(GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG_POWER);

      player->RemoveGroupUpdateFlag(GROUP_UPDATE_FLAG_AURAS);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal group update system and should typically
    not be called directly by external code. The flags used with this method are usually
    defined in the core's group update constants. The method modifies an internal
    bitmask that affects how frequently updates are sent to group members, so it can
    have performance implications if used excessively.
  warnings: Calling this method without understanding the group update system may
    lead to inconsistent group member states. Improper use of flags can cause players
    to not receive necessary updates or cause unnecessary network traffic. This method
    should only be called when you understand the implications of removing specific
    update flags from the player's group update mask.
