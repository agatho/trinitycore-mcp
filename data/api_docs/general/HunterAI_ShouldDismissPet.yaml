  method: ShouldDismissPet
  signature: bool HunterAI::ShouldDismissPet() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter's pet should be dismissed based on current
    combat and game state conditions.
  description: The ShouldDismissPet method evaluates various conditions to decide
    if a hunter's pet should be dismissed from the battlefield. This includes checking
    if the pet is dead, if the hunter is in combat, or if specific game mechanics
    dictate that the pet should be removed. The method is typically used within the
    HunterAI class to manage pet behavior during encounters. It considers factors
    such as pet health, threat levels, and player actions to make this decision. This
    functionality is crucial for proper pet management in both PvE and PvP scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter's pet should be dismissed according to current
    game state and AI logic; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (hunterAI->ShouldDismissPet()) {\n    // Dismiss the pet\n    hunterAI->DismissPet();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with pet management system
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdatePetBehavior() {\n    if (ShouldDismissPet()) {\n \
      \       if (pet && pet->IsAlive()) {\n            DismissPet();\n        }\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Continue normal pet behavior\n        Pet->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making process for hunter pets.
    It's typically called during AI update cycles and may be influenced by various
    combat states, pet health thresholds, and player skill usage. The implementation
    likely involves checking pet status flags, combat state, and other contextual
    factors.
  warnings: Developers should be aware that dismissing a pet can have significant
    gameplay implications, especially in PvP scenarios where pet control is crucial.
    Ensure proper checks are made before calling this method to avoid unintended behavior
    or game state inconsistencies.
