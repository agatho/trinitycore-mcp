  class: TargetSelectionUtils
  method: IsGoodTankTarget
  signature: bool TargetSelectionUtils::IsGoodTankTarget(Unit * target, Player * tank)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit is suitable for a player to tank in World
    of Warcraft combat.
  description: The IsGoodTankTarget method evaluates if a given Unit target is appropriate
    for a Player to assume the role of tank. This evaluation considers various combat-related
    factors such as the target's threat level, distance from the tank, and whether
    the target is currently engaged with other players or creatures. The method ensures
    that the selected target is viable for maintaining aggro and managing combat effectively
    within the game's mechanics. It is typically used by AI systems or player commands
    to select optimal targets for tanking roles.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the potential target to
      be evaluated for tanking. This unit should be a valid creature or NPC that can
      be engaged in combat.
  - name: tank
    description: A pointer to the Player object who is attempting to tank the target.
      This player must be in a valid state to engage in combat and maintain threat.
  returns: Returns true if the target is suitable for the player to tank, meaning
    it meets criteria such as being within range, not already tanked by another player,
    and having sufficient threat level or engagement. Returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank Target Evaluation
    code: "if (TargetSelectionUtils::IsGoodTankTarget(targetUnit, playerTank)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with tanking logic\n    playerTank->SetTarget(targetUnit);\n\
      } else {\n    // Find another target\n    Unit* newTarget = FindNextValidTarget(playerTank);\n\
      \    playerTank->SetTarget(newTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tank Target Selection in AI Logic
    code: "class TankAI {\npublic:\n    void SelectBestTankTarget(Player* tank) {\n\
      \        for (auto& target : GetNearbyUnits(tank)) {\n            if (TargetSelectionUtils::IsGoodTankTarget(target,\
      \ tank)) {\n                tank->SetTarget(target);\n                return;\n\
      \            }\n        }\n        // No suitable targets found\n        tank->ClearTarget();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may consider factors like target's current threat status, distance
    from the tank, and whether other players are already targeting the same unit.
    It is recommended to call this method before assigning a target to a player for
    tanking purposes to ensure optimal gameplay balance.
  warnings: Ensure that both the target and tank parameters are valid pointers; passing
    null values may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This function should not
    be used in high-frequency loops without proper caching or optimization due to
    potential performance implications.
