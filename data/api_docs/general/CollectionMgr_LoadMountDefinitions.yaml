  signature: void CollectionMgr::LoadMountDefinitions()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all mount definitions from the database into memory
    for use in the CollectionMgr system.
  description: The LoadMountDefinitions method is responsible for retrieving all mount-related
    data from the game's database and caching it within the CollectionMgr class. This
    method ensures that all available mounts are properly loaded and accessible for
    player collection tracking, mount unlocking, and related gameplay mechanics. It
    typically executes during server startup or when the collection system is initialized,
    populating internal data structures with mount information such as display IDs,
    spell IDs, and unlock requirements. The method does not accept any parameters
    and performs no direct return operations; instead, it modifies the internal state
    of the CollectionMgr instance to reflect loaded mount definitions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'CollectionMgr* mgr = sCollectionMgr;

      mgr->LoadMountDefinitions(); // Called during server startup to load all mounts'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked once during server initialization and should
    not be called repeatedly. It assumes that the database connection is already established
    and that mount-related tables contain valid data. The loaded mount definitions
    are stored in internal containers for fast lookup during gameplay operations.
  warnings: Calling this method after mounts have already been loaded may result in
    duplicate entries or inconsistent state. Ensure this method is only called once
    during system initialization to avoid potential memory leaks or data corruption.
