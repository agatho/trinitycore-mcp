  class: SplineChainMovementGenerator
  method: Deactivate
  signature: void SplineChainMovementGenerator::Deactivate(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the spline chain movement generator, stopping any active spline-based
    movement for the unit.
  description: The Deactivate method terminates the current spline chain movement
    for a given unit, effectively halting any ongoing spline-based pathfinding or
    movement. This method is typically invoked when the movement generator needs to
    be disabled or reset, such as during unit state changes, combat transitions, or
    when switching to a different movement behavior. It ensures that the unit's movement
    state is properly cleaned up and that no residual spline data remains active.
    The method does not return any value and operates directly on the internal state
    of the movement generator.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose spline chain movement is to be deactivated.
      This parameter must not be null, as attempting to deactivate a movement generator
      for a null unit will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation of Spline Chain Movement
    code: 'Unit* targetUnit = ...; // Assume this is a valid Unit pointer

      SplineChainMovementGenerator* movementGen = ...; // Assume this is a valid movement
      generator

      movementGen->Deactivate(targetUnit);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on active movement generators. Calling
    Deactivate on an already inactive generator may lead to unexpected behavior or
    crashes if not properly checked beforehand. The internal state of the movement
    generator is modified directly, so it's important to ensure thread safety if multiple
    threads are manipulating the same unit's movement.
  warnings: Never pass a null pointer to this method as it will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the unit passed is valid and currently using
    this movement generator before calling Deactivate.
