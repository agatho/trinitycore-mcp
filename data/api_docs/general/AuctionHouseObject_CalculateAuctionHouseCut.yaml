  brief: Calculates the auction house cut from a bid amount
  description: This method computes the fee that the auction house takes from a successful
    bid amount. The calculation is based on the auction house's configured cut percentage,
    which is typically a fixed percentage of the final bid value. This method does
    not modify any internal state and can be called at any time to determine the fee
    for a given bid amount. It is used primarily during auction sales processing to
    determine how much the auction house retains as commission.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the calculated auction house cut as a uint64 value representing
    the amount in copper coins (the smallest unit of currency in World of Warcraft).
  examples:
  - title: Calculate Auction House Cut for a Bid
    code: 'uint64 bid = 1000000; // 100 gold

      uint64 cut = auctionHouse->CalculateAuctionHouseCut(bid);

      // Returns the auction house''s cut based on configured percentage'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal auction house configuration data that may vary
    between different server settings or game expansions. The returned value is always
    in copper coins, which is the base currency unit in World of Warcraft. This method
    should be called after verifying that the bid amount is valid and non-zero.
  warnings: Ensure that the bidAmount parameter is validated before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected results from invalid inputs such as zero or negative values.
    The auction house cut percentage may change between game versions or server configurations,
    so hardcoded values in code should not be relied upon.
