api:
  class: AuctionManager
  method: GetAuctionHouse
  signature: AuctionHouseObject * AuctionManager::GetAuctionHouse(Player * bot, uint32
    auctionHouseId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction house object associated with the specified auction
    house ID for a given player.
  description: The GetAuctionHouse method is used to obtain a pointer to an AuctionHouseObject
    that represents a specific auction house within the game world. This method takes
    a Player pointer and an auctionHouseId as parameters, and returns a pointer to
    the corresponding AuctionHouseObject. The auction house ID typically corresponds
    to different types of auction houses (e.g., Alliance, Horde, or neutral), each
    with its own unique identifier. This functionality is essential for managing player
    interactions with various auction houses in the game, such as placing bids, listing
    items, or browsing auctions. The method may internally perform lookups or caching
    operations to efficiently retrieve the requested auction house object.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the auction house is being
      retrieved. This parameter determines which player's context and potential access
      rights are considered when accessing the auction house.
  - name: auctionHouseId
    description: Unique identifier for the auction house type. This ID typically maps
      to specific auction house entries in the game database, such as 1 for Alliance,
      2 for Horde, or other values representing different auction houses in the game
      world.
  returns: Returns a pointer to an AuctionHouseObject that represents the specified
    auction house. If no valid auction house is found for the given ID, the method
    may return nullptr, indicating failure to retrieve the requested auction house.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AuctionHouseObject* ah = auctionManager->GetAuctionHouse(player, 1);\n\
      if (ah != nullptr)\n{\n    // Proceed with operations on the Alliance auction\
      \ house\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"auction\", \"Successfully retrieved Alliance auction\
      \ house\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Auction House Access
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nuint32 ahId = 2;\
      \ // Horde auction house ID\nAuctionHouseObject* ah = auctionManager->GetAuctionHouse(player,\
      \ ahId);\nif (ah != nullptr && player->GetTeam() == HORDE)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      auction\", \"Player can access Horde auction house\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"\
      auction\", \"Player cannot access specified auction house\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database lookups or internal caching mechanisms to
    efficiently retrieve auction house data. It is recommended to cache the returned
    pointer if it's used frequently to avoid repeated lookups. The method assumes
    that the player object passed in is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the auctionHouseId parameter corresponds to a valid auction
    house entry in the game database, otherwise the method may return nullptr. Also,
    be cautious when using this method in performance-critical sections of code as
    it might involve database or lookup operations.
