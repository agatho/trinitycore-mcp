documentation:
  brief: Resets combat-related statistics for the group combat trigger.
  description: The ResetStats method clears all accumulated combat metrics and state
    data within the GroupCombatTrigger instance. This includes resetting counters,
    timers, and any tracked combat events that may have occurred during previous encounters.
    The method is typically invoked when transitioning between different combat scenarios
    or when preparing the trigger for reuse in a new group encounter. It ensures that
    subsequent combat evaluations start with a clean slate, preventing carryover effects
    from prior engagements.

  notes: This method should be called before initializing a new combat scenario to
    ensure accurate tracking of group combat events. It does not affect the core configuration
    or state of the group itself, only the statistical tracking within the trigger.
