  signature: bool WeeklySpellUse::operator!=(const WeeklySpellUse & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two WeeklySpellUse objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this WeeklySpellUse
    object and another WeeklySpellUse object to determine if they are not equal. This
    comparison is typically used to check whether the weekly spell usage data differs
    in any way, such as different spell IDs, usage counts, or time stamps. The method
    returns true if the objects differ in any field, and false if all fields are identical.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this could be used
    to detect changes in a player's weekly spell usage tracking, which might affect
    quest progress or cooldown mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current WeeklySpellUse object is not equal to the provided
    right object; otherwise returns false. Equality is determined by comparing all
    relevant fields of both objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: 'WeeklySpellUse spell1;

      WeeklySpellUse spell2;

      // Assume spell1 and spell2 have different data

      bool areDifferent = (spell1 != spell2); // Returns true if they differ'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (playerWeeklySpell != newWeeklySpell)\n{\n    // Update player's spell\
      \ usage data\n    player->SetWeeklySpellUse(newWeeklySpell);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely compares internal member variables such as spell ID,
    weekly usage count, and timestamp. It is commonly used in containers like std::set
    or std::map where equality comparisons are required for element uniqueness.
