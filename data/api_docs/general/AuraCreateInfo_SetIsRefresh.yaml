  class: AuraCreateInfo
  method: SetIsRefresh
  signature: AuraCreateInfo & AuraCreateInfo::SetIsRefresh(bool * isRefresh)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the aura is a refresh operation for an existing aura.
  description: The SetIsRefresh method configures the AuraCreateInfo object to indicate
    that the aura being created is a refresh of an existing aura. This flag affects
    how the aura is applied and updated in the game world, particularly in relation
    to stacking behavior and duration resets. When set to true, the system will attempt
    to refresh the existing aura's duration rather than applying a new instance. This
    method is commonly used during spell effects that extend or renew existing buffs
    or debuffs.
  parameters:
  - name: isRefresh
    description: A boolean pointer indicating whether this aura should be treated
      as a refresh operation. If true, the aura will attempt to refresh an existing
      aura with the same spell ID; if false, it will create a new aura instance.
  returns: Returns a reference to the current AuraCreateInfo object, enabling method
    chaining for fluent interface patterns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of SetIsRefresh
    code: 'AuraCreateInfo createInfo;

      createInfo.SetIsRefresh(&true);

      // This creates an aura that will refresh existing auras with the same spell
      ID'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Refresh Flag to False
    code: 'bool isNotRefresh = false;

      AuraCreateInfo createInfo;

      createInfo.SetIsRefresh(&isNotRefresh);

      // This creates a new aura instance without attempting to refresh existing ones'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the AuraCreateInfo object and
    should be called before the aura is applied. The boolean value pointed to by 'isRefresh'
    must remain valid for the lifetime of the AuraCreateInfo object.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the refresh flag can lead to unexpected behavior in
    aura stacking and duration management. Ensure that the boolean pointer passed
    to this method remains valid and properly initialized.
