  signature: bool ClassAI::CanRequestBotSpellCast(int spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot can request to cast a specified spell based on current
    AI state and conditions.
  description: The CanRequestBotSpellCast method evaluates if a bot controlled by
    this ClassAI instance is currently able to initiate a spell cast for the given
    spell ID. This check typically considers factors such as the bot's current target,
    mana availability, spell cooldowns, line of sight, and other AI-related constraints.
    The method serves as a gatekeeper to prevent invalid or inappropriate spell casts
    during bot behavior execution. It is commonly used within the AI decision-making
    loop to validate whether a spell should be queued for casting.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot can request to cast the specified spell; otherwise,
    returns false. A return value of false indicates that either the spell is not
    valid for the current context, the bot lacks necessary resources (e.g., mana),
    or the AI state prevents casting at this time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (ai->CanRequestBotSpellCast(12345)) {\n    ai->RequestBotSpellCast(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform the actual spell casting; it only determines
    if a cast can be requested. Actual spell execution requires calling another method
    like RequestBotSpellCast(). The check may involve internal state tracking of the
    AI's current actions, target status, and resource availability.
  warnings: Ensure that spell IDs passed to this method are valid and known to the
    game system, as invalid spell IDs might lead to undefined behavior or silent failures.
    This method should not be used in performance-critical loops without considering
    potential overhead from internal checks.
