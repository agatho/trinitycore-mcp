documentation:
  brief: Logs a position update for a player during combat movement.
  description: The LogPositionUpdate method records positional data for a player in
    combat movement scenarios. It captures the player's current position relative
    to a target and includes a reason for the update, which helps in tracking movement
    behavior and debugging combat-related issues. This method is typically used within
    AI strategies to maintain accurate positioning during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose position is being logged. Must
      not be null.
  - name: targetPos
    description: Integer representing the target position coordinate. Used to determine
      relative positioning during combat movement.
  - name: reason
    description: String describing the reason for the position update. Helps in categorizing
      and analyzing movement patterns.
  returns: null

      \ reason) {\n    LogPositionUpdate(player, targetPos, reason);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CombatMovementStrategy class and is intended for
    internal AI use. It does not perform any direct movement actions but rather logs
    data for analysis or debugging purposes.
