  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: Process
  signature: bool BotAIInitializer::Process(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes bot AI initialization tasks and returns true if successful.
  description: The Process method in BotAIInitializer handles the core logic for initializing
    and updating bot AI behavior. It typically manages the state transitions, resource
    allocation, and execution of AI routines for game bots. This method is called
    periodically by the game loop to ensure that bot AI systems remain synchronized
    with the current game state. The method may perform various tasks such as pathfinding
    initialization, target selection, ability assignment, or other AI-related operations
    necessary for proper bot functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot AI initialization process completed successfully
    without errors, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates a
    failure in initializing one or more components required for bot AI operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    static BotAIInitializer initializer;\n    uint32\
      \ diff = GetTimeDiff();\n    if (!initializer.Process(diff))\n    {\n      \
      \  // Handle initialization failure\n        sLog->outError(\"Bot AI initialization\
      \ failed\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game update loop and should
    be called regularly to maintain bot AI functionality. The implementation may perform
    time-consuming operations, so it's important to ensure that this method doesn't
    block the main thread for extended periods. Consider performance implications
    when using this method in high-frequency update scenarios.
