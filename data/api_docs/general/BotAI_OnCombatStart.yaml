documentation:
  brief: Initializes bot AI behavior when entering combat with a target unit
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework when
    a bot character begins combat with a specified target unit. This method serves
    as the entry point for custom combat logic within the BotAI system, allowing developers
    to define specific behaviors such as spell casting, movement patterns, or tactical
    decisions upon entering combat. The method receives a pointer to the target Unit
    that triggered the combat state and is typically called during the initial phase
    of combat engagement. It's important to note that this method may be invoked multiple
    times during a single combat session if the bot switches targets or re-enters
    combat with different enemies.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the enemy target that initiated
      combat. This parameter is guaranteed to be valid and non-null when the method
      is called, though it may represent various types of units including players,
      creatures, or game objects depending on the bot's combat context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Start Implementation
    code: "void BotAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Log that combat has\
      \ started\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot %u entered combat with %s\", GetBot()->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ target->GetName());\n    \n    // Perform initial combat actions\n    if (target\
      \ && target->IsPlayer())\n    {\n        // Cast a basic spell on player targets\n\
      \        if (SpellInfo* spell = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345))\n        {\n\
      \            DoCast(target, spell);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotAI framework's core event handling system and
    should not be overridden lightly. The target parameter will always be a valid
    Unit object when this method is called. Developers should ensure that any actions
    taken within this method do not block or delay the AI thread for extended periods,
    as it can impact overall performance.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations in this method
    as it's called frequently during combat transitions. Also, be cautious about calling
    methods that might recursively trigger additional combat events, which could lead
    to stack overflow or unexpected behavior.
