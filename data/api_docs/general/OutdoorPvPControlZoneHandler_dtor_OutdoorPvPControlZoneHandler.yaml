documentation:
  brief: Destroys an OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler instance and releases its resources.
  description: The destructor for the OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the handler.
    This method is automatically invoked when an instance of OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's Outdoor
    PvP system, this handler manages control zone behaviors and events, so its destruction
    ensures proper cleanup of associated game state data. The destructor typically
    handles releasing references to zones, unregistering event handlers, and ensuring
    no dangling pointers remain in the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler handler;\n   \
      \ // handler is automatically destroyed when it goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler* handler = new OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler();

      // ... use the handler ...

      delete handler; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory
    through pointers. It is important to ensure that all derived classes properly
    implement their own destructors if they have resources to clean up, as destructors
    in C++ are not inherited by default. The OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler likely manages
    game state data related to outdoor PvP zones, so proper destruction ensures no
    memory leaks or invalid references remain after the handler is no longer needed.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor unless you are explicitly managing
    memory through raw pointers. Since this is a destructor, calling it directly will
    result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware that if this class has virtual methods,
    ensure proper inheritance hierarchy to avoid slicing or incomplete cleanup.
