documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot's group role changes within the EnhancedBotAI
    system
  description: The OnGroupRoleChanged method is invoked whenever a bot's assigned
    group role is updated in the EnhancedBotAI framework. This method processes the
    transition from one role to another, allowing the AI to adjust its behavior, tactics,
    and decision-making logic accordingly. The method typically updates internal state
    variables, recalculates priorities, and may trigger specific actions based on
    the new role assignment. It serves as a key component in maintaining dynamic group
    coordination and adaptive gameplay behavior for bots within TrinityCore's enhanced
    bot system.
  parameters:
  - name: newRole
    description: The new group role that the bot is being assigned to. Valid values
      typically correspond to predefined role constants such as LEADER, TANK, HEALER,
      or DAMAGE_DEALER. The exact numerical values depend on the EnhancedBotAI implementation
      and may vary based on the specific bot configuration.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Role Change Handling
    code: "void MyEnhancedBotAI::OnGroupRoleChanged(int newRole)\n{\n    switch (newRole)\n\
      \    {\n        case ROLE_LEADER:\n            // Switch to leadership behavior\n\
      \            m_isLeader = true;\n            break;\n        case ROLE_TANK:\n\
      \            // Prepare for tanking duties\n            m_isTank = true;\n \
      \           break;\n        default:\n            // Handle other roles or reset\n\
      \            m_isLeader = false;\n            m_isTank = false;\n          \
      \  break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be implemented to handle role transitions gracefully without
    causing abrupt behavior changes. It's recommended to validate the newRole parameter
    against expected values and potentially trigger additional state updates or notifications
    to other subsystems within the bot AI framework.
  warnings: Improper handling of role changes may lead to inconsistent bot behavior,
    incorrect targeting, or failure to perform role-specific duties. Ensure that all
    role-specific logic is properly initialized when this method is called.
