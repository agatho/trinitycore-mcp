  class: InterruptOptimizer
  method: OptimizeRotationForGroup
  signature: void InterruptOptimizer::OptimizeRotationForGroup(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the interrupt rotation for a specified group in the World of Warcraft
    TrinityCore environment.
  description: The OptimizeRotationForGroup method adjusts and fine-tunes the interrupt
    behavior of a player's rotation based on the provided group identifier. This method
    is typically used within AI or combat logic systems to ensure that interrupts
    are scheduled effectively according to group composition, role distribution, or
    encounter-specific strategies. It modifies internal state variables related to
    rotation timing and priority without returning any value. The method assumes that
    the group parameter refers to a valid group within the current player's context
    and may trigger recalculations of interrupt cooldowns or spell priorities.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier representing the group for which the rotation
      should be optimized. This value typically corresponds to a valid group index
      or ID used internally by TrinityCore's group management system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.OptimizeRotationForGroup(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimizing for Different Group Types
    code: 'InterruptOptimizer optimizer;

      int currentGroup = player->GetGroup()->GetId();

      optimizer.OptimizeRotationForGroup(currentGroup);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal AI state machines and should only
    be called when the player is part of a valid group. Performance-wise, it may involve
    recalculating interrupt priorities or cooldowns, so frequent calls could impact
    frame rate in high-frequency combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided group ID is valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. Calling this method outside of a proper combat or
    group context might lead to incorrect rotation optimization results.
