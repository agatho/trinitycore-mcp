  brief: Triggers a GUID warning message in the world context
  description: The TriggerGuidWarning method is used to generate and log a warning
    message related to GUID (Global Unique Identifier) handling within the World object.
    This method likely serves as a diagnostic tool or warning mechanism for developers
    or administrators to identify potential issues with GUID management, such as duplicate
    identifiers or invalid GUID usage. The method does not take any parameters and
    performs no direct actions on game objects, but rather emits a warning message
    that may be logged or displayed in the server console.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'World* world = World::instance();

      world->TriggerGuidWarning();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used during development or debugging phases to identify
    GUID-related issues. It may be conditionally compiled or only active in debug
    builds. The actual warning message content and logging destination would depend
    on the server's configuration and logging system.
  warnings: Calling this method in production environments without proper logging
    setup may result in silent operations. Ensure that appropriate logging levels
    are configured to capture these warnings effectively.
