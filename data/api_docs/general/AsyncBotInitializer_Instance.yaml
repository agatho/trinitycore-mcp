documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AsyncBotInitializer class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the AsyncBotInitializer
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's bot system to manage
    asynchronous initialization tasks for AI bots. The returned reference provides
    access to all public methods and members of the AsyncBotInitializer instance,
    enabling configuration and management of bot initialization processes. This pattern
    is essential for maintaining consistent state and resource management across multiple
    bot-related operations within the game server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single instance of the AsyncBotInitializer class. The
    method never returns a null pointer as it's implemented as a singleton with guaranteed
    instantiation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the singleton instance
    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer& initializer = AsyncBotInitializer::Instance();

      // Use the initializer to configure bot settings

      initializer.InitializeBots();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the instance for bot initialization
    code: "#include \"AsyncBotInitializer.h\"\n\nvoid SetupBots()\n{\n    AsyncBotInitializer&\
      \ instance = AsyncBotInitializer::Instance();\n    instance.SetMaxBots(50);\n\
      \    instance.InitializeBots();\n    instance.StartBotProcessing();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's implemented using the Meyer's singleton
    pattern, which ensures thread-safe initialization in C++11 and later. The singleton
    instance is created on first access and persists for the lifetime of the application.
    Developers should be aware that this method should only be called after the TrinityCore
    server has properly initialized its core systems.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method during early server startup before core systems
    are initialized, as it may lead to undefined behavior. Do not attempt to manually
    destroy or recreate the singleton instance, as this violates the singleton pattern
    and can cause memory corruption or resource leaks.
