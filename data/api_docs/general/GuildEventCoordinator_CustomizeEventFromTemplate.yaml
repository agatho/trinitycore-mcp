  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: CustomizeEventFromTemplate
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::CustomizeEventFromTemplate(GuildEvent & event,
    const std::string & templateName)
documentation:
  brief: Applies template settings to a guild event, customizing its properties based
    on predefined template data.
  description: The CustomizeEventFromTemplate method takes an existing GuildEvent
    object and applies configuration values from a named template. This allows for
    consistent event creation by reusing predefined settings such as event type, duration,
    rewards, and restrictions. The method modifies the provided event in-place, updating
    its properties according to the specified template. Templates are typically defined
    within the game's configuration files or database and contain default values that
    can be overridden or extended during event creation. This functionality supports
    guild event management by enabling rapid deployment of standardized events with
    minimal manual configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: Reference to the GuildEvent object that will be customized using
      template data. This event's properties will be modified in-place.
  - name: templateName
    description: String identifier for the template to apply. Must correspond to a
      valid predefined template name registered with the GuildEventCoordinator system.
      Template names are typically case-sensitive and must exactly match registered
      templates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Customization Using Template
    code: 'GuildEvent myEvent;

      std::string templateName = "WeeklyRaidEvent";

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CustomizeEventFromTemplate(myEvent, templateName);

      // myEvent is now configured with settings from the ''WeeklyRaidEvent'' template'
    language: cpp
  - title: Customizing Multiple Events from Same Template
    code: 'GuildEvent event1, event2, event3;

      std::string templateName = "GuildAchievementChallenge";

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CustomizeEventFromTemplate(event1, templateName);

      coordinator.CustomizeEventFromTemplate(event2, templateName);

      coordinator.CustomizeEventFromTemplate(event3, templateName);

      // All three events are now customized with the same template settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the specified template exists and is properly registered
    within the GuildEventCoordinator system. If a template name does not exist, behavior
    may be undefined or result in partial customization. The method modifies the event
    object directly without returning a new instance, so any existing event data will
    be overwritten by template values.
  warnings: Ensure that the templateName parameter exactly matches a registered template
    to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior. This method does not validate
    whether the resulting event configuration is valid for execution; additional validation
    may be required before scheduling events.
