  class: ClassAI
  method: IsInRange
  signature: bool ClassAI::IsInRange(int * target, int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a target is within the spell's range for the AI-controlled unit.
  description: The IsInRange method determines whether a specified target entity is
    within the valid range of a given spell for the AI-controlled unit. This method
    is typically used by AI scripts to evaluate whether a spell can be safely cast
    on a target without exceeding the spell's maximum range limitations. The method
    considers both the AI unit's current position and the target's position, taking
    into account the spell's range parameters as defined in the game database. It
    returns true if the target is within range, false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for proper AI behavior in combat scenarios where casting spells at
    inappropriate distances would be invalid or ineffective.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity's identifier
      (GUID). This value typically corresponds to a unit such as a player or creature
      that the AI is evaluating for spell targeting.
  - name: spellId
    description: Integer identifier of the spell being evaluated. This ID references
      a specific spell in the game's database, which contains range and other casting
      parameters used to determine validity.
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the target is within the spell's range.
    Returns true if the target is within range, false if it is outside the valid range
    for the specified spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (ai->IsInRange(&targetGuid, 12345)) {\n    // Cast spell since target\
      \ is in range\n    ai->CastSpell(targetGuid, 12345);\n} else {\n    // Move\
      \ closer or select another target\n    ai->MoveToTarget(targetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with multiple spell checks
    code: "if (ai->IsInRange(&targetGuid, 12345)) {\n    ai->CastSpell(targetGuid,\
      \ 12345); // Fireball\n} else if (ai->IsInRange(&targetGuid, 12346)) {\n   \
      \ ai->CastSpell(targetGuid, 12346); // Frostbolt\n} else {\n    ai->SetTarget(targetGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI unit's current position and the target's position
    to calculate distance. It uses the spell's range data from the database, which
    may include both minimum and maximum range values. The method does not account
    for line-of-sight or other environmental factors beyond simple distance calculation.
  warnings: Ensure that the target GUID is valid before passing it to this method,
    as invalid pointers or uninitialized values could lead to undefined behavior.
    Also note that this method only evaluates range and does not check if the spell
    is currently usable (e.g., cooldowns, mana requirements).
