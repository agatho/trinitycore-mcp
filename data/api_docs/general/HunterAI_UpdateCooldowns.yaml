  class: HunterAI
  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void HunterAI::UpdateCooldowns(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown tracking for hunter abilities and spells.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown timers for various hunter abilities and spells within the
    AI system. This method is typically called during each AI update cycle to ensure
    that cooldowns are properly tracked and that abilities become available when their
    cooldown periods expire. It handles the logic of decrementing active cooldowns
    and managing the availability state of hunter abilities such as Aimed Shot, Steady
    Shot, and other specialized hunter spells. The method ensures that the hunter
    AI respects game mechanics related to ability usage timing and prevents players
    from spamming abilities before they are ready.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to accurately decrement cooldown timers based on real-time progression.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void HunterAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n\
      \    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    // ... other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom hunter AI behavior
    code: "void MyHunterAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n        // Check if abilities are ready\
      \ and act accordingly\n        if (me->HasSpellCooldown(SPELL_AIMED_SHOT))\n\
      \            // Handle cooldown state\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core AI update loop at regular intervals.
    Developers should ensure that diff values passed are accurate to maintain proper
    cooldown behavior. The method does not directly trigger spell casting but rather
    manages the internal state of when abilities can be used.
  warnings: Incorrect diff values may cause cooldowns to behave erratically, leading
    to abilities becoming available or unavailable at incorrect times. This can result
    in gameplay imbalance or unexpected behavior for players using hunter characters.
