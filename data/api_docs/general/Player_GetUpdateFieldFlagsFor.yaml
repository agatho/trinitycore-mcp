  method: GetUpdateFieldFlagsFor
  signature: int Player::GetUpdateFieldFlagsFor(const Player * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update field flags for a target player, determining visibility
    and interaction behavior in the game world.
  description: This method determines the update field flags that apply to a specific
    player object, which controls how the player's data fields are updated and displayed
    in the game world. It is used primarily for determining what information should
    be visible to other players during updates, particularly in scenarios involving
    player versus player combat or when setting up player interactions. The method
    returns an integer value representing the flags that control field visibility
    and update behavior, which can vary based on player state, faction, and other
    game mechanics. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper game balance
    and ensuring correct data display in various player interaction contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing update field flags that determine
    how the player's data fields are updated and displayed in the game world. The
    value may vary based on player state, faction, and other game mechanics, with
    possible values including 0x1 (Visible), 0x2 (Not visible), or other flag combinations
    depending on the specific player context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int flags = player->GetUpdateFieldFlagsFor(targetPlayer);\nif (flags &\
      \ 0x1)\n{\n    // Player is visible to target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with update system logic and
    requires understanding of the player's state. Implementation details include checking
    player state, faction relationships, and other game mechanics that affect visibility.
    Performance considerations are minimal as this method does not involve complex
    computations.
  warnings: This method should not be called during active combat or when player state
    is changing, as it may return incorrect values if the player's state has changed
    since last update. Avoid calling this method in situations where player data might
    be inconsistent due to rapid state changes.
