  method: AutoAssignQuests
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::AutoAssignQuests(Player * bot, uint32 maxQuests)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically assigns available quests to a player character based on their
    level and quest availability.
  description: The AutoAssignQuests method in the DynamicQuestSystem class automatically
    distributes eligible quests to a specified player character. This function evaluates
    the player's current level, quest completion status, and available quest criteria
    to determine which quests should be assigned. It ensures that players receive
    appropriate quest content without manual intervention, supporting dynamic quest
    progression within the game world. The method respects quest prerequisites and
    limits the number of quests assigned based on the provided maximum count parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character to whom quests
      will be assigned. Must not be null.
  - name: maxQuests
    description: Maximum number of quests to assign to the player. If zero, no quests
      will be assigned. Must be a non-negative integer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Assignment
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;

      questSystem.AutoAssignQuests(player, 5); // Assign up to 5 quests'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assign All Available Quests
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;

      questSystem.AutoAssignQuests(player, UINT32_MAX); // Assign all available quests'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the TrinityCore framework and relies on standard
    quest system mechanics. It is typically used in bot or automated quest progression
    systems where manual quest assignment is not feasible. The function respects existing
    quest assignments and will not duplicate quests already in the player's quest
    log.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer may result in undefined behavior. Be cautious when assigning
    large numbers of quests simultaneously, as this could impact performance or cause
    quest overflow issues.
