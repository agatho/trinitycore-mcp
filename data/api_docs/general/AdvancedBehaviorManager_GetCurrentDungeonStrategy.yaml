  brief: Retrieves the currently active dungeon strategy for the behavior manager
  description: The GetCurrentDungeonStrategy method returns a pointer to the DungeonStrategy
    object that is currently being used by the AdvancedBehaviorManager. This strategy
    defines the behavioral logic and decision-making process for handling dungeon
    encounters. The returned pointer is const, ensuring that the strategy cannot be
    modified through this interface. The method does not perform any validation or
    initialization of the strategy; it simply returns the currently assigned strategy
    object if one exists, or nullptr if no strategy has been set.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the current DungeonStrategy being used by the AdvancedBehaviorManager.
    Returns nullptr if no dungeon strategy is currently active or assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check current dungeon strategy
    code: "const DungeonStrategy* strategy = behaviorManager.GetCurrentDungeonStrategy();\n\
      if (strategy != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the strategy for behavior decisions\n\
      \    strategy->ExecuteStrategy();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no strategy\
      \ is active\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"No dungeon strategy currently active\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides read-only access to the current dungeon strategy. The
    returned pointer remains valid only as long as the AdvancedBehaviorManager maintains
    ownership of the strategy object. If the behavior manager switches strategies,
    subsequent calls will return a different strategy pointer.
