  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the adaptive difficulty system, cleaning up resources and disabling
    dynamic scaling.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the adaptive difficulty system within
    TrinityCore, ensuring all dynamically adjusted difficulty settings are reset and
    any active hooks or listeners are properly removed. This method is typically invoked
    during server shutdown or when the adaptive difficulty feature needs to be temporarily
    disabled. It performs cleanup operations such as releasing allocated memory, unregistering
    event handlers, and resetting internal state variables to their default values.
    The system will no longer adjust mob levels, loot drops, or experience rewards
    based on player count or group composition after this method is called.

  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a safe state to disable
    adaptive difficulty features. It's recommended to call this before server shutdown
    or during maintenance windows to prevent unexpected behavior.
