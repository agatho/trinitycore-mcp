  class: ArenaAI
  method: GetMatchState
  signature: ArenaMatchState ArenaAI::GetMatchState(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current match state of an arena instance.
  description: The GetMatchState method returns the ArenaMatchState enum value that
    represents the current phase or status of an arena match. This includes states
    such as waiting for players, in progress, or finished. The method is typically
    used by AI systems to determine how to behave during different phases of an arena
    battle. It may also provide a pointer to a player's data if needed for state-specific
    logic. The returned value helps control AI behavior and decision-making throughout
    the match lifecycle.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Optional pointer to an integer that can be used to retrieve specific
      player-related information within the arena match state. If provided, this parameter
      allows the method to return player-specific data or update the referenced value
      with relevant player state information.
  returns: Returns an ArenaMatchState enum value indicating the current state of the
    arena match. Possible values may include ARENA_STATE_WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS, ARENA_STATE_IN_PROGRESS,
    ARENA_STATE_FINISHED, etc., depending on the implementation and game version.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check arena match state
    code: "ArenaMatchState state = arenaAI->GetMatchState();\nswitch (state)\n{\n\
      \    case ARENA_STATE_WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS:\n        // Handle waiting logic\n\
      \        break;\n    case ARENA_STATE_IN_PROGRESS:\n        // Handle active\
      \ combat logic\n        break;\n    case ARENA_STATE_FINISHED:\n        // Handle\
      \ end of match logic\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using player parameter to get specific player data
    code: "int playerId = 0;\nArenaMatchState state = arenaAI->GetMatchState(&playerId);\n\
      if (state == ARENA_STATE_IN_PROGRESS)\n{\n    // Use playerId for targeted AI\
      \ behavior\n    // Example: adjust tactics based on player's current health\
      \ or position\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ArenaAI class and is designed to be called from
    within arena match contexts. The implementation may vary depending on the specific
    version of TrinityCore and the type of arena being played (2v2, 3v3, or 5v5).
    Ensure that the ArenaAI instance is properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active arena match context may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect state values. The player parameter should be
    initialized to a valid integer value before being passed, as it might be modified
    by the function depending on implementation details.
