  signature: void AreaTrigger::UpdateShape()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the shape and positioning of the area trigger in the world.
  description: The UpdateShape method is responsible for recalculating and applying
    any changes to the geometric representation and spatial properties of an AreaTrigger
    object. This includes updating its position, orientation, scale, and collision
    boundaries based on current game state or configuration parameters. The method
    ensures that the area trigger's visual and functional shape accurately reflects
    its intended design within the game world, which is crucial for proper interaction
    with players and other game entities. It typically gets invoked during frame updates
    or when the area trigger's properties are modified dynamically.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in update loop
    code: "void Update()\n{\n    // Update area trigger shape based on current state\n\
      \    areaTrigger->UpdateShape();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating shape after property change
    code: "void SetNewScale(float newScale)\n{\n    m_scale = newScale;\n    // Reapply\
      \ updated shape to reflect new scale\n    UpdateShape();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve recalculating collision detection boundaries and
    updating the visual representation of the area trigger. It's typically called
    from within the main game loop or during state transitions, so performance considerations
    should be taken into account for frequently updated triggers.
  warnings: Calling UpdateShape() manually without proper context might lead to inconsistent
    state between visual representation and actual collision behavior. Ensure that
    all relevant properties are properly set before invoking this method.
