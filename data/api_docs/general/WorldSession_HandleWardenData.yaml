  brief: Processes incoming Warden data packets from the client for anti-cheat validation
  description: The HandleWardenData method is responsible for processing Warden data
    received from a connected client. Warden is Blizzard's anti-cheat system used
    in World of Warcraft to detect cheating software and unauthorized modifications.
    This method handles the cryptographic handshake and validation process between
    the server and client's Warden module, ensuring that the client is running legitimate
    game code without tampering. The method typically receives encrypted data from
    the client which must be decrypted and validated against expected responses before
    allowing further communication or potentially flagging the client for cheating.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleWardenData(WorldPackets::Warden::WardenData& packet)\n\
      {\n    // Process Warden data from client\n    _warden->HandleClientResponse(packet);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the security infrastructure and should not be modified
    without understanding the full Warden protocol. The method typically operates
    in a synchronous context within the session's packet handling flow, and may block
    client communication until processing completes.
  warnings: Modifying or bypassing this method can compromise server security and
    lead to unauthorized access. This method is critical for maintaining game integrity
    and should only be handled by developers with deep understanding of anti-cheat
    systems.
