  signature: int MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::GetKitePosition(int * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal kite position for a Marksmanship Hunter
    based on target distance and combat conditions.
  description: The GetKitePosition method determines the ideal positioning strategy
    for a Marksmanship Hunter to maintain optimal distance from enemies while maximizing
    damage output. This method evaluates factors such as enemy range, hunter's attack
    speed, and available abilities to compute a recommended position that balances
    safety with damage efficiency. The returned value typically represents a normalized
    position indicator (e.g., 0 = too close, 1 = optimal, 2 = too far) which can be
    used by the AI system to adjust movement behavior during combat. This method is
    crucial for implementing proper hunter kite mechanics in TrinityCore's AI framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer representing the recommended kite position: 0 indicates
    the hunter should move closer to the target, 1 indicates optimal positioning,
    and 2 indicates the hunter should move farther away from the target. Negative
    values may indicate error conditions or invalid states.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "int kitePosition = hunter.GetKitePosition();\nswitch (kitePosition) {\n\
      \    case 0:\n        // Move closer to target\n        break;\n    case 1:\n\
      \        // Maintain current position\n        break;\n    case 2:\n       \
      \ // Move away from target\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Logic
    code: "if (hunter.GetKitePosition() == 2) {\n    // Execute retreat movement\n\
      \    hunter.MoveAwayFromTarget();\n} else if (hunter.GetKitePosition() == 0)\
      \ {\n    // Execute approach movement\n    hunter.MoveTowardsTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Marksmanship Hunter's AI behavior system and assumes
    that the hunter has valid target information. The implementation likely considers
    factors such as weapon range, global cooldowns, and ability availability when
    calculating position. For accurate results, this method should be called during
    active combat scenarios where target positioning is critical.
  warnings: This method may return unexpected values if called outside of combat or
    without a valid target. Always validate the return value before using it for movement
    decisions. The exact calculation logic is implementation-specific and may vary
    between different versions of TrinityCore's AI system.
