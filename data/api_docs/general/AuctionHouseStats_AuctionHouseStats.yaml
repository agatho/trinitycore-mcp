  brief: Initializes the auction house statistics tracking system
  description: The AuctionHouseStats constructor initializes internal data structures
    used to track and manage auction house activity statistics. This method sets up
    tracking for various auction metrics including item sales, bids placed, and revenue
    generated. The initialization process ensures that all statistical counters are
    properly reset and ready for data collection. This constructor is typically called
    during server startup or when a new auction house instance is created.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'AuctionHouseStats stats;

      // Constructor automatically initializes all tracking systems'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs no operations beyond initialization. The actual auction
    statistics collection occurs through other methods in the class. The constructor
    is designed to be lightweight and should not block server startup.
