  brief: Clears the changes mask for the active player, resetting all tracked field
    modifications.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of an
    ActivePlayerUnk901 object, effectively clearing any previously tracked modifications
    to player fields. This is typically used during synchronization processes or when
    preparing to send updates to the client, ensuring that only relevant field changes
    are included in subsequent network packets. The method does not take any parameters
    and has no return value. It's commonly called before applying new updates or when
    resetting state for a player's data transmission.

  notes: This method is part of the internal player state management system in TrinityCore.
    It's typically invoked during packet preparation or synchronization phases to
    ensure clean state before new changes are applied.
