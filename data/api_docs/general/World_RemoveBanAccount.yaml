  method: RemoveBanAccount
  signature: bool World::RemoveBanAccount(int mode, const std::string & nameOrIP)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a ban from an account based on the specified mode and identifier.
  description: The RemoveBanAccount method is used to lift a previously applied ban
    from an account in the World of Warcraft server. It accepts a mode parameter that
    determines how the ban is identified (e.g., by account name or IP address) and
    a string identifier that specifies which account or IP to unban. This function
    interacts with the database to update the ban status, effectively allowing the
    previously banned account or IP to reconnect to the game. The method returns true
    if the operation was successful and false otherwise, indicating either that no
    matching ban existed or an error occurred during the process.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: An integer value specifying the type of identifier used for the ban
      removal. Common values include 1 for account name and 2 for IP address.
  - name: nameOrIP
    description: A string containing either the account name or IP address to remove
      the ban from, depending on the mode specified.
  returns: Returns true if the ban was successfully removed from the database; returns
    false if no matching ban record exists or an error occurred during the operation.
  examples:
  - title: Remove account ban by name
    code: "if (sWorld->RemoveBanAccount(1, \"PlayerAccount\")) {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Successfully unbanned account: PlayerAccount\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to unban account: PlayerAccount\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove IP ban
    code: "if (sWorld->RemoveBanAccount(2, \"192.168.1.100\")) {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Successfully unbanned IP: 192.168.1.100\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to unban IP: 192.168.1.100\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the database and should be used carefully
    in high-concurrency environments. It is typically called from administrative commands
    or console interfaces where server operators manage user access.
  warnings: Ensure that the mode parameter correctly corresponds to the type of identifier
    being passed, as incorrect modes may result in failed operations or unintended
    behavior. Also, verify that the account or IP exists before attempting removal
    to avoid unnecessary database queries.
