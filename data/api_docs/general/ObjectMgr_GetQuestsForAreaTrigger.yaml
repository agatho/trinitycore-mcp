  signature: const int * ObjectMgr::GetQuestsForAreaTrigger(uint32 Trigger_ID) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of quest IDs associated with a specified area trigger.
  description: The GetQuestsForAreaTrigger method returns a constant pointer to an
    array of integers representing the quest identifiers linked to a given area trigger
    ID. This functionality is essential for determining which quests are activated
    or relevant when a player interacts with a specific area trigger, such as stepping
    into a quest-giving zone or triggering a quest-related event. The method accesses
    internal data structures maintained by the ObjectMgr class that map area triggers
    to their associated quests. It's commonly used in quest handling systems and area
    trigger logic within TrinityCore's core mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers (int*) where each integer represents
    a quest ID associated with the specified area trigger. Returns nullptr if no quests
    are found for the given trigger ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const int* questList = sObjectMgr->GetQuestsForAreaTrigger(12345);\nif\
      \ (questList != nullptr) {\n    for (int i = 0; questList[i] != 0; ++i) {\n\
      \        printf(\"Quest ID: %d\\n\", questList[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is null-terminated, meaning the last element will be 0
    to indicate the end of the list. The method assumes that area trigger to quest
    mappings are pre-loaded and indexed within the ObjectMgr's internal data structures.
    This method should only be called after the game world has been initialized and
    all quest data has been loaded.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve lookups in internal data structures. The returned pointer is only
    valid while the ObjectMgr instance remains alive and its data structures are not
    modified. Do not attempt to modify the contents of the returned array.
