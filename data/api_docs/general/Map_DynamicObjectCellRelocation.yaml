  method: DynamicObjectCellRelocation
  signature: bool Map::DynamicObjectCellRelocation(int * go, int new_cell)
documentation:
  brief: Relocates a dynamic object to a new cell within the map.
  description: The DynamicObjectCellRelocation method is responsible for updating
    the cell position of a dynamic object within the TrinityCore world map system.
    This method ensures that objects such as area triggers, spell effects, or other
    dynamic entities are properly tracked and managed across different map cells.
    It handles the internal bookkeeping required to maintain spatial awareness of
    these objects, which is crucial for proper visibility, collision detection, and
    event triggering. The method typically gets invoked when an object moves from
    one cell to another during gameplay, ensuring that the server's spatial indexing
    remains consistent with the object's actual position.
  parameters:
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the dynamic object identifier (GUID) that needs to be
      relocated. This parameter represents the unique identifier of the object being
      moved.
  - name: new_cell
    description: The new cell coordinate where the dynamic object should be relocated.
      This value typically represents a cell index or coordinate within the map's
      grid system.
  returns: Returns true if the relocation was successful and the object's cell position
    was updated correctly; otherwise, returns false if the operation failed due to
    invalid parameters or internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dynamic Object Relocation
    code: "uint64 guid = 12345;\nint newCell = 50;\nbool success = map->DynamicObjectCellRelocation(&guid,\
      \ newCell);\nif (success) {\n    // Object successfully relocated\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Relocation with Error Checking
    code: "uint64 guid = player->GetGUID();\nint newCell = CalculateNewCellPosition(player);\n\
      if (newCell >= 0) {\n    bool result = map->DynamicObjectCellRelocation(&guid,\
      \ newCell);\n    if (!result) {\n        // Log error or handle relocation failure\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Failed to relocate dynamic object %u\", guid);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal map management system and should generally
    not be called directly by external modules. The implementation likely involves
    updating internal data structures such as spatial hash tables or grid-based indexing
    systems to reflect the new object position. It's important to ensure that the
    new cell coordinate is valid and within the bounds of the map's grid before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (such as a null pointer for
    'go' or an out-of-bounds 'new_cell') can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    The method assumes that the object exists and is already registered in the map's
    dynamic object system. Improper usage may cause synchronization issues between
    client and server views of object positions.
