  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: GetDynamicObjectsInArea
  signature: int DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GetDynamicObjectsInArea(const int & center,
    float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of dynamic objects within a specified radius around a
    given center point in the spatial grid.
  description: The GetDynamicObjectsInArea method searches through the double-buffered
    spatial grid structure to find all dynamic objects located within a circular area
    defined by a center point and a radius. This method is commonly used for spatial
    queries in game systems such as area-of-effect spell targeting, loot distribution,
    or NPC behavior triggering. The method operates on a grid-based spatial partitioning
    system that efficiently organizes objects for fast retrieval. It returns the number
    of dynamic objects found within the specified area, which can be zero if no objects
    are present. The center parameter typically represents a coordinate in the game
    world, and the radius defines the search distance from that point.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the search area, represented as an integer identifier
      (likely a grid cell index or world coordinate). This value determines where
      the circular search begins.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular area to search for dynamic objects. Must
      be a positive floating-point number representing distance in game units.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of dynamic objects found within
    the specified area. A return value of zero indicates no dynamic objects were found,
    while any positive integer indicates the number of objects present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Count Dynamic Objects
    code: "int objectCount = grid.GetDynamicObjectsInArea(100, 5.0f);\nif (objectCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Process the dynamic objects found\n    printf(\"Found %d dynamic\
      \ objects in area\\n\", objectCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with World Coordinates for Area Search
    code: "const int centerPoint = 500; // Example grid cell index\nconst float searchRadius\
      \ = 10.0f;\nint count = grid.GetDynamicObjectsInArea(centerPoint, searchRadius);\n\
      if (count >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with logic based on found objects\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Dynamic objects in area: \" << count << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is optimized for performance using a double-buffered spatial
    grid system, which allows for efficient concurrent access and updates. The implementation
    assumes that the center parameter refers to a valid grid cell or coordinate within
    the spatial partitioning structure. The radius value should be carefully chosen
    to avoid excessive memory allocations or performance degradation in large worlds.
  warnings: Ensure that the center parameter is within valid bounds of the spatial
    grid, otherwise behavior may be undefined. Be cautious when using very large radius
    values as they can result in high computational overhead due to scanning many
    grid cells. The method does not return actual object references; it only provides
    a count for further processing.
