  method: GetSpellCastItem
  signature: Item * TradeData::GetSpellCastItem() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the item associated with a spell cast during a trade.
  description: The GetSpellCastItem method retrieves the Item object that is being
    used in a spell cast operation within the context of a trade. This method is typically
    invoked when processing trade operations where a player is casting a spell on
    an item, such as enchanting or applying a gem. The returned item pointer can be
    null if no spell-cast item is currently associated with the trade data. This method
    provides access to the underlying item object for further manipulation or validation
    during trade processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Item object that represents the spell cast item in the
    trade, or nullptr if no such item exists.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spell Cast Item from Trade Data
    code: "TradeData* tradeData = player->GetTradeData();\nItem* spellCastItem = tradeData->GetSpellCastItem();\n\
      if (spellCastItem)\n{\n    // Process the spell cast item\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Spell cast item found: %u\", spellCastItem->GetEntry());\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      No spell cast item in trade.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of trade operations and spell
    casting mechanics. The returned Item pointer should not be deleted or modified
    directly as it's managed by the trade system. Ensure that the TradeData object
    is valid before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or uninitialized TradeData object may
    result in undefined behavior. Always verify that the trade data contains valid
    information before accessing the spell cast item.
