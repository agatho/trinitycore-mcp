  signature: void BotCharacterDistribution::LoadRaceClassDistribution()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the race and class distribution data for bot characters
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The LoadRaceClassDistribution method is responsible for loading predefined
    race and class distributions that determine how bot characters are assigned to
    different races and classes when they are created. This method typically reads
    configuration data or database entries that define the probabilities or constraints
    for bot character creation. It ensures that bots are distributed according to
    specified rules, which may be used for balancing gameplay, testing, or simulating
    player populations. The method is generally called during server initialization
    or when the distribution settings need to be refreshed.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution distribution;

      distribution.LoadRaceClassDistribution();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures or configuration
    files to populate distribution tables. It should be called before any bot character
    creation logic that depends on race and class distributions.
