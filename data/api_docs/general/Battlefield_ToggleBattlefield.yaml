  method: ToggleBattlefield
  signature: void Battlefield::ToggleBattlefield(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the battlefield instance for player participation.
  description: The ToggleBattlefield method controls whether a Battlefield instance
    is active and accepting players. When enabled, the battlefield becomes available
    for players to join and participate in combat. When disabled, it prevents new
    players from entering and may remove existing participants. This method is typically
    used during battlefield lifecycle management such as starting or ending a battle,
    or when transitioning between different phases of the battlefield event.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag that determines the state of the battlefield. If true,
      enables the battlefield for player participation; if false, disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Battlefield
    code: 'Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);

      bf->ToggleBattlefield(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Battlefield
    code: 'Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);

      bf->ToggleBattlefield(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal state changes that affect player movement,
    combat eligibility, and quest status updates. It should be called with appropriate
    synchronization to avoid race conditions during battlefield transitions.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in inconsistent
    battlefield states or unexpected behavior for players already inside the battlefield.
    Ensure the battlefield is in a valid state before toggling its enabled status.
