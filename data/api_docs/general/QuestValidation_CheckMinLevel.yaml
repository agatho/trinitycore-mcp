documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets the minimum level requirement for a quest
  description: The CheckMinLevel method validates whether a given player has reached
    the minimum required level to accept and progress through a specific quest. This
    validation is crucial in World of Warcraft's quest system to ensure players cannot
    access quests that are too difficult for their current character level. The method
    compares the player's current level against the quest's minimum level requirement,
    returning true if the player meets or exceeds the threshold, and false otherwise.
    This check is typically performed during quest acceptance, gossip interactions,
    and quest progress validation.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that contains the minimum level requirement
      to be validated against
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose level will be checked against
      the quest's minimum level requirement
  returns: Returns true if the player's level meets or exceeds the quest's minimum
    level requirement, false otherwise. A return value of false typically prevents
    the player from accepting or progressing with the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Level Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::CheckMinLevel(quest, player)) {\n    // Player can\
      \ accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    // Player cannot\
      \ accept the quest due to level requirements\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You are not high enough level to take this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Gossip System
    code: "void Player::OnGossipHello(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (QuestValidation::CheckMinLevel(quest,\
      \ this)) {\n        // Show quest details and allow acceptance\n        AddGossipItemFor(0,\
      \ \"Accept Quest\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 1);\n    } else {\n        // Hide quest\
      \ from gossip menu\n        SendGossipMenu(907, GetGUID()); // Generic 'too\
      \ low level' text\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's quest validation system and directly
    impacts gameplay progression. The minimum level check is a fundamental requirement
    in World of Warcraft's quest design to maintain game balance and player progression
    flow. Implementation uses internal quest data structures and player level information,
    making it efficient for frequent checks during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that both the quest and player parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as dereferencing null pointers will cause crashes. The method
    does not perform any automatic UI notifications or error messages - it only returns
    a boolean result for use in higher-level validation logic.
