  method: IsServerSide
  signature: bool AreaTrigger::IsServerSide() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the area trigger is managed by the server-side logic.
  description: The IsServerSide method checks if the area trigger is handled entirely
    on the server side, meaning it does not rely on client-side rendering or execution.
    This is typically used to differentiate between server-managed triggers (such
    as those used for game mechanics, quest events, or spell effects) and client-side
    visual effects. The method returns true when the area trigger is purely server-side,
    and false otherwise. This flag is crucial for determining how the area trigger
    interacts with the game world state and player actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the area trigger is managed
    by server-side logic. True means the trigger operates entirely on the server,
    while false indicates it may involve client-side components or be purely visual.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Area Trigger is Server-Side
    code: "if (areaTrigger->IsServerSide()) {\n    // Handle server-side logic for\
      \ area trigger\n    areaTrigger->HandleServerSideEffect();\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle client-side or mixed logic\n    areaTrigger->HandleClientSideEffect();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other area trigger management
    functions to ensure proper handling of game events. The server-side flag affects
    how the trigger interacts with player movement, spell casting, and quest progression.
