  class: VendorInteractionManager
  method: FindVendorItem
  signature: const VendorItem * VendorInteractionManager::FindVendorItem(Creature
    * vendor, uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a vendor item entry for a given item ID from the specified
    vendor's inventory.
  description: The FindVendorItem method searches through the inventory of a given
    Creature vendor to locate a specific item by its unique identifier. It returns
    a pointer to the VendorItem structure that represents the item in the vendor's
    catalog, or nullptr if no matching item is found. This method is commonly used
    during vendor interactions to verify item availability, check pricing, or determine
    if an item can be purchased from a particular NPC. The method performs a lookup
    within the vendor's item list and does not modify any data. It assumes that the
    vendor parameter points to a valid Creature object with a populated vendor item
    list.
  parameters:
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor whose inventory
      will be searched. Must not be null.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to search for within the vendor's
      inventory. Must be a valid item ID from the game database.
  returns: A pointer to a const VendorItem structure representing the found item in
    the vendor's catalog, or nullptr if no matching item is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if an item exists in vendor inventory
    code: "Creature* vendor = ...; // obtained from some source\nuint32 itemId = 12345;\n\
      const VendorItem* item = VendorInteractionManager::FindVendorItem(vendor, itemId);\n\
      if (item != nullptr)\n{\n    // Item found in vendor's inventory\n    printf(\"\
      Item %u is available for purchase\\n\", itemId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Item not\
      \ found\n    printf(\"Item %u is not available from this vendor\\n\", itemId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the returned VendorItem to access item properties
    code: "Creature* vendor = ...;\nuint32 itemId = 12345;\nconst VendorItem* item\
      \ = VendorInteractionManager::FindVendorItem(vendor, itemId);\nif (item != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Access item properties\n    uint32 itemPrice = item->item->BuyPrice;\n\
      \    uint32 maxCount = item->maxcount;\n    printf(\"Item price: %u, Max count:\
      \ %u\\n\", itemPrice, maxCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a linear search through the vendor's item list. For vendors
    with many items, this may have performance implications. The method does not perform
    any validation on the vendor pointer or item ID beyond basic null checks. It is
    recommended to ensure that the vendor object has been properly initialized and
    contains valid vendor data before calling this method.
  warnings: This method returns a const pointer, meaning the returned VendorItem structure
    should not be modified. If the vendor's item list changes during runtime (e.g.,
    through dynamic updates), the returned pointer may become invalid. Always verify
    that the vendor object is valid and contains items before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior.
