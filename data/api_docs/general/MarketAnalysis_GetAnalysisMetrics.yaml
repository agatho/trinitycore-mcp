  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: GetAnalysisMetrics
  signature: const AnalysisMetrics & MarketAnalysis::GetAnalysisMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the analysis metrics object containing market
    data statistics.
  description: The GetAnalysisMetrics method provides access to the complete set of
    market analysis metrics collected by the MarketAnalysis class. This method returns
    a const reference to an AnalysisMetrics object, which encapsulates various statistical
    data points related to market trends, pricing information, and trading activity.
    The returned reference ensures that the caller cannot modify the internal state
    of the metrics object, maintaining data integrity. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with market monitoring systems or reporting modules where up-to-date
    market statistics are required without altering the underlying data structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an AnalysisMetrics object containing all collected
    market analysis data including statistical summaries, trend indicators, and pricing
    metrics. The reference remains valid for the lifetime of the MarketAnalysis instance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Market Analysis Metrics
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      const AnalysisMetrics& metrics = analysis.GetAnalysisMetrics();

      uint32 averagePrice = metrics.GetAveragePrice();

      uint32 itemCount = metrics.GetItemTotalCount();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Metrics in Market Reporting
    code: "void ReportMarketTrends(MarketAnalysis& analysis) {\n    const AnalysisMetrics&\
      \ metrics = analysis.GetAnalysisMetrics();\n    std::cout << \"Average Item\
      \ Price: \" << metrics.GetAveragePrice() << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"\
      Total Items Traded: \" << metrics.GetItemTotalCount() << std::endl;\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Market Volatility Index: \" << metrics.GetVolatilityIndex() << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned AnalysisMetrics reference is guaranteed to be valid only as
    long as the MarketAnalysis object exists. This method does not perform any computation
    or data processing; it simply returns a cached reference to pre-computed metrics.
    The method is thread-safe if the underlying MarketAnalysis instance is properly
    synchronized by the calling code.
  warnings: Ensure that the MarketAnalysis instance remains valid for the duration
    of using the returned reference, as accessing the reference after the parent object
    has been destroyed results in undefined behavior. This method should not be used
    to modify metrics data, as it returns a const reference.
