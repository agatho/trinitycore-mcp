documentation:
  brief: Returns a bitmask indicating which effects of the aura are currently applied
    to the target.
  description: The GetEffectsToApply method retrieves a uint32 bitmask that represents
    which of the aura's effects are actively being applied to the target unit. Each
    bit in the mask corresponds to a specific aura effect index, allowing systems
    to determine exactly which effects are active and influencing the unit. This is
    commonly used during aura application and removal logic, as well as for determining
    what effects should be processed or displayed. The returned value can be used
    in conjunction with bit manipulation operations to check individual effect states.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 bitmask where each set bit indicates that the corresponding aura
    effect (indexed by bit position) is currently applied to the target. Bit 0 represents
    effect 0, bit 1 represents effect 1, and so on up to bit 31.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a specific aura effect is active
    code: "AuraApplication* app = unit->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (app)\n{\n\
      \    uint32 effects = app->GetEffectsToApply();\n    if (effects & (1u << 2))\
      \ // Check if effect 2 is active\n    {\n        // Effect 2 is currently applied\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The bitmask returned by this method reflects the current state of aura application
    and may change dynamically as the aura's duration, stacking, or other conditions
    evolve. This value should not be cached for extended periods without checking
    for updates.
