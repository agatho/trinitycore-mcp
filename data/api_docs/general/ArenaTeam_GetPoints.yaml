api:
  class: ArenaTeam
  method: GetPoints
  signature: uint32 ArenaTeam::GetPoints(uint32 MemberRating)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the points awarded to an arena team member based on
    their rating.
  description: The GetPoints method computes the number of points a player should
    receive for their performance in an arena match, using their current rating as
    input. This calculation is integral to the arena system's ranking and reward mechanism,
    determining how many points are added or subtracted from a player's personal rating
    after a match. The method likely takes into account factors such as the opponent's
    rating, match outcome, and team composition to determine point adjustments. It
    serves as a core component in maintaining the competitive balance and progression
    within arena environments.
  parameters:
  - name: MemberRating
    description: The current rating of the arena team member whose points are being
      calculated. This value typically represents the player's standing in the arena
      ladder system.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated points that should be
    awarded to the arena team member based on their rating and match performance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 playerRating = 1800;

      uint32 pointsEarned = arenaTeam->GetPoints(playerRating);

      // pointsEarned now contains the calculated points for a player with rating
      1800'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Match Result Processing
    code: "void ProcessArenaMatchResult(ArenaTeam* team, uint32 playerRating)\n{\n\
      \    uint32 points = team->GetPoints(playerRating);\n    // Apply points to\
      \ player's rating\n    // Update team statistics\n    // Log match results\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the arena system when processing
    match outcomes. The actual point calculation algorithm may be based on Elo rating
    system principles or similar competitive balance mechanisms. Developers should
    note that this method might not directly modify player ratings but rather computes
    values needed for such modifications.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it takes a parameter, but the provided documentation
    states 'None' as parameters. This discrepancy should be resolved by verifying
    the actual API definition. Also, ensure proper handling of edge cases like very
    low or extremely high ratings that might affect point calculations.
