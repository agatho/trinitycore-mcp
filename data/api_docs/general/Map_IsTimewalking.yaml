  class: Map
  method: IsTimewalking
  signature: bool Map::IsTimewalking() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is in a timewalking instance.
  description: This method checks if the map instance is currently operating within
    a timewalking context, which is a special game mode where players can experience
    events and content that would normally be unavailable. The method returns true
    when the map is in a timewalking state, indicating that time-based mechanics are
    active and potentially affecting gameplay. This functionality is crucial for determining
    if certain content or events should be accessible or restricted based on the current
    timewalking status of the map.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is currently in a timewalking instance, false otherwise.
    The method may return false when the map is not in a timewalking context or when
    the timewalking state has been disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (map->IsTimewalking())\n{\n    // Handle timewalking content\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Normal gameplay\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other time-based mechanics
    to determine if special events or content should be enabled. It may be called
    frequently during gameplay to check current timewalking status.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player can access certain
    content without checking the specific timewalking conditions, as it only indicates
    whether the map itself is in a timewalking state.
