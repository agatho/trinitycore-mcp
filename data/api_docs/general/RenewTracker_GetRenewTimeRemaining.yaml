  class: RenewTracker
  method: GetRenewTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 RenewTracker::GetRenewTimeRemaining(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the remaining time in milliseconds for a specified player's renew
    effect.
  description: The GetRenewTimeRemaining method is used to determine how much time
    remains on a player's renew effect, which typically represents a healing-over-time
    buff that periodically restores health. This method takes a player's unique identifier
    (GUID) as input and returns the duration in milliseconds left before the renew
    effect expires. The method is commonly used in combat systems and spell tracking
    to manage active buffs and determine when effects should be refreshed or removed.
    It is important to note that this method only applies to players who currently
    have an active renew effect on their character.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose renew time remaining
      is being queried. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from the game
      world.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the time in milliseconds remaining
    on the specified player's renew effect. If the player does not have an active
    renew effect, this method may return 0 or throw an exception depending on implementation
    details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 remainingTime = renewTracker.GetRenewTimeRemaining(playerGuid);\n\
      if (remainingTime > 0)\n{\n    // Player has active renew effect\n    printf(\"\
      Renew effect expires in %u milliseconds\\n\", remainingTime);\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // No active renew effect\n    printf(\"No active renew effect found for\
      \ player.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Management
    code: "void UpdateRenewEffect(Player* player)\n{\n    uint32 guid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    uint32 timeRemaining = renewTracker.GetRenewTimeRemaining(guid);\n    \n\
      \    if (timeRemaining <= 5000) // Less than 5 seconds remaining\n    {\n  \
      \      // Refresh or reapply the renew effect\n        ApplyRenewEffect(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the RenewTracker maintains an internal mapping of
    player GUIDs to their respective renew effect timers. The implementation should
    handle cases where a player GUID is not found in the tracker, potentially returning
    0 or throwing an exception. Performance-wise, this method should be efficient
    as it likely uses a hash map or similar data structure for O(1) lookup times.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid player object before
    calling this method. Passing invalid or non-player GUIDs may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. Additionally, be aware that the returned time is
    in milliseconds and should be converted appropriately for display purposes.
