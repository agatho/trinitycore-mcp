documentation:
  brief: Gracefully terminates all active bot sessions managed by the session manager
  description: The Shutdown method initiates a controlled shutdown sequence for all
    bot sessions currently managed by the IBotSessionManager instance. This method
    ensures that all active bot connections are properly closed, resources are released,
    and any pending operations are completed before termination. The shutdown process
    typically involves notifying each bot session to clean up its state, disconnecting
    from the game server, and freeing associated memory and system resources. This
    method should only be called when the application is intended to exit or when
    a complete reset of the bot system is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: "IBotSessionManager* sessionManager = GetBotSessionManager();\nif (sessionManager)\n\
      {\n    sessionManager->Shutdown();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during application teardown or system shutdown.
    It's important to ensure no other threads are actively using the session manager
    before calling Shutdown, as it may block until all sessions are properly terminated.
    The method does not return until all shutdown operations are complete.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while bot sessions are actively processing commands or
    in the middle of complex operations may result in data loss or inconsistent states.
    It's recommended to pause or finalize all active bot activities before invoking
    this method.
