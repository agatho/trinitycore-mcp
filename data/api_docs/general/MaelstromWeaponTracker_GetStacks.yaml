  class: MaelstromWeaponTracker
  method: GetStacks
  signature: uint32 MaelstromWeaponTracker::GetStacks() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of the Maelstrom weapon buff.
  description: The GetStacks method returns the number of active stacks of the Maelstrom
    weapon buff currently applied to the player. This buff is associated with the
    Enhancement shaman's Maelstrom talent, which accumulates charges from certain
    abilities like Lava Burst and Chain Lightning. Each stack contributes to increasing
    the damage of subsequent attacks. The method provides access to the internal stack
    counter managed by the MaelstromWeaponTracker class, allowing other systems to
    query the current buff state for gameplay logic or UI display purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of active Maelstrom weapon stacks.
    Returns 0 if no stacks are currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Buff Stacks
    code: "uint32 stacks = player->GetMaelstromWeaponTracker()->GetStacks();\nif (stacks\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Apply Maelstrom-based effects\n    SendChatMessage(\"Maelstrom\
      \ stacks: \" + std::to_string(stacks));\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Stacks for Damage Calculation
    code: 'uint32 stacks = player->GetMaelstromWeaponTracker()->GetStacks();

      float damageMultiplier = 1.0f + (stacks * 0.1f); // 10% per stack

      uint32 finalDamage = baseDamage * damageMultiplier;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other Maelstrom-related
    systems to determine the effectiveness of abilities that consume or generate stacks.
    The returned value reflects the current state at the time of the call and may
    change immediately after the method returns due to ongoing gameplay events.
  warnings: Be aware that calling this method during combat or ability execution might
    return a stale value if the stack count changes in the same game tick. For real-time
    updates, consider using event-based notifications instead of polling.
