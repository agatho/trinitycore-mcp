documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InterruptCoordinatorFixed instance and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the interrupt
    coordinator. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an instance
    of InterruptCoordinatorFixed goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the
    context of TrinityCore's AI and combat system, this class likely manages interruptible
    actions such as spell casting or ability usage, and its destructor guarantees
    that all pending interrupts are properly cleared and any associated callbacks
    or handlers are safely removed. The destructor does not take any parameters and
    performs no explicit return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Destruction of InterruptCoordinatorFixed Instance
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed* coordinator = new InterruptCoordinatorFixed();

      // ... use the coordinator ...

      delete coordinator; // Triggers ~InterruptCoordinatorFixed()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is deleted. It's important to ensure that no other objects hold references
    to this instance after deletion to prevent dangling pointer issues. The implementation
    should be noexcept to avoid exceptions during stack unwinding.
