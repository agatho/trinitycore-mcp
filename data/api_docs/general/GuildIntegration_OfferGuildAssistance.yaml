  signature: void GuildIntegration::OfferGuildAssistance(int * player, const std::string
    & assistance)
documentation:
  brief: Offers guild assistance to a player using specified assistance type
  description: The OfferGuildAssistance method provides a mechanism for guild members
    to offer support or resources to other players within the same guild. This method
    takes a pointer to a player object and an assistance type string, which determines
    the kind of help being offered. The implementation likely handles communication
    between players and guild systems, potentially triggering in-game notifications
    or updating guild member status. It's designed to facilitate cooperative gameplay
    mechanics where guild members can assist each other with various in-game activities
    or challenges.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object receiving the assistance offer. Must
      be a valid player instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: assistance
    description: String identifier specifying the type of assistance being offered.
      Valid values may include 'heal', 'mana', 'repair', or other game-specific assistance
      types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Assistance Offer
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get player reference

      std::string assistType = "heal";

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.OfferGuildAssistance(&targetPlayer, assistType);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Offering Different Types of Assistance
    code: 'Player* player1 = ...;

      Player* player2 = ...;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.OfferGuildAssistance(&player1, "repair");

      guildInt.OfferGuildAssistance(&player2, "mana");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's guild subsystem and may
    trigger in-game communication systems. The player pointer should be validated
    before calling to prevent null reference issues. Implementation details may vary
    based on specific TrinityCore version and patch.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid player pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the assistance string contains valid, supported values to avoid silent
    failures or incorrect game mechanics.
