  class: KitingManager
  method: GenerateLineWaypoints
  signature: int KitingManager::GenerateLineWaypoints(const int & start, const int
    & direction, float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a series of waypoints along a straight line from a starting point
    in a specified direction for kiting movement patterns.
  description: The GenerateLineWaypoints method calculates and stores a sequence of
    navigation waypoints that form a straight line path originating from a given start
    position and extending in a defined direction for a specified distance. This functionality
    is primarily used in kiting behavior AI to create predictable movement patterns
    for NPCs or player-controlled units, enabling them to maintain optimal positioning
    while engaging targets. The method likely interacts with the underlying navigation
    system to ensure generated waypoints are valid for movement within the game world.
    It returns an integer indicating success or failure of waypoint generation, which
    may be used by calling code to determine if further processing is required.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting index or identifier of the waypoint from which the line
      path begins. This typically represents a node in the navigation mesh or a specific
      location in the AI's movement system.
  - name: direction
    description: The direction vector or angle (in degrees) indicating the orientation
      of the line path. This determines the trajectory along which waypoints will
      be generated from the starting point.
  - name: distance
    description: The total distance in game units that the generated waypoint line
      should extend from the start position. This parameter controls how far the kiting
      pattern extends.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the waypoint
    generation process. A positive value typically indicates successful generation,
    while a negative value may indicate errors such as invalid parameters or insufficient
    navigation data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Kiting AI
    code: "int result = kitingManager.GenerateLineWaypoints(10, 45.0f, 20.0f);\nif\
      \ (result > 0) {\n    // Waypoints successfully generated\n    // Proceed with\
      \ movement logic\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Generated Waypoints for NPC Movement
    code: "KitingManager kitingManager;\nint startNode = 50;\nfloat directionAngle\
      \ = 90.0f; // Moving east\nfloat distance = 30.0f;\n\nint waypointCount = kitingManager.GenerateLineWaypoints(startNode,\
      \ directionAngle, distance);\nif (waypointCount > 0) {\n    // Use the generated\
      \ waypoints to move NPC in a straight line\n    // Implementation would iterate\
      \ through stored waypoints\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with TrinityCore's navigation mesh system and
    may require valid start positions and direction vectors. The returned integer
    value should be checked for error conditions before proceeding with movement logic.
    Performance considerations include the number of waypoints generated; large distances
    may result in many intermediate nodes.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'start' parameter refers to a valid node or position within
    the navigation system, otherwise the method may fail or produce invalid waypoints.
    The direction parameter should be interpreted correctly as either an angle or
    vector depending on internal implementation details.
