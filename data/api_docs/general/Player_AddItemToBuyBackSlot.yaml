  class: Player
  method: AddItemToBuyBackSlot
  signature: void Player::AddItemToBuyBackSlot(Item * pItem)
documentation:
  brief: Adds an item to the player's buyback slot, allowing the player to retrieve
    it later.
  description: The AddItemToBuyBackSlot method enables a player to store an item in
    their buyback inventory, which is a temporary storage area for items that have
    been sold or looted. This functionality is crucial for managing item retention
    when the player's inventory is full, or when items are sold back to vendors. The
    method handles the item's movement from the player's main inventory to the buyback
    slot, ensuring proper storage and preventing loss of the item. It also updates
    the player's buyback slot status and maintains proper item tracking for subsequent
    retrieval.
  parameters:
  - name: pItem
    description: A pointer to the Item object that will be added to the buyback slot.
      This item must already exist in the player's inventory or be created through
      other means.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Item* item = new Item();

      player->AddItemToBuyBackSlot(item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be called when the player's inventory is full or when items
    are sold back to vendors. It may involve updating the player's buyback slot status
    and maintaining proper item tracking for retrieval. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with other methods like AddItemToInventory or RemoveItemFromInventory.
  warnings: The method does not handle item destruction or deletion; it simply moves
    items to the buyback slot. Care should be taken when using this method to ensure
    that items are properly stored and retrieved, as improper handling can lead to
    item loss or incorrect inventory management.
