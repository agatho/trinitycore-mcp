documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell contains only damage effects and no other effect
    types.
  description: This method checks if a SpellInfo object represents a spell that applies
    only damage effects, without any additional effects such as healing, harmful effects,
    or other non-damage effects. It is commonly used in spell processing logic to
    identify spells that are purely damage-based, which can be important for game
    mechanics like damage calculations, spell filtering, and determining whether a
    spell should be processed in specific contexts. The method returns true if the
    spell contains only damage-related effects, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell has only damage effects; otherwise returns false.
    This indicates that the spell does not include any non-damage effects such as
    healing or harmful effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (spellInfo->HasOnlyDamageEffects()) {\n    // Process damage-only spell\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell effect checks
    to determine the nature of a spell. It may be useful for identifying spells that
    are purely damage-dealing and not involving healing or other effects.
  warnings: This method should not be used as the sole determinant for spell processing,
    as it does not account for all possible spell effect combinations. Always consider
    additional spell properties when evaluating spell behavior.
