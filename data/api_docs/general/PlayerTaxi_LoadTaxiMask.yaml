  class: PlayerTaxi
  method: LoadTaxiMask
  signature: bool PlayerTaxi::LoadTaxiMask(const std::string & data)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes the player's taxi route mask data from a string representation.
  description: The LoadTaxiMask method parses a serialized string containing taxi
    route data and applies it to the player's current taxi mask. This functionality
    is essential for restoring a player's known taxi routes upon login or when loading
    saved game state. The method typically handles parsing of bitmask data that represents
    which taxi nodes have been discovered by the player. It ensures that only valid
    and properly formatted data is applied, returning false if the input string is
    malformed or contains invalid entries. This method is part of the player's taxi
    system integration within TrinityCore's core mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A string containing serialized taxi route mask data, typically formatted
      as a bitmask or comma-separated list of taxi node IDs that the player has discovered.
  returns: Returns true if the taxi mask was successfully loaded and processed from
    the provided data string; returns false if the input data is invalid, malformed,
    or cannot be parsed correctly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PlayerTaxi* taxi = player->GetPlayerTaxi();\nstd::string savedMask = \"\
      1,2,5,8,10\";\nbool success = taxi->LoadTaxiMask(savedMask);\nif (success) {\n\
      \    // Taxi mask loaded successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Taxi routes loaded\
      \ successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to load taxi mask\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to load taxi routes from saved data.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player login or character loading
    processes. The input string format should match the expected serialization format
    used by the server's save system. The method performs validation on the input
    data to prevent corruption of the player's taxi route state.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or malformed data string may result in incomplete or
    incorrect taxi route data being applied, potentially causing players to lose access
    to known routes or experience unexpected behavior during travel.
