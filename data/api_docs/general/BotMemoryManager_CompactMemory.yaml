  method: CompactMemory
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::CompactMemory()
documentation:
  brief: Compacts memory allocations within the bot memory manager to optimize memory
    usage and reduce fragmentation.
  description: The CompactMemory method is responsible for optimizing memory usage
    within the BotMemoryManager by consolidating allocated memory blocks and reducing
    fragmentation. This process helps improve performance by minimizing memory waste
    and ensuring efficient allocation patterns. The method typically operates on internal
    memory pools managed by the bot system, particularly relevant in scenarios where
    bots are dynamically created, destroyed, or reconfigured during gameplay. It is
    commonly invoked during periodic cleanup routines or when memory pressure is detected
    to maintain optimal resource utilization.

  - title: Basic Memory Compaction
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = sObjectMgr->GetBotMemoryManager();

      memoryManager->CompactMemory();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may cause temporary performance degradation during execution
    as it reorganizes memory blocks. It is recommended to call this method during
    low-activity periods or when the system is not under heavy load to avoid impacting
    gameplay responsiveness.
  warnings: Calling CompactMemory while bots are actively processing commands or executing
    behaviors may lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. Ensure all bot
    operations are suspended before invoking this method.
