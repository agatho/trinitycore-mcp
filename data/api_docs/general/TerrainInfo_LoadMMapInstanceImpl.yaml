  class: TerrainInfo
  method: LoadMMapInstanceImpl
  signature: void TerrainInfo::LoadMMapInstanceImpl(uint32 mapId, uint32 instanceId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads the navigation mesh data for a specific map instance used by the pathfinding
    system.
  description: The LoadMMapInstanceImpl method initializes and loads the navigation
    mesh (mmap) data for a given map and instance ID. This is an internal implementation
    detail of the TerrainInfo class that prepares the terrain data required for AI
    pathfinding and movement calculations in World of Warcraft. The method typically
    gets invoked when a player enters a new instance or when the server needs to ensure
    that pathfinding data is available for a specific map area. It handles loading
    the appropriate mmap files from disk or memory cache, ensuring that the navigation
    system can accurately compute paths for creatures and players within that instance.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map for which to load navigation mesh
      data. This corresponds to the Map.dbc entry ID.
  - name: instanceId
    description: The instance identifier for the specific instance of the map. A value
      of 0 indicates the default world map, while non-zero values represent instances
      such as dungeons or raids.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading mmap data for a dungeon instance
    code: "TerrainInfo* terrain = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainInfo(0, 1234);\nif (terrain)\n\
      {\n    terrain->LoadMMapInstanceImpl(1, 5678); // Load mmap for map 1, instance\
      \ 5678\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server's terrain management
    system and should not be invoked directly by most game logic. The method assumes
    that the required mmap files are present in the expected directory structure.
    It may block during file I/O operations if the data isn't already cached.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid map or instance IDs can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the map and instance identifiers are valid before
    calling this function.
