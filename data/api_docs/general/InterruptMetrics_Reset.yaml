  brief: Resets all interrupt-related metrics to their default state
  description: The Reset method clears and initializes all internal counters and tracking
    data within the InterruptMetrics class. This method is typically invoked when
    resetting performance monitoring or statistics related to spell interruptions
    in the game engine. It ensures that subsequent measurements start from a clean
    baseline without any residual data from previous sessions or operations.

  notes: This method should be called before starting new performance measurements
    or when transitioning between different game states where interrupt statistics
    need to be reset. It does not affect any active gameplay elements but only clears
    internal tracking data.
