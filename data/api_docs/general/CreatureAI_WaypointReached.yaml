  class: CreatureAI
  method: WaypointReached
  signature: void CreatureAI::WaypointReached(int param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature reaches a waypoint in its path.
  description: The WaypointReached method is invoked by the TrinityCore AI system
    when a CreatureAI-controlled creature successfully arrives at a defined waypoint
    during waypoint-based movement. This callback allows custom AI behavior to be
    executed upon reaching specific locations, such as triggering events, changing
    states, or initiating dialogue. The method is part of the standard CreatureAI
    interface and is typically overridden in custom AI implementations to provide
    unique creature behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The ID of the waypoint that was reached.
  - name: param1
    description: The path ID associated with the waypoint that was reached.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Waypoint Reached Implementation
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void WaypointReached(int\
      \ waypointId, int pathId) override\n    {\n        if (waypointId == 5)\n  \
      \      {\n            // Trigger an event when reaching waypoint 5\n       \
      \     DoCast(SPELL_SPECIAL_EFFECT);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from within the AI update loop, so custom implementations
    should avoid heavy computations or blocking operations. The waypoint and path
    IDs are typically defined in the creature's database entries.
