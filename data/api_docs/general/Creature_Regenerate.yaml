  class: Creature
  method: Regenerate
  signature: void Creature::Regenerate(int power)
documentation:
  brief: Regenerates the creature's power (mana, rage, energy, etc.) by the specified
    amount.
  description: The Regenerate method is used to restore a creature's power resource,
    such as mana, rage, or energy, by a given amount. This method is typically invoked
    during gameplay to simulate natural regeneration over time or as a result of specific
    game mechanics like spell effects or abilities. The method directly modifies the
    creature's current power value, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum power
    capacity. It may be called internally by the game engine or explicitly by scripts
    and AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: power
    description: The amount of power to regenerate. Positive values increase the creature's
      power, while negative values decrease it (though this is generally not recommended
      for direct usage).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Power Regeneration
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->Regenerate(50); // Regenerates 50 points of power'
    language: cpp
  - title: Partial Regeneration with Conditional Logic
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nif (creature->GetPowerType() == POWER_MANA)\n\
      {\n    creature->Regenerate(25);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the input value; it directly
    applies the change to the creature's power. It is recommended to ensure that the
    value passed is within reasonable bounds to prevent unexpected behavior or overflow
    issues. The method may be called from different threads, so thread safety should
    be considered if used in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Calling Regenerate with a negative value will reduce the creature's power,
    which might lead to undesirable game states if not handled carefully. Avoid calling
    this method excessively in tight loops as it could impact performance or cause
    unintended behavior in combat systems.
