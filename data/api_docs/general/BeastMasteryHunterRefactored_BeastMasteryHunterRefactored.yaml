  method: BeastMasteryHunterRefactored
  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::BeastMasteryHunterRefactored(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Beast Mastery Hunter AI behavior for the specified player bot.
  description: The BeastMasteryHunterRefactored constructor initializes the AI behavior
    for a Beast Mastery Hunter class player bot. This method sets up the core mechanics
    and decision-making logic specific to the Beast Mastery specialization, including
    pet management, ability selection, and tactical positioning. It configures the
    bot's AI to follow Beast Mastery-specific strategies such as optimal pet usage,
    cooldown management, and resource allocation. The initialization process ensures
    that the bot can properly execute Beast Mastery abilities while maintaining proper
    combat efficiency and adherence to class-specific gameplay mechanics.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to hunter bot

      BeastMasteryHunterRefactored ai(bot);

      // AI is now initialized and ready for combat'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The method
    assumes that the provided Player object has already been validated as a Beast
    Mastery Hunter class. The initialization process may take several milliseconds
    to complete depending on the complexity of the AI implementation.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same bot instance,
    as it may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure the Player pointer
    is valid and points to an actual hunter character with Beast Mastery specialization
    before calling this method.
