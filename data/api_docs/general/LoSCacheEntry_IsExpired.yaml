  signature: bool LoSCacheEntry::IsExpired(uint32 currentTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a line-of-sight cache entry has expired based on the current
    time.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if a LoSCacheEntry object has exceeded
    its valid lifetime. This is typically used in TrinityCore's pathfinding and line-of-sight
    systems to manage cached data for performance optimization. The method compares
    the entry's internal expiration timestamp with the provided current time value.
    If the current time is greater than or equal to the stored expiration time, the
    entry is considered expired and should be removed or refreshed from the cache.
    This mechanism helps prevent stale data from being used in calculations while
    maintaining efficient memory usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the cache entry has expired (current time >= expiration
    time), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\nif (cacheEntry.IsExpired(currentTime))\
      \ {\n    // Handle expired cache entry\n    Log(\"Cache entry expired, needs\
      \ refresh\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Cache Management
    code: "void UpdateLosCache() {\n    uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\n\
      \    for (auto& entry : losCache) {\n        if (entry.IsExpired(currentTime))\
      \ {\n            // Remove expired entries\n            entry.Clear();\n   \
      \     }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the internal expiration time is properly set when
    the cache entry is created or updated. This is typically managed by the LoSCache
    system itself, which sets appropriate TTL (time-to-live) values based on game
    mechanics and performance requirements.
  warnings: This method should not be called with invalid time values. If currentTime
    is significantly lower than the stored expiration time, it may indicate a system
    clock issue or incorrect time handling in the calling code.
