  class: GroupStateMachine
  method: RecordTransition
  signature: void GroupStateMachine::RecordTransition(GroupState fromState, GroupState
    toState, GroupStateTransition transition)
documentation:
  brief: Records a state transition within the group management system.
  description: The RecordTransition method logs a change from one group state to another,
    capturing the transition type for tracking and debugging purposes. This method
    is typically used internally by the GroupStateMachine to maintain an audit trail
    of group lifecycle events such as joining, leaving, or disbanding. It ensures
    that all state changes are properly documented for system integrity and potential
    rollback mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: fromState
    description: The initial state of the group before the transition occurs. Valid
      values are defined by the GroupState enumeration.
  - name: toState
    description: The target state of the group after the transition has been completed.
      Must be a valid GroupState value.
  - name: transition
    description: Describes the type of transition that occurred, such as JOIN, LEAVE,
      or DISBAND. This parameter defines the nature of the state change.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a group join transition
    code: 'GroupStateMachine stateMachine;

      GroupState from = GROUP_STATE_NONE;

      GroupState to = GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE;

      GroupStateTransition trans = GROUP_TRANSITION_JOIN;

      stateMachine.RecordTransition(from, to, trans);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging a group disband transition
    code: 'GroupStateMachine stateMachine;

      GroupState from = GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE;

      GroupState to = GROUP_STATE_NONE;

      GroupStateTransition trans = GROUP_TRANSITION_DISBAND;

      stateMachine.RecordTransition(from, to, trans);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the input parameters; it is
    assumed that the caller provides valid GroupState and GroupStateTransition values.
    The implementation may store transitions in an internal log or data structure
    for later retrieval.
