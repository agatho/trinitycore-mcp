  class: EchoController
  method: ~EchoController
  signature: void EchoController::~EchoController()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an EchoController instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~EchoController destructor is automatically invoked when an EchoController
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, closes active connections, and performs
    necessary resource deallocation to prevent memory leaks. In the context of TrinityCore's
    architecture, this destructor likely handles cleanup for echo-related functionalities
    such as network communication, data buffers, or internal state management. The
    destruction process is typically non-blocking and should not be called directly
    by user code unless explicitly managing object lifecycle.

  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    EchoController controller;\n    // ... use controller\n\
      \    // Destructor called automatically when controller goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'EchoController* controller = new EchoController();

      // ... use controller

      delete controller; // Triggers destructor

      controller = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects are destroyed.
    Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless implementing custom memory
    management patterns. The EchoController class likely maintains internal data structures
    that require proper cleanup to avoid resource leaks.
  warnings: Avoid calling the destructor directly on stack-allocated objects as this
    leads to undefined behavior. Ensure all references to the controller are cleared
    before destruction to prevent dangling pointers.
