  class: PathfindingManager
  method: GetDangerAtPosition
  signature: float PathfindingManager::GetDangerAtPosition(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the danger level at a specified position within the
    game world.
  description: The GetDangerAtPosition method evaluates the threat level or danger
    associated with a given location in the game world. This function is typically
    used by AI pathfinding systems to determine safe routes for NPCs or players, taking
    into account various environmental hazards, enemy presence, and other risk factors.
    The returned float value represents a normalized danger score, where higher values
    indicate more dangerous positions. The method likely uses internal data structures
    such as threat maps, NPC positioning, and environmental triggers to compute this
    value.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the game
      world. This could be a unique coordinate index, node ID, or grid cell reference
      depending on how positions are internally represented within the pathfinding
      system.
  returns: A float value indicating the danger level at the specified position. Values
    typically range from 0.0 (no danger) to 1.0 (maximum danger), though exact ranges
    may vary based on implementation details and game context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float dangerLevel = pathfindingManager->GetDangerAtPosition(42);\nif (dangerLevel\
      \ > 0.7f) {\n    // Avoid this position\n    printf(\"High danger at position\
      \ 42\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Pathfinding Decision Making
    code: "int currentPosition = GetPlayerPosition();\nfloat currentDanger = pathfindingManager->GetDangerAtPosition(currentPosition);\n\
      int nextPosition = GetNextNodeInPath();\nfloat nextDanger = pathfindingManager->GetDangerAtPosition(nextPosition);\n\
      \nif (nextDanger < currentDanger) {\n    // Proceed to next position\n    MoveToPosition(nextPosition);\n\
      } else {\n    // Find alternative route\n    FindNewPath(currentPosition);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely computationally expensive and should be used judiciously
    in performance-critical code paths. It may cache results internally to improve
    efficiency when called repeatedly with similar positions. The exact calculation
    methodology depends on the underlying threat assessment system implemented in
    TrinityCore's AI framework.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid position identifiers may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect danger calculations. Ensure that the position parameter
    corresponds to valid nodes or coordinates within the current pathfinding grid
    or map structure.
