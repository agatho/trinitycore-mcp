  method: GetRandomRaceClassByDistribution
  signature: std::pair<uint8, uint8> BotCharacterDistribution::GetRandomRaceClassByDistribution()
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a random race and class pair based on configured distribution
    weights for bot characters.
  description: The GetRandomRaceClassByDistribution method selects a random combination
    of race and class for bot characters using pre-defined probability distributions.
    This method is typically used in TrinityCore's bot system to ensure that generated
    bot characters adhere to specified statistical distributions rather than uniform
    randomness. The returned pair represents the race and class as uint8 values, which
    correspond to the standard World of Warcraft race and class identifiers. The distribution
    weights are usually configured through configuration files or database entries
    and define how frequently each race-class combination should appear in the bot
    population.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::pair<uint8, uint8> where the first element represents the selected
    race ID and the second element represents the selected class ID. Both values are
    unsigned 8-bit integers that map to standard WoW race and class constants.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution distribution;

      std::pair<uint8, uint8> raceClass = distribution.GetRandomRaceClassByDistribution();

      uint8 race = raceClass.first;

      uint8 className = raceClass.second;

      // Use race and class to create a bot character

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal probability distribution tables that must
    be properly initialized before calling. The randomness is typically seeded using
    the system's random number generator, so multiple calls may produce different
    results. Performance is generally fast as it uses pre-computed cumulative distribution
    tables for efficient lookup.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot character distribution configuration has been properly
    loaded and validated before calling this method. If no valid distributions exist,
    the method might return invalid race/class combinations or throw exceptions depending
    on implementation details.
