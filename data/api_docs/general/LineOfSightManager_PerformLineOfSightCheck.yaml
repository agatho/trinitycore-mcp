  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: PerformLineOfSightCheck
  signature: LoSResult LineOfSightManager::PerformLineOfSightCheck(const LoSContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Performs a line-of-sight check using the provided context to determine if
    two points are mutually visible.
  description: The PerformLineOfSightCheck method evaluates whether there is an unobstructed
    visual path between two points in the game world. It utilizes the LoSContext parameter
    to define the start and end positions, as well as any relevant flags or settings
    for the check. This functionality is essential for determining if a character
    can see another character or object, which impacts gameplay mechanics such as
    spell casting, targeting, and AI behavior. The method returns a LoSResult indicating
    whether the line of sight is clear or blocked by terrain, objects, or other environmental
    factors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a LoSResult enum value that indicates the outcome of the line-of-sight
    check. Possible values may include LOSE_OK for clear sight, LOSE_BLOCKED for obstructed
    sight, and potentially others depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Line-of-Sight Check
    code: "LoSContext context;\ncontext.start = Position(100.0f, 100.0f, 10.0f);\n\
      context.end = Position(200.0f, 200.0f, 15.0f);\nLoSResult result = lineOfSightManager->PerformLineOfSightCheck(context);\n\
      if (result == LOSE_OK) {\n    // Line of sight is clear\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform expensive calculations involving collision detection
    and spatial queries. It should be used judiciously in performance-critical code
    paths. The context object must contain valid position data; otherwise, results
    are undefined.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initializing the LoSContext can lead
    to incorrect results or runtime errors. Ensure that both start and end positions
    are within valid world coordinates before invoking the check.
