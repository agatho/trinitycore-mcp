  brief: Initializes a retribution paladin bot with default settings and behavior.
  description: The RetributionPaladinRefactored constructor initializes a player object
    as a retribution paladin bot, setting up core attributes, abilities, and AI behavior
    specific to the retribution specialization. This method configures the bot's spell
    selection, combat strategy, and resource management according to retribution paladin
    gameplay mechanics. The initialization includes setting up proper talent builds,
    weapon handling, and ability prioritization for optimal damage output in both
    single-target and AoE scenarios.

  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      RetributionPaladinRefactored retributionBot(bot);

      // Bot is now initialized as a retribution paladin with default settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes the provided Player object has been properly allocated
    and configured. The method does not perform any validation on the input player
    object, so it's expected that the caller ensures proper initialization of the
    Player before passing it to this constructor.
