  signature: void InstanceScript::HandleGameObject(int guid, bool open, GameObject
    * go)
documentation:
  brief: Handles GameObject state changes such as opening or closing doors and chests
    within an instance.
  description: The HandleGameObject method is used to manage the state of GameObjects
    within a dungeon or raid instance. It allows for controlling whether a GameObject
    (such as a door, chest, or other interactive object) is open or closed. This method
    is typically invoked by the InstanceScript when specific events occur, such as
    defeating a boss or activating a puzzle mechanism. The method updates the GameObject's
    state in the world and ensures that any associated triggers or scripts are properly
    executed. It supports both opening and closing operations depending on the boolean
    parameter provided.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the GameObject to be handled. This
      value is used to locate and manipulate the specific GameObject within the instance.
  - name: open
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the GameObject should be opened
      (true) or closed (false).
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the GameObject object itself. This parameter allows direct
      manipulation of the GameObject's properties and state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Open a Door After Boss Kill
    code: "void InstanceScript::OnBossKill(uint32 bossId)\n{\n    if (bossId == BOSS_MARWYN)\n\
      \    {\n        HandleGameObject(123456, true, nullptr);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Close a Chest After Player Interaction
    code: "void InstanceScript::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetGUID()\
      \ == 789012)\n    {\n        GameObject* chest = instance->GetGameObject(345678);\n\
      \        if (chest)\n        {\n            HandleGameObject(chest->GetGUID(),\
      \ false, chest);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with GameObject templates and
    instance data to manage dynamic environments. It's important to ensure that the
    GUID corresponds to a valid GameObject within the current instance; otherwise,
    the operation may fail silently or cause unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Incorrectly passing an invalid GUID or null GameObject pointer can lead
    to undefined behavior. Always verify that the GameObject exists before calling
    this method. Additionally, calling this method outside of proper event contexts
    might interfere with normal game flow or trigger unintended side effects.
