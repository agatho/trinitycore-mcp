  brief: Determines whether a buff action is beneficial or useful for the bot's current
    state
  description: The IsUseful method evaluates if a specific buff action should be applied
    based on the bot's current conditions and needs. It checks various factors such
    as existing buffs, cooldowns, mana levels, and combat status to determine if applying
    this particular buff would provide meaningful benefit. This method is typically
    used by the AI system to make decisions about which actions to prioritize when
    managing the bot's spell casting behavior. The method relies on the provided BotAI
    context to assess the bot's current state and make an informed decision.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the buff action is considered useful or beneficial for
    the bot's current situation, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (buffAction.IsUseful(ai)) {\n    // Apply the buff\n    ai->CastSpell(buffAction.GetSpellId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with bot AI action selection
    code: "class MyBotAI : public BotAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI() override {\n\
      \        for (auto& action : buffActions) {\n            if (action.IsUseful(this))\
      \ {\n                // Prioritize this useful buff\n                CastBuff(action);\n\
      \                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the bot's current health, mana,
    buffs/debuffs, and combat state. It may also consider the bot's class-specific
    needs and the spell's effectiveness in the current situation. The implementation
    might cache results or use short-term memory to avoid redundant computations.
  warnings: The method may return false even if a buff is technically available, as
    it considers contextual factors beyond simple availability. Developers should
    ensure that the BotAI parameter is properly initialized before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior.
