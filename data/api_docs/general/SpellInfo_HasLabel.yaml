  signature: bool SpellInfo::HasLabel(uint32 labelId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the spell has a specific label assigned to it.
  description: This method determines whether a given spell possesses a particular
    label identifier. It is commonly used in spell-related logic to verify label assignments,
    particularly in the context of World of Warcraft's spell system where labels are
    used for various game mechanics such as spell effects, triggers, or custom behaviors.
    The method returns true if the label exists within the spell's label collection,
    false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell contains the specified label ID, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->HasLabel(12345)) {\n    // Do something\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a simple lookup operation on the spell's label collection,
    making it efficient for checking label existence. Implementation details suggest
    that labels are stored in an internal map or set structure for fast access.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine whether a spell is valid or
    active; it only checks label presence. Be cautious when using this method with
    dynamic label IDs as they may not always be present.
