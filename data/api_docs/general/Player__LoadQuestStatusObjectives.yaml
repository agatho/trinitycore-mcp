  brief: Loads quest status objectives for the player
  description: This method initializes and loads the quest status objectives for the
    player, typically called during player initialization or when quest data needs
    to be refreshed. It handles the internal tracking of quest progress and objective
    completion states. The method ensures that all quest-related objectives are properly
    loaded and available for subsequent gameplay interactions.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_LoadQuestStatusObjectives(0);

      // This would load quest objectives for the player

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by TrinityCore during player
    loading process. It may involve database queries to retrieve quest status data
    and should be called only once per player session.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code without proper
    context; it's designed for internal use within the core system.
