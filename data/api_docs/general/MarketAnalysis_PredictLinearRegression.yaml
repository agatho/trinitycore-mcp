documentation:
  brief: Predicts future market price using linear regression analysis based on historical
    item data.
  description: The PredictLinearRegression method performs a linear regression analysis
    to forecast the future price of a specified item in the game market. It utilizes
    historical pricing data for the given item to calculate a trend line and extrapolate
    the price at a specified number of hours ahead. This method is typically used
    by market analysis systems or automated trading bots to anticipate price movements.
    The prediction assumes a linear trend in the historical data and does not account
    for sudden market disruptions, seasonal factors, or external game events that
    might affect pricing.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which to predict the price.
      Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: hoursAhead
    description: The number of hours into the future to predict the price. Should
      be a positive integer representing the time horizon for the prediction.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the predicted market price for the specified
    item at the given time in the future. A negative return value may indicate an
    error or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Price Prediction
    code: float predictedPrice = marketAnalysis->PredictLinearRegression(12345, 24);
      // Predict price 24 hours ahead for item ID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Predictions for Trend Analysis
    code: "for (int i = 1; i <= 72; i += 6) {\n    float price = marketAnalysis->PredictLinearRegression(12345,\
      \ i);\n    printf(\"Predicted price in %d hours: %.2f\\n\", i, price);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on historical data being available for the specified item.
    If insufficient or no historical data exists, the prediction may be unreliable.
    The linear regression model assumes a consistent pricing trend and does not factor
    in market volatility, supply/demand fluctuations, or game events that could alter
    price dynamics.
  warnings: The prediction accuracy decreases significantly for longer time horizons
    due to the linear nature of the model. Using this method for critical trading
    decisions without validation against actual market behavior is discouraged. The
    method may return unexpected values if item data is corrupted or missing from
    the database.
