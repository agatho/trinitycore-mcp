  signature: Unit * CombatManager::GetAnyTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a valid target unit from the combat manager's current target list,
    or nullptr if no targets exist.
  description: The GetAnyTarget method retrieves any valid target unit currently tracked
    by the CombatManager. This method is typically used in AI logic to determine which
    enemy unit to engage or prioritize for actions such as melee attacks, spells,
    or movement. The returned Unit pointer may be null if there are no active targets
    in the combat manager's internal target list. It does not guarantee that the returned
    target is the primary or highest-priority target, but rather any available target
    within the manager's scope. This method is commonly used in combat AI decision-making
    processes where a general target selection is needed without specific priority
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a Unit object representing any valid combat target currently
    managed by this CombatManager instance, or nullptr if no targets are available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (Unit* target = combatManager->GetAnyTarget()) {\n    // Perform action\
      \ against the target\n    me->Attack(target, true);\n} else {\n    // No targets\
      \ available\n    me->CombatStop();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for valid target before spell casting
    code: "Unit* target = combatManager->GetAnyTarget();\nif (target && !target->IsDead())\
      \ {\n    // Cast a spell on the target\n    me->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns any available target without prioritization. The CombatManager
    may internally maintain multiple target lists or priorities, but this method provides
    access to a single arbitrary valid target. It is recommended to check for nullptr
    before using the returned Unit pointer to avoid null pointer dereferences.
  warnings: The returned Unit pointer should not be assumed to remain valid beyond
    the current execution context. CombatManager targets may change during combat
    updates, and the pointer could become invalid if the target dies or is removed
    from combat. Always verify that the target is still valid before using it in actions.
