  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: SetFormation
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::SetFormation(FormationType type)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the formation type for the position strategy.
  description: The SetFormation method configures the formation type that will be
    used by the PositionStrategyBase class. This method is typically used in AI behavior
    systems to define how units should position themselves relative to each other,
    such as in a group or formation. The formation type determines the spatial arrangement
    and movement patterns of entities using this strategy. This method does not validate
    the input formation type, so it's expected that valid FormationType values are
    passed to avoid undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Circular Formation
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase strategy;

      strategy.SetFormation(FORMATION_CIRCLE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a Line Formation for Group Movement
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase* aiStrategy = new PositionStrategyBase();

      aiStrategy->SetFormation(FORMATION_LINE);

      // Used in AI logic to determine positioning during group movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI positioning system in TrinityCore. It's typically
    called during initialization or when changing formation behavior dynamically.
    The actual implementation of how formations are applied depends on the derived
    classes that inherit from PositionStrategyBase.
  warnings: Ensure that the FormationType enum values passed to this method are valid
    and defined within the TrinityCore codebase, as invalid values may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect positioning logic.
