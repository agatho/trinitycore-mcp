documentation:
  brief: Initializes a neural network layer with specified input and output sizes
    and activation function
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal structure of a NeuralLayer
    object by configuring its input size, output size, and activation function. This
    method is typically called during the construction or setup phase of a neural
    network to define the layer's dimensions and behavior. The inputSize parameter
    determines how many inputs the layer expects, while outputSize defines how many
    outputs it will produce. The actFunc parameter specifies which activation function
    should be applied to the layer's computed values. This method does not validate
    the parameters beyond basic type checking, so callers should ensure valid values
    are provided. Once initialized, the layer can be used in forward and backward
    propagation operations within a neural network.
  parameters:
  - name: inputSize
    description: The number of input neurons or features that this layer will accept.
      Must be a positive integer representing the dimensionality of the input vector.
  - name: outputSize
    description: The number of output neurons or values that this layer will produce.
      Must be a positive integer representing the dimensionality of the output vector.
  - name: actFunc
    description: The activation function to be applied to each neuron's output. Should
      be an enum or identifier representing a valid activation function such as ReLU,
      Sigmoid, or Tanh.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Layer Initialization
    code: 'NeuralLayer layer;

      layer.Initialize(784, 128, ActivationFunction::ReLU);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Output Layer
    code: 'NeuralLayer outputLayer;

      outputLayer.Initialize(128, 10, ActivationFunction::Softmax);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method allocates memory for the layer's weights and biases based on
    inputSize and outputSize. It is recommended to call Initialize before any training
    or inference operations. The activation function must be properly registered with
    the neural network framework, otherwise runtime errors may occur.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same NeuralLayer object will
    overwrite existing configuration without warning. Ensure that inputSize and outputSize
    are appropriate for your intended use case to avoid dimension mismatch errors
    during computation.
