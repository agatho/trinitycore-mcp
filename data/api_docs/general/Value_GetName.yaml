  brief: Returns the name associated with the Value object
  description: The GetName method retrieves the string name that is associated with
    the current Value instance. This method is typically used in the context of game
    objects, data structures, or configuration values where a human-readable identifier
    is required. The returned reference points to an internal string member of the
    Value class, ensuring efficient access without unnecessary copying. The method
    does not modify any state and is safe to call from multiple threads if the underlying
    data is properly synchronized.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the name of the Value
    object. This string is guaranteed to be valid for the lifetime of the Value instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Value* value = new Value("PlayerName");

      std::cout << value->GetName() << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Game Context
    code: "if (Creature* creature = ObjectAccessor::GetCreature(*player, guid))\n\
      {\n    std::string creatureName = creature->GetName();\n    // Use creatureName\
      \ for logging or UI display\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference is valid only as long as the Value object exists.
    Calling GetName on a destroyed Value instance results in undefined behavior. The
    implementation assumes that the name has been properly initialized during construction
    or assignment.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned string reference directly, as it may lead to
    unexpected behavior. If you need to modify the name, use a setter method instead.
    Be cautious when storing references to GetName() return values across function
    calls, especially in multi-threaded environments.
