documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the ConditionsReference object contains no conditions.
  description: The IsEmpty method determines if a ConditionsReference object has no
    associated conditions. This is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore server to evaluate whether a set of conditional requirements (such
    as quest states, player levels, or item ownership) have been defined for a specific
    game event or action. The method returns true if the reference contains zero conditions,
    and false otherwise. It is commonly used before performing condition evaluations
    to avoid unnecessary processing when no conditions exist.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ConditionsReference object contains no conditions;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for empty conditions
    code: "ConditionsReference ref;\nif (ref.IsEmpty()) {\n    // No conditions are\
      \ defined\n    printf(\"No conditions present\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Conditions\
      \ exist and can be evaluated\n    printf(\"Conditions are present\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsEmpty before condition evaluation
    code: "ConditionsReference ref;\n// ... populate ref with conditions ...\nif (!ref.IsEmpty())\
      \ {\n    // Only evaluate conditions if they exist\n    bool result = ref.Evaluate();\n\
      \    // Process result\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple boolean check that does not involve any complex logic
    or database access. It directly inspects internal state flags or container sizes
    to determine if conditions are present.
