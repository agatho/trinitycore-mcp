  class: EquipmentManager
  method: CalculateItemScore
  signature: float EquipmentManager::CalculateItemScore(int * player, int * item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the item score for a given player and item combination
    based on equipment statistics and character progression.
  description: The CalculateItemScore method computes a numerical score representing
    the relative value or effectiveness of an item when equipped by a specific player.
    This score is typically used in game systems such as item comparison, vendor pricing,
    loot distribution, or AI decision-making processes. The calculation considers
    various item attributes like stats, quality, level, and the player's current equipment
    state. The method requires valid pointers to both player and item data structures
    to perform its computation accurately. It does not modify any input parameters
    but may access internal game state related to both the player and item.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object for which the item score is being calculated.
      Must point to a valid Player instance with initialized equipment data.
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the item object whose score is being evaluated. Must point
      to a valid Item instance containing all necessary stat and quality information.
  returns: A floating-point value representing the calculated item score. Higher values
    indicate more powerful or valuable items. The exact scoring algorithm may vary
    based on item type, player class, and game progression mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Valid player pointer\nItem* item = ...;     //\
      \ Valid item pointer\nfloat score = EquipmentManager::CalculateItemScore(player,\
      \ item);\nif (score > 100.0f)\n{\n    // Item is considered high-value\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparison of Multiple Items
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* item1 = ...;\nItem* item2 = ...;\nfloat score1\
      \ = EquipmentManager::CalculateItemScore(player, item1);\nfloat score2 = EquipmentManager::CalculateItemScore(player,\
      \ item2);\nif (score1 > score2)\n{\n    // item1 is better for the player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations involving item stats such as damage,
    armor, resistances, and other attributes. It may incorporate scaling factors based
    on player level or class-specific modifiers. The implementation might cache intermediate
    values for performance optimization in frequent calls.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and item pointers are valid before calling this
    method to prevent undefined behavior. Invalid pointers can lead to crashes or
    incorrect scoring results. This function should not be called during critical
    sections where player or item data is being modified concurrently.
