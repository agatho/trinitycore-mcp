  brief: Checks whether a player has an active quest with the specified ID
  description: This method determines if a player currently has an active quest with
    the given quest ID in their quest log. It returns true if the quest is active
    and false if it's not, or if the quest ID is invalid. The method is commonly used
    in quest-related logic to verify quest status during quest completion checks or
    when handling quest events. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper
    quest progression and ensuring that players can't complete quests they don't have
    active.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has an active quest with the specified ID, false
    otherwise. If the quest ID does not exist in the player's quest log, the method
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsActiveQuest(12345))\n{\n    // Quest is active\n    // Perform\
      \ actions\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Quest is not active\n    // Handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally checks the player's quest log for the presence of
    a quest with the specified ID. It does not validate if the quest exists in the
    database, but rather checks if it's currently active in the player's log.
  warnings: Be aware that this method will return false if the quest ID is invalid
    or doesn't exist in the player's quest log, which could lead to incorrect assumptions
    about quest status if not properly handled.
