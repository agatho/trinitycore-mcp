  class: TargetSelector
  method: SelectWeakestTarget
  signature: SelectionResult TargetSelector::SelectWeakestTarget(float maxRange, TargetValidation
    validation)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the weakest target within the specified range using the configured
    validation criteria.
  description: The SelectWeakestTarget method identifies and returns the target with
    the lowest health percentage or threat level within the given maximum range. It
    evaluates all valid targets based on the current TargetValidation settings, which
    may include checking for hostility, line of sight, and other conditions. This
    method is commonly used in AI behavior trees to determine the most vulnerable
    enemy for attacks or abilities. The selection process respects the configured
    validation rules and ensures that only suitable targets are considered.
  parameters:
  - name: maxRange
    description: Maximum distance in yards within which targets will be considered
      for selection. Targets beyond this range will be ignored.
  - name: validation
    description: TargetValidation object containing criteria for target eligibility,
      such as hostility checks, line of sight requirements, and other filtering rules.
  returns: SelectionResult object containing the selected target if one was found
    within range and validation criteria. Returns an empty or invalid result if no
    suitable targets exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to select weakest target
    code: "SelectionResult result = selector.SelectWeakestTarget(30.0f, TargetValidation::Hostile);\n\
      if (result.IsValid()) {\n    Unit* target = result.GetTarget();\n    // Proceed\
      \ with attack logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with custom validation
    code: "TargetValidation validation;\nvalidation.SetCheckLineOfSight(true);\nvalidation.SetCheckHostile(true);\n\
      validation.SetCheckInCombat(true);\nSelectionResult result = selector.SelectWeakestTarget(40.0f,\
      \ validation);\nif (result.IsValid()) {\n    Unit* target = result.GetTarget();\n\
      \    // Use target for spell casting or melee attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full scan of available targets within range and applies
    the provided validation rules to filter candidates. Performance may be impacted
    when dealing with large numbers of nearby units. The selection algorithm prioritizes
    targets based on health percentage, but can be extended to include threat level
    or other metrics depending on implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that maxRange is set appropriately to avoid unnecessary processing
    of distant units. The validation parameter should be properly configured to prevent
    selecting invalid targets such as friendly units or those outside line of sight.
