  class: NPCEvent
  method: BankOpened
  signature: NPCEvent NPCEvent::BankOpened(int playerGuid, int npcGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns an NPCEvent instance indicating that a player has opened
    a bank window with an NPC.
  description: The BankOpened method is used to generate an NPCEvent object that represents
    the action of a player opening their bank window interacted with an NPC. This
    event is typically triggered when a player interacts with a banker NPC and opens
    their personal bank tab. The method takes the GUIDs of both the player and the
    NPC involved in the interaction, creating a standardized event representation
    for further processing within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality supports
    quest tracking, event logging, and other game mechanics that depend on player-NPC
    interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who opened the bank window.
      Must be a valid player GUID from the database.
  - name: npcGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the NPC with whom the player interacted
      to open the bank. Must be a valid NPC GUID from the database.
  returns: An NPCEvent object representing the bank opening interaction between the
    specified player and NPC. The returned event can be used for further processing
    such as quest updates, logging, or triggering other game events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bank Opening Event Creation
    code: 'NPCEvent event = NPCEvent::BankOpened(12345, 67890);

      // This creates an event indicating player 12345 opened bank with NPC 67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Bank Opening Event in Quest Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerBankInteraction(Player* player, Creature* npc)\n{\n  \
      \  if (player && npc)\n    {\n        NPCEvent event = NPCEvent::BankOpened(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ npc->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n        // Process the event for quest completion\
      \ or logging\n        HandleNPCEvent(event);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's NPC event handling system and should
    be used in conjunction with other event processing mechanisms. The GUIDs passed
    to this method must correspond to valid entries in the database, otherwise the
    resulting event may not behave as expected. This function does not directly interact
    with the database or perform any network operations; it simply constructs an event
    object.
  warnings: Ensure that both playerGuid and npcGuid are valid before calling this
    method. Passing invalid GUIDs may lead to unexpected behavior in event handlers.
    The returned NPCEvent should be processed immediately as some internal state might
    be transient.
