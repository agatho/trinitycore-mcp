  signature: void WorldSession::SetPlayerDataFlagAccount(uint32 dataFlagId, bool on)
documentation:
  brief: Sets or clears a player data flag for the current account.
  description: The SetPlayerDataFlagAccount method is used to enable or disable a
    specific player data flag associated with the current account. This method modifies
    internal account state flags that may affect gameplay behavior, such as enabling/disabling
    certain features, achievements, or restrictions. The dataFlagId parameter specifies
    which flag to modify, and the 'on' parameter determines whether to set (true)
    or clear (false) that flag. This functionality is typically used for managing
    account-level settings or game state modifications that persist across character
    sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: dataFlagId
    description: Unique identifier for the player data flag to be modified. This value
      corresponds to predefined flag constants in the TrinityCore codebase, typically
      defined in account data or player flag related enums.
  - name: 'on'
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to set (true) or clear (false) the
      specified data flag. When true, the flag is enabled; when false, it is disabled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Account-wide Achievement Flag
    code: 'WorldSession* session = ...;

      // Enable a specific achievement flag for this account

      session->SetPlayerDataFlagAccount(12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Account-Level Game Feature
    code: 'WorldSession* session = ...;

      // Disable a feature flag for the current account

      session->SetPlayerDataFlagAccount(67890, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal account data structures and may trigger
    synchronization with the database. It's important to note that flag IDs should
    be validated against known constants to avoid unintended behavior. The method
    operates on account-level data, meaning changes will affect all characters associated
    with the account.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid flag IDs may lead to undefined
    behavior or database corruption. Always ensure that dataFlagId values are valid
    and correspond to existing flags in the TrinityCore system. Changes made through
    this method might not be immediately visible to other sessions until synchronization
    occurs.
