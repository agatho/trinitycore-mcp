  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & GroupCoordinator::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current statistical data of the group coordinator.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the internal
    Statistics object that holds various metrics and performance data related to the
    group coordinator's operations. This includes information such as the number of
    active groups, total members, processing times, and other operational metrics.
    The returned Statistics object is read-only and should not be modified directly.
    This method is typically used for monitoring, debugging, or administrative purposes
    to assess the health and performance of group coordination within the TrinityCore
    server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Statistics object containing current operational
    metrics and data about the group coordinator's activities.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Group Coordinator Statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = groupCoordinator.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Active Groups: " << stats.activeGroups << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Total Members: " << stats.totalMembers << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The Statistics object returned by this method is a snapshot of the current
    state and may not reflect real-time changes. Accessing this data should be thread-safe,
    but modifications to the underlying statistics should be done through appropriate
    synchronization mechanisms if required.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned Statistics reference directly as it's const.
    Any attempt to change its contents will result in compilation errors. Ensure that
    any access to these statistics is properly synchronized if used in a multi-threaded
    context.
