documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming packet to set action bar toggles for the player's character
  description: Handles the client request to modify the state of action bar toggles,
    which control whether certain action bar slots are enabled or disabled. This method
    is part of the character management system in TrinityCore and directly interacts
    with the player's action bar configuration. The packet contains information about
    which toggle states should be updated for the active character. This method typically
    executes during gameplay when a player adjusts their action bar settings through
    UI controls.

  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSetActionBarToggles(WorldPackets::Character::SetActionBarToggles&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process the toggle states from the packet\n    _player->SetActionBarToggles(packet.Toggles);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object is valid and accessible through
    the session context. It directly modifies the player's action bar state without
    requiring additional validation or database persistence since it's a client-initiated
    update.
