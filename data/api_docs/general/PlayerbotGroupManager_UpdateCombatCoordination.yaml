  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: UpdateCombatCoordination
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::UpdateCombatCoordination(PlayerbotGroup &
    group)
documentation:
  brief: Updates combat coordination settings for a specified player bot group.
  description: The UpdateCombatCoordination method synchronizes and applies current
    combat-related configurations to a given player bot group. This includes adjusting
    behavior patterns, positioning strategies, and tactical responses based on the
    group's current combat state. The method ensures that all bots within the group
    maintain consistent coordination during combat scenarios, such as managing aggro
    distribution, positioning for optimal damage output, or executing coordinated
    abilities. It is typically invoked when there are changes in group composition,
    combat status, or tactical requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Reference to the PlayerbotGroup object whose combat coordination
      settings need to be updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PlayerbotGroupManager* groupManager = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();\n\
      PlayerbotGroup& myGroup = groupManager->GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);\nif (myGroup.IsInCombat())\
      \ {\n    groupManager->UpdateCombatCoordination(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the group is actively engaged in combat
    or about to enter combat. Frequent calls during non-combat periods may result
    in unnecessary processing overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group that is not properly initialized or has
    no active bots may lead to undefined behavior or access violations.
