documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell effect applies a specific aura type.
  description: The IsAura method checks if the current spell effect is of a specified
    aura type. This method is commonly used in spell handling and aura management
    systems within TrinityCore to determine how a spell effect should be processed
    or applied. It allows developers to conditionally execute code based on the aura
    type associated with a spell effect, which is crucial for implementing complex
    spell mechanics such as buffs, debuffs, and status effects. The method typically
    operates on the internal aura type enumeration stored within the SpellEffectInfo
    structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell effect corresponds to the specified aura type,
    false otherwise. This boolean value indicates whether the effect should be treated
    as an aura application for game logic processing.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a Spell Effect is a Damage Over Time Aura
    code: "SpellEffectInfo effect;\n// Assume effect has been initialized with a spell\
      \ effect\nif (effect.IsAura(SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_DAMAGE)) {\n    // Handle periodic\
      \ damage aura logic\n    printf(\"This effect applies a periodic damage aura\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Aura Application Logic
    code: "SpellEffectInfo* effect = spell->GetEffect(0);\nif (effect && effect->IsAura(SPELL_AURA_MOD_STEALTH))\
      \ {\n    // Apply stealth-related logic\n    player->SetStealthed(true);\n}\
      \ else if (effect && effect->IsAura(SPELL_AURA_MOD_INVISIBILITY)) {\n    //\
      \ Apply invisibility logic\n    player->SetInvisible(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal aura type constants defined in the TrinityCore
    spell system. Developers should ensure that the aura parameter passed to this
    method corresponds to valid spell aura types as defined in the core codebase.
    The method is typically used during spell effect processing and may be called
    multiple times per spell execution, so performance considerations should be taken
    into account when implementing complex logic based on its return value.
  warnings: The method signature indicates that it takes an integer parameter 'aura',
    but the actual implementation might not match this description. If the method
    is meant to check against a specific aura type, developers must ensure they are
    passing valid aura type constants. Incorrect usage could lead to unexpected behavior
    in spell effect handling and aura application logic.
