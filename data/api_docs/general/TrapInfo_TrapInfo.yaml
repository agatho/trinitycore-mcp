  class: TrapInfo
  method: TrapInfo
  signature: void TrapInfo::TrapInfo(int spell, int last, int pos, int dur)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new trap information object with specified spell, last, position,
    and duration values.
  description: The TrapInfo constructor initializes a trap information structure used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation. This method sets up
    internal state variables representing the trap's spell ID, last trigger time,
    position coordinates, and duration. The trap information is typically used for
    managing trap objects within the game world, tracking their activation status,
    positioning, and expiration times. This constructor is part of the core trap system
    that handles both player-triggered and environmental traps in the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: spell
    description: The spell ID associated with this trap. Represents the specific trap
      spell effect that will be applied when the trap is triggered.
  - name: last
    description: Timestamp or tick count representing the last time the trap was triggered
      or updated.
  - name: pos
    description: Position coordinate indicating where the trap is located in the game
      world (typically X, Y, Z coordinates).
  - name: dur
    description: Duration value specifying how long the trap remains active or how
      much time is left before expiration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trap Initialization
    code: 'TrapInfo trap(12345, 1000, 500, 3000);

      // Creates a trap with spell ID 12345, last trigger at tick 1000,

      // positioned at coordinate 500, with duration of 3000 ticks'
    language: cpp
  - title: Trap Initialization for Environmental Trap
    code: 'TrapInfo* trap = new TrapInfo(25678, GetGameTime(), GetPosition(), 6000);

      // Initializes an environmental trap with current game time as last trigger,

      // using current position and 6 second duration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the trap management system
    when creating new trap objects. The parameters are expected to be validated before
    construction, as invalid values may cause undefined behavior in trap activation
    logic. This method does not perform any network communication or database operations
    directly.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with negative duration values as it may lead
    to incorrect trap expiration handling. Ensure that the spell ID corresponds to
    an actual trap spell defined in the game's spell database, otherwise the trap
    may not function correctly when triggered.
