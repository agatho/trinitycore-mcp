documentation:
  brief: Applies the specified aura effect to all affected targets.
  description: The _ApplyEffectForTargets method is responsible for applying a specific
    aura effect (identified by effIndex) to all current targets of the aura. This
    method is typically called during aura application or update cycles and handles
    the logic for modifying target attributes, triggering effects, or updating game
    state based on the aura's properties. It ensures that the effect is properly propagated
    to all relevant units within the aura's scope.

      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal implementation detail and should not be called
    directly from outside the Aura class. It's typically invoked by the aura system
    during update cycles or when targets are added/removed from the aura's effect
    area.
