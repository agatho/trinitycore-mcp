documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GridMap instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The GridMap destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory and
    resources allocated during the lifetime of a GridMap object. This includes releasing
    any internal data structures that store terrain, height maps, or collision information
    for a specific grid section of the game world. The destructor ensures proper resource
    deallocation to prevent memory leaks when the GridMap object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. In TrinityCore's architecture, GridMaps are dynamically
    created and destroyed as players move through different sections of the world,
    making this destructor an essential part of the memory management system.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of GridMap
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    GridMap* map = new GridMap();\n    // ...\
      \ use the grid map ...\n    delete map; // Triggers ~GridMap destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-allocated GridMap destruction
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    GridMap map; // Stack allocated\n    // ...\
      \ use the grid map ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when map goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GridMap destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope or are explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call
    this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction
    process typically involves freeing internal buffers, clearing cached data, and
    ensuring no dangling pointers remain in the system.
