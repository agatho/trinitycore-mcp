  method: CheckLootRefs
  signature: void LootStore::CheckLootRefs(LootIdSet * ref_set) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates and checks loot reference integrity within the LootStore.
  description: The CheckLootRefs method performs validation on loot references stored
    within a LootStore instance. It ensures that all referenced loot entries are consistent
    and properly defined, identifying any invalid or dangling references. This method
    is typically used during initialization or maintenance of loot systems to prevent
    runtime errors caused by malformed loot data. The method takes a set of reference
    IDs and verifies their existence and correctness within the store's internal structure.
  parameters:
  - name: ref_set
    description: A pointer to a LootIdSet containing the set of reference IDs to validate.
      This parameter should not be null and must contain valid loot reference identifiers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reference Validation
    code: 'LootStore store;

      LootIdSet refs;

      // Populate refs with valid loot IDs

      store.CheckLootRefs(&refs);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload
    operations to ensure loot integrity. It performs internal consistency checks without
    modifying the store's contents.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null ref_set parameter will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that the provided set contains valid
    reference data before calling.
