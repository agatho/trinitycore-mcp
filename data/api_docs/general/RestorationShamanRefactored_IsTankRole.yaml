  method: IsTankRole
  signature: bool RestorationShamanRefactored::IsTankRole(int * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the restoration shaman is assigned to a tank role based
    on unit data.
  description: The IsTankRole method evaluates if the current restoration shaman instance
    is designated as a tank role within the game's combat system. This typically involves
    checking internal state flags or configuration settings that define the player's
    role assignment. The method returns true if the shaman is actively fulfilling
    a tanking function, and false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment,
    this could be relevant for spell selection, cooldown management, or behavior adjustments
    specific to tanking duties.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unit identifier (GUID) of
      the target being evaluated. This parameter is used internally by the method
      to determine role assignment context.
  returns: Returns true if the restoration shaman is assigned to a tank role for the
    specified unit; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check tank role
    code: "int targetGuid = 12345;\nif (shaman.IsTankRole(&targetGuid)) {\n    //\
      \ Perform tank-specific actions\n    printf(\"Shaman is in tank role\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Perform non-tank actions\n    printf(\"Shaman is not in tank\
      \ role\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the shaman's role assignment.
    It may be influenced by group composition, raid settings, or player choice. The
    unit parameter must point to a valid GUID; otherwise behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Ensure that the unit pointer passed to this method points to a valid and
    active unit in the game world. Passing an invalid or null pointer can result in
    undefined behavior or crashes.
