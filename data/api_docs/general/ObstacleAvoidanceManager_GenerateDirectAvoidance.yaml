  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: GenerateDirectAvoidance
  signature: AvoidanceManeuver ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GenerateDirectAvoidance(const
    CollisionPrediction & collision)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a direct avoidance maneuver to prevent collision with obstacles.
  description: The GenerateDirectAvoidance method computes and returns an AvoidanceManeuver
    object that represents a straight-line path adjustment to avoid detected collisions.
    This method is typically invoked during AI pathfinding when obstacle detection
    has identified potential collision hazards. It evaluates the provided collision
    data to determine the most effective direct avoidance strategy, which may include
    adjusting direction or speed to safely navigate around obstacles. The resulting
    maneuver can be applied immediately to modify an NPC's movement behavior in real-time.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AvoidanceManeuver object containing the computed direct avoidance path
    that should be followed to avoid the detected collision. This maneuver includes
    directional adjustments and potentially speed modifications to ensure safe navigation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ObstacleAvoidanceManager* avoidanceMgr = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetAvoidanceManager();\n\
      AvoidanceManeuver maneuver = avoidanceMgr->GenerateDirectAvoidance(collisionData);\n\
      if (maneuver.IsValid()) {\n    // Apply the avoidance maneuver to the unit's\
      \ movement\n    unit->MoveTowards(maneuver.GetDirection(), maneuver.GetSpeed());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that collision data has already been processed and validated.
    The avoidance maneuver returned is intended for immediate application and does
    not account for dynamic changes in the environment after computation. Performance
    may be impacted by complex collision geometries or high-frequency calls.
  warnings: Do not call this method without first ensuring that valid collision data
    exists, as it may produce undefined behavior or invalid maneuvers. The returned
    maneuver should only be applied to units with active movement behaviors; applying
    it to stationary units may cause unexpected results.
