  class: FormationManager
  method: TransitionToCombatFormation
  signature: void FormationManager::TransitionToCombatFormation(const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Transitions the formation manager to a combat-ready state based on the number
    of enemies present.
  description: The TransitionToCombatFormation method adjusts the current formation
    of units managed by the FormationManager to a combat-specific configuration. This
    method is typically invoked when an encounter begins or when enemy presence increases,
    ensuring that the group adopts an appropriate tactical arrangement for battle.
    It takes into account the number of enemies and modifies unit positioning, movement
    patterns, and possibly engagement strategies accordingly. The method does not
    return any value but directly alters the internal state of the FormationManager
    to reflect the new combat formation.
  parameters:
  - name: enemies
    description: An integer reference indicating the number of enemies currently present
      in the combat zone. This value determines how the formation should be adjusted
      for optimal tactical positioning.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Trigger
    code: "void OnCombatStart()\n{\n    int enemyCount = GetEnemyCount();\n    formationManager.TransitionToCombatFormation(enemyCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Formation Adjustment Based on Enemy Count
    code: "void UpdateCombatFormation()\n{\n    int enemies = GetNearbyEnemiesCount();\n\
      \    if (enemies > 0)\n    {\n        formationManager.TransitionToCombatFormation(enemies);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FormationManager has already been initialized
    with valid unit data and that the enemy count passed in is accurate. It may internally
    trigger additional actions such as unit repositioning or behavior updates depending
    on the current formation type.
  warnings: Ensure that the enemy count parameter accurately reflects the number of
    active enemies; incorrect values may lead to improper tactical formations, potentially
    weakening the group's combat effectiveness.
