  method: Deactivate
  signature: void BotAIInitializer::Deactivate()
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the bot AI initializer, stopping all associated AI behavior and
    cleanup operations.
  description: The Deactivate method is responsible for shutting down and cleaning
    up all active AI behaviors managed by the BotAIInitializer. When called, this
    method ensures that any running AI threads, scheduled tasks, or active bot instances
    are properly terminated and resources are released. It typically resets internal
    state flags and may notify other systems within the TrinityCore framework about
    the deactivation event. This method is commonly invoked when bots are removed
    from the game world or when the AI system needs to be temporarily disabled for
    maintenance or shutdown purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Usage
    code: 'BotAIInitializer* initializer = new BotAIInitializer();

      // ... initialize and activate bot AI ...

      initializer->Deactivate(); // Cleanly shuts down all bot AI operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the BotAIInitializer is no longer
    needed or when a clean shutdown is required. It's recommended to ensure that all
    associated bots are properly dismissed before calling Deactivate to avoid potential
    resource leaks.
