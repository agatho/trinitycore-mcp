  brief: Initializes and loads all classic dungeon data for the DungeonBehavior system
  description: The LoadClassicDungeons method is responsible for loading and initializing
    all classic dungeon configurations and data required by the DungeonBehavior system.
    This method typically reads dungeon definitions from database tables or configuration
    files, sets up internal data structures, and prepares the system to handle dungeon-related
    game mechanics such as instance creation, player entry, and quest management.
    The method is usually called during server startup or when the dungeon behavior
    system needs to refresh its data. It ensures that all classic dungeons are properly
    registered and available for use within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.LoadClassicDungeons();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server initialization and should
    only be called once to avoid duplicate data loading. The method may perform database
    queries to fetch dungeon information, so performance considerations should be
    taken into account during server startup.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate dungeon entries. Ensure that any existing dungeon data
    is properly cleared before reloading.
