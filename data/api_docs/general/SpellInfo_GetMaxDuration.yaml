  method: GetMaxDuration
  signature: int32 SpellInfo::GetMaxDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum duration in seconds of the spell.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum duration value for a spell, which
    represents the longest possible duration that the spell can last. The returned
    value is typically used in conjunction with other spell parameters to determine
    how long a spell effect will persist, particularly for spells that have time-based
    effects or are subject to duration limits. This value is often tied to the spell's
    base duration and may be influenced by factors such as talent bonuses, item enchantments,
    or other game mechanics that affect spell duration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the maximum duration in seconds of
    the spell. A value of 0 indicates that the spell has no duration limit or is instantaneous,
    while positive values indicate a finite duration that can be affected by various
    modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 maxDuration = spellInfo->GetMaxDuration();\nif (maxDuration > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Spell has a finite duration\n    printf(\"Spell duration: %d seconds\\\
      n\", maxDuration);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Spell is instantaneous or has no duration\
      \ limit\n    printf(\"Spell is instant or has no duration\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell processing logic where the actual duration
    of a spell needs to be calculated based on base duration and modifiers. It should
    be noted that this value may not always reflect the final effective duration due
    to additional factors like talent bonuses or item effects.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns the maximum duration, which might differ
    from the actual duration used in gameplay calculations. Some spells may have different
    durations based on their specific mechanics and modifiers applied during runtime.
