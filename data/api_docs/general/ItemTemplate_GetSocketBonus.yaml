documentation:
  brief: Returns the socket bonus ID associated with the item template.
  description: The GetSocketBonus method retrieves the socket bonus identifier for
    the item template. In World of Warcraft, socket bonuses are special effects that
    activate when gems are inserted into gem sockets on an item. This ID corresponds
    to a specific SocketBonusEntry in the game's database, which defines the bonus
    effect applied when the sockets are filled. The method is typically used during
    item creation, evaluation of gem combinations, or when calculating item stats
    and bonuses. It serves as a lookup key to determine what bonus effects should
    be active for an item with socketed gems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the socket bonus ID. A value of 0 typically
    indicates no socket bonus is defined for this item template, while non-zero values
    correspond to entries in the SocketBonus.dbc database file that define the actual
    bonus effects.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an item has a socket bonus
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate->GetSocketBonus()\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Item has socket bonus ID: %u\\n\", itemTemplate->GetSocketBonus());\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Item has no socket bonus\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using socket bonus to apply effects in custom code
    code: "uint32 socketBonusId = itemTemplate->GetSocketBonus();\nif (socketBonusId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Lookup the actual bonus effect from SocketBonus.dbc\n    SocketBonusEntry\
      \ const* socketBonus = sSocketBonusStore.LookupEntry(socketBonusId);\n    if\
      \ (socketBonus)\n    {\n        // Apply the bonus effects to player or item\n\
      \        // Implementation depends on specific game mechanics\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns a cached value from the item
    template. The socket bonus ID should correspond to valid entries in the SocketBonus.dbc
    file. Performance-wise, this is a fast operation as it only returns a stored integer
    value without any complex calculations or database lookups.
  warnings: Be aware that a return value of 0 does not necessarily mean an error condition;
    it simply means no socket bonus is defined for the item template. Always validate
    against 0 before attempting to use the returned ID to avoid invalid lookups in
    the SocketBonus.dbc file.
