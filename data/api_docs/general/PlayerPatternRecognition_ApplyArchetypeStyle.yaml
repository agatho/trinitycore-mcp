  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: ApplyArchetypeStyle
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::ApplyArchetypeStyle(Player * bot, PlayerArchetype
    archetype)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a specified archetype style to a player bot, modifying its behavior
    and attributes according to the archetype's configuration.
  description: The ApplyArchetypeStyle method is used to assign a specific PlayerArchetype
    to a given Player bot. This operation modifies the bot's gameplay characteristics,
    such as abilities, stats, and behavior patterns, based on the rules defined for
    that archetype. The method ensures that all relevant systems are updated to reflect
    the new archetype configuration. It is typically invoked during bot initialization
    or when dynamically switching archetypes during gameplay. The function does not
    return any value but directly alters the state of the provided player object.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose archetype
      style will be applied. Must not be null.
  - name: archetype
    description: An enum value of type PlayerArchetype that specifies which predefined
      archetype configuration should be applied to the bot. Valid values are defined
      in the PlayerArchetype enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer

      ApplyArchetypeStyle(myBot, PLAYER_ARCHETYPE_WARRIOR);

      // The bot now has warrior-specific stats and abilities.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Archetype Switching
    code: "Player* targetBot = ...;\nif (someCondition)\n{\n    ApplyArchetypeStyle(targetBot,\
      \ PLAYER_ARCHETYPE_MAGE);\n}\nelse\n{\n    ApplyArchetypeStyle(targetBot, PLAYER_ARCHETYPE_ROGUE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player object is a valid bot instance
    and not a real player. The archetype configurations must be properly initialized
    before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior. Performance-wise, this
    operation should be lightweight as it primarily involves updating internal state
    variables.
  warnings: Do not pass a null pointer for the 'bot' parameter; doing so may cause
    a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the PlayerArchetype enum value passed
    is valid and corresponds to an existing archetype definition in the system.
