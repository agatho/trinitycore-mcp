  signature: void Player::UpdateSoulboundTradeItems()
documentation:
  brief: Updates soulbound trade items for the player, ensuring proper handling of
    items that cannot be traded or sold.
  description: The UpdateSoulboundTradeItems method processes all soulbound items
    currently in the player's inventory and updates their trade status. Soulbound
    items are those that cannot be traded, sold to other players, or transferred between
    characters. This method ensures that such items are properly marked and handled
    within the game's trading system. It typically gets invoked during player logout
    or when item states change to prevent invalid trades. The method does not return
    any value but modifies internal item state flags and inventory data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Player Logout
    code: "void Player::OnLogout()\n{\n    UpdateSoulboundTradeItems();\n    // Other\
      \ logout logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core system during critical
    state transitions like logout or when items are modified. Developers should not
    generally call this directly unless implementing custom item handling logic.
  warnings: Calling this method manually outside of its intended context may result
    in inconsistent item states or unexpected behavior in the trading system.
