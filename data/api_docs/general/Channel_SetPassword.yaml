api:
  class: Channel
  method: SetPassword
  signature: void Channel::SetPassword(const std::string & password)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the password for the channel, securing it from unauthorized access.
  description: The SetPassword method assigns a password to the channel, which is
    required for users to join or speak in password-protected channels. This method
    updates the internal password field of the channel object and ensures that subsequent
    join attempts must provide the correct password. The password is stored securely
    within the channel's data structure and is used during authentication checks when
    players attempt to interact with the channel. This functionality supports the
    game's communication system by allowing guilds, groups, or players to create private
    chat channels.
  parameters:
  - name: password
    description: The new password string to set for the channel. Must be a valid UTF-8
      encoded string with length between 1 and 128 characters. Empty strings are allowed
      but will effectively remove password protection if previously set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Channel Password
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChatHandler->GetPlayerChannel(player);

      channel->SetPassword("MySecretPass123");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Channel Password
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChatHandler->GetPlayerChannel(player);

      channel->SetPassword(""); // Removes password protection'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not broadcast the password change to channel members; it
    only updates the internal state. The actual enforcement of password requirements
    occurs during join and speak operations through separate authentication mechanisms.
  warnings: Setting an empty password will remove all password protection from the
    channel, potentially exposing private conversations. Ensure that passwords are
    properly validated before setting them to avoid security vulnerabilities.
