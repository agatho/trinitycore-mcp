documentation:
  brief: Assigns the state and resources of one BotLifecycleManager instance to another
  description: The assignment operator for BotLifecycleManager performs a deep copy
    of all member variables from the source object to the target object. This method
    ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of internal data structures,
    preventing shared references that could lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption.
    In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this operation is crucial when transferring
    bot lifecycle management responsibilities between different instances or when
    resetting a manager's state during runtime.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotLifecycleManager object whose state will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current BotLifecycleManager instance (this) after the
    assignment has been completed, enabling chained assignments
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'BotLifecycleManager manager1;

      BotLifecycleManager manager2 = manager1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      manager2 = manager1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotLifecycleManager mgrA, mgrB, mgrC;

      // Chaining assignments

      mgrA = mgrB = mgrC; // All managers get the state of mgrC'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements deep copying to avoid dangling pointers or
    resource sharing. The implementation should handle potential memory allocation
    failures gracefully and ensure thread safety if multiple threads access manager
    instances concurrently.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning managers that contain active bot references,
    as this may cause unexpected behavior if the source and destination managers manage
    different sets of bots. Ensure proper synchronization if used in multithreaded
    environments.
