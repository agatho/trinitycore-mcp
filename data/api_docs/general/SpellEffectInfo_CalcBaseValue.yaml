  class: SpellEffectInfo
  method: CalcBaseValue
  signature: int32 SpellEffectInfo::CalcBaseValue(const WorldObject * caster, const
    Unit * target, uint32 itemId, int32 itemLevel) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the base value of a spell effect based on caster, target, item,
    and item level parameters.
  description: The CalcBaseValue method computes the base numerical value for a spell
    effect in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore engine. This calculation takes into
    account various factors including the casting unit, target unit, an optional item
    identifier, and the item's level to determine the effective base damage or healing
    amount. The method is typically used during spell execution to dynamically calculate
    effect values that may vary based on game state, equipment, or other contextual
    factors. It serves as a core component in determining how powerful a spell effect
    will be when applied to targets.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is casting the spell. This can be
      a Unit (player, NPC) or GameObject. Must not be null for valid calculations.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Unit of the spell effect. May be null if the
      effect does not require a direct target.
  - name: itemId
    description: Identifier of an item that may influence the spell effect calculation.
      Set to 0 if no item is involved in the effect.
  - name: itemLevel
    description: The level or quality level of the item influencing the effect. Should
      be 0 if itemId is not specified.
  returns: Returns an int32 representing the calculated base value for the spell effect.
    This value may represent damage, healing, or other numerical effects depending
    on the spell type and context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with player caster
    code: 'SpellEffectInfo effect;

      Unit* caster = player;

      Unit* target = enemy;

      int32 baseValue = effect.CalcBaseValue(caster, target, 0, 0);

      // baseValue now contains the computed base effect value'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with item influence
    code: 'SpellEffectInfo effect;

      Unit* caster = player;

      Unit* target = enemy;

      uint32 itemId = 12345; // Example enchanted weapon

      int32 itemLevel = 50;

      int32 baseValue = effect.CalcBaseValue(caster, target, itemId, itemLevel);

      // baseValue adjusted for item properties and level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell system's internal logic and is usually invoked
    during spell processing rather than being called directly by external code. The
    actual implementation may involve complex calculations involving spell modifiers,
    talent effects, buffs, debuffs, and item stats. It's important to note that this
    function does not apply any randomization or scaling beyond base calculation.
  warnings: Ensure the caster parameter is valid before calling this method; passing
    a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. The itemId
    and itemLevel parameters should be validated if they are derived from user input
    or external sources to prevent incorrect spell effect calculations.
