  class: DPSPositioning
  method: CalculateCleaveDPSPosition
  signature: int DPSPositioning::CalculateCleaveDPSPosition(Player * dps, const int
    & targets)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal positioning for a DPS player to maximize cleave damage
    output based on target count.
  description: The CalculateCleaveDPSPosition method determines the ideal position
    for a Damage Per Second (DPS) player within a group or raid environment when engaging
    multiple targets. This calculation takes into account factors such as the number
    of enemies present, the player's weapon range, and the positioning of nearby allies
    to ensure maximum damage efficiency through cleave abilities. The method is typically
    used by AI systems or automated positioning tools to guide players during combat
    encounters. It assumes that the player is capable of using cleave-based attacks
    and that the environment allows for optimal positioning without obstruction.
  parameters:
  - name: dps
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the DPS character whose
      positioning is being calculated.
  - name: targets
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the number of targets currently
      engaged in combat. This value must be a positive integer greater than zero.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal cleave positioning
    index. A return value of 0 typically indicates the center position, while positive
    and negative values may indicate positions to the left or right respectively,
    based on internal logic. The exact meaning of each returned value depends on how
    the system interprets positional data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* myDPS = ...; // Assume initialized player object

      int targetCount = 5;

      int position = DPSPositioning::CalculateCleaveDPSPosition(myDPS, targetCount);

      // Use ''position'' to determine optimal cleave stance or movement'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with dynamic targeting
    code: "void UpdateDPSPosition(Player* player) {\n    int currentTargets = GetNearbyEnemies(player);\n\
      \    if (currentTargets > 0) {\n        int optimalPosition = DPSPositioning::CalculateCleaveDPSPosition(player,\
      \ currentTargets);\n        MoveToPosition(player, optimalPosition);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal game mechanics related to attack range and
    cleave radius. It may vary depending on the specific class and talents of the
    player. The calculation does not account for environmental obstacles or complex
    terrain that might affect positioning in real-time combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'dps' parameter is a valid pointer to an initialized Player
    object; otherwise, calling this method will result in undefined behavior. Also,
    the number of targets should be validated before passing to avoid incorrect positioning
    calculations.
