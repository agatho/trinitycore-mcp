  class: SmartGameObjectAI
  method: OnReportUse
  signature: bool SmartGameObjectAI::OnReportUse(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player reports using a smart game object, returning
    true if the action was successfully processed.
  description: The OnReportUse method is invoked when a player interacts with a smart
    game object, typically after using it in some way. This method serves as part
    of the SmartAI system's event handling mechanism, allowing for custom behavior
    to be executed upon player interaction. It processes the use report and returns
    a boolean value indicating whether the operation was handled successfully. The
    method is commonly used within the context of quest triggers, interactive objects,
    or scripted events where specific actions need to occur when a player interacts
    with a game object.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that triggered the use report. This
      parameter represents the player who interacted with the smart game object and
      is essential for determining context and applying appropriate actions.
  returns: Returns true if the use report was successfully processed by the smart
    AI system, otherwise false. A return value of true typically indicates that the
    interaction was handled as expected and any associated events or quest updates
    were triggered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom smart AI implementation
    code: "class MySmartGameObjectAI : public SmartGameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    bool\
      \ OnReportUse(Player* player) override {\n        // Custom logic when player\
      \ uses the object\n        if (player->HasQuest(QUEST_ID)) {\n            player->CompleteQuest(QUEST_ID);\n\
      \            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple conditions and logging
    code: "bool SmartGameObjectAI::OnReportUse(Player* player) {\n    if (!player\
      \ || !player->IsInWorld())\n        return false;\n\n    // Log the event\n\
      \    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Player %u reported use of GameObject\
      \ %u\", player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), GetObject()->GetEntry());\n\n    //\
      \ Trigger quest completion or other events\n    if (player->GetQuestStatus(QUEST_ID)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE) {\n        player->CompleteQuest(QUEST_ID);\n\
      \        return true;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI framework and integrates with TrinityCore's
    quest system and event handling. It should be overridden in custom AI implementations
    to provide specific behavior for game object interactions. The method is called
    from within the core game loop, so performance considerations are important for
    frequently used objects.
  warnings: Ensure that all pointers passed to this method are valid before dereferencing
    them. Improper handling of player or object references can lead to crashes or
    undefined behavior. Also, be cautious about modifying quest states or player data
    directly within this method without proper synchronization.
