  class: Cell
  method: CalculateCellArea
  signature: CellArea Cell::CalculateCellArea(float x, float y, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the cell area encompassing a given position and radius for spatial
    partitioning in the game world.
  description: The CalculateCellArea method determines the boundaries of a cell region
    based on a specified world coordinate and radius. This function is essential for
    determining which cells in the grid-based spatial partitioning system contain
    objects or areas of interest. It's commonly used for object visibility calculations,
    collision detection, and efficient query processing within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method takes into account the game world's cell size configuration to ensure
    accurate spatial indexing.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the center point in world space
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the center point in world space
  - name: radius
    description: The radius defining the area around the center point to calculate
      cell boundaries for
  returns: A CellArea structure containing the calculated minimum and maximum cell
    coordinates that encompass the specified area
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating cell area around player position
    code: 'float playerX = 1234.5f;

      float playerY = 6789.0f;

      float visibilityRadius = 50.0f;

      CellArea area = CalculateCellArea(playerX, playerY, visibilityRadius);

      // Use area to determine which cells need to be checked for object visibility'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using calculated cell area for zone-based processing
    code: "float objectX = 1000.0f;\nfloat objectY = 2000.0f;\nfloat searchRadius\
      \ = 100.0f;\nCellArea area = CalculateCellArea(objectX, objectY, searchRadius);\n\
      for (int cx = area.minX; cx <= area.maxX; ++cx)\n{\n    for (int cy = area.minY;\
      \ cy <= area.maxY; ++cy)\n    {\n        // Process objects in cell (cx, cy)\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes a fixed cell size configuration typically defined by
    the game world's grid system. The implementation uses integer-based calculations
    to map floating-point coordinates to discrete cell indices. Performance is optimized
    for frequent calls during object placement and visibility updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the radius parameter does not exceed reasonable bounds to
    prevent excessive cell calculations. Be aware that very small radii may result
    in minimal cell coverage, potentially causing performance issues with edge case
    handling.
