documentation:
  brief: Calculates the efficiency of a group formation based on member count and
    formation type
  description: The CalculateFormationEfficiency method computes a float value representing
    how effectively a group of members can be organized according to a specified formation
    type. This utility is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    for determining optimal group configurations, such as for raid compositions, battleground
    formations, or quest groupings. The efficiency score typically ranges from 0.0
    (inefficient) to 1.0 (optimal), though exact bounds may vary based on implementation
    details. The method considers both the number of members and the formation type
    to determine a normalized efficiency value that can be used for AI decision-making,
    player guidance, or performance optimization.
  parameters:
  - name: members
    description: The number of group members in the formation. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing valid group size.
  - name: formation
    description: The FormationType enum value specifying the type of formation to
      evaluate. This determines how the efficiency is calculated based on tactical
      or gameplay requirements.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the calculated efficiency
    of the given formation. Lower values indicate less efficient formations, while
    higher values suggest more optimal configurations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float efficiency = FormationUtils::CalculateFormationEfficiency(5, FormationType::LINE);
    language: cpp
  - title: Efficiency Check for Raid Formation
    code: "int raidMembers = 25;\nFormationType raidFormation = FormationType::CIRCLE;\n\
      float efficiency = FormationUtils::CalculateFormationEfficiency(raidMembers,\
      \ raidFormation);\nif (efficiency > 0.8f) {\n    // Optimal raid formation\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's group management and
    AI systems to optimize player positioning and combat effectiveness. The exact
    calculation logic may depend on internal constants or configuration values that
    are not exposed in the public API.
  warnings: Ensure that the FormationType enum value passed is valid, as invalid values
    might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect efficiency calculations. The method
    assumes valid inputs for members count and formation type.
