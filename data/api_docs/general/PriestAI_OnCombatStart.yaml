documentation:
  brief: Initializes priest AI behavior when entering combat with a target
  description: The OnCombatStart method is called when a Priest AI mob enters combat
    mode. This method sets up the initial combat state for the priest, including selecting
    appropriate spells, initializing combat timers, and preparing the AI to execute
    priest-specific abilities such as healing, damage spells, or utility effects.
    The method typically configures the AI's target selection logic and prepares the
    spell casting behavior based on the current combat situation and priest class
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the integer representing the target's identifier in combat.
      This parameter is used to initialize the AI's target tracking system for spell
      targeting and combat decision making.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Priest AI Combat Initialization
    code: "void PriestAI::OnCombatStart(int* target)\n{\n    if (target && *target\
      \ != 0)\n    {\n        // Set initial target for the priest\n        me->SetTarget(*target);\n\
      \        // Initialize combat timers and spell selection\n        _combatTimer\
      \ = 1000;\n        _spellCooldown = 2000;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore AI system
    when a priest mob enters combat. Developers should ensure that any custom implementation
    properly initializes all necessary AI state variables and does not interfere with
    core combat mechanics.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless implementing a custom AI behavior.
    The method assumes valid target data and may cause undefined behavior if passed
    an invalid or null pointer.
