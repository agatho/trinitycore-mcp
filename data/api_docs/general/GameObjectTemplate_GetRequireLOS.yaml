documentation:
  brief: Returns the line-of-sight requirement flag for the game object template.
  description: The GetRequireLOS method retrieves the line-of-sight requirement setting
    for a game object template. This flag determines whether players must have a clear
    line of sight to interact with the game object. A value of 0 typically means no
    line-of-sight requirement, while a non-zero value indicates that the player must
    be able to see the object directly. This is commonly used for interactive objects
    like doors, levers, or quest items where visual confirmation of interaction is
    required. The method provides access to a cached value from the database entry
    for the game object template.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the line-of-sight requirement flag.
    A value of 0 means no line-of-sight check is required, while any non-zero value
    indicates that the player must have direct visual access to the object before
    interaction can occur.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a game object requires line-of-sight
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate)\n{\n    uint32 requireLOS = goTemplate->GetRequireLOS();\n \
      \   if (requireLOS != 0)\n    {\n        // Interaction requires line-of-sight\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Game object requires line-of-sight for interaction.\"\
      );\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // No line-of-sight requirement\n      \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Game object does not require line-of-sight for interaction.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method accesses a cached value from the GameObjectTemplate's internal
    data structure. The actual value is loaded from the gameobject_template database
    table during server startup or when templates are loaded. This is a read-only
    accessor and does not modify any state.
