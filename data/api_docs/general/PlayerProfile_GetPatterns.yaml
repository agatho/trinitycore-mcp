  class: PlayerProfile
  method: GetPatterns
  signature: int PlayerProfile::GetPatterns(PatternType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of patterns known by the player profile for a specified
    pattern type.
  description: The GetPatterns method returns the count of patterns that a player
    has learned or discovered within a specific category. This method is typically
    used in the context of professions, crafting, or skill systems where players can
    acquire and store various patterns. The returned value represents how many distinct
    patterns of the given type are available to the player. It's important to note
    that this method does not return the actual patterns themselves but rather their
    count, which can be useful for UI display, progress tracking, or conditional logic
    based on pattern acquisition.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of patterns known for the specified
    PatternType. Returns 0 if no patterns are found or if the player profile is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Alchemy Patterns
    code: "PlayerProfile* profile = player->GetPlayerProfile();\nint alchemyPatterns\
      \ = profile->GetPatterns(PatternType::ALCHEMY);\nif (alchemyPatterns > 0) {\n\
      \    // Player has learned some alchemy patterns\n    std::cout << \"Player\
      \ knows \" << alchemyPatterns << \" alchemy patterns\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented as a constant function, meaning it does
    not modify the state of the PlayerProfile object. It may internally iterate through
    stored pattern data or access cached counts for performance reasons. The PatternType
    parameter should be validated before calling to ensure correct behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the PlayerProfile object is valid and initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing an invalid profile could lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, be aware that pattern counts might not reflect real-time updates if caching
    is involved.
