documentation:
  brief: Returns the map entry data for the current map instance
  description: The GetEntry method retrieves the MapEntry structure associated with
    the current map. This structure contains essential information about the map such
    as its ID, name, type, and other properties that define how the map behaves within
    the game world. The method is commonly used in game logic to access map-specific
    data during gameplay operations, particularly when dealing with zone-based mechanics
    or map-related calculations. It ensures that developers can accurately reference
    map characteristics without having to manually lookup map data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the MapEntry structure which contains all relevant
    information about the current map, including its ID, name, type, and other properties.
    The returned pointer may be null if the map entry is not found or properly initialized,
    though this should not occur in normal operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "MapEntry const* entry = map->GetEntry();\nif (entry)\n{\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Map name: \" << entry->name << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "MapEntry const* entry = map->GetEntry();\nif (entry && entry->mapId ==\
      \ 123)\n{\n    // Perform actions based on map ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. Performance
    considerations are minimal as the method simply returns a pointer to pre-existing
    data structure.
