documentation:
  brief: Activates or deactivates PvP item levels for the player.
  description: This method toggles the PvP item level activation state for the player,
    allowing them to either enable or disable PvP gear progression. When activated,
    players can access higher-level PvP items that are typically restricted to PvP
    content. The method affects the player's ability to use PvP gear and may influence
    their character's progression in PvP activities such as battlegrounds and arenas.
    This functionality is crucial for players who wish to participate in PvP content
    without being limited by item level restrictions.

  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other PvP-related functions
    and may affect how players interact with PvP content. It's recommended to use
    this method during character initialization or when transitioning between PvP
    and PvE content.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in PvP gear
    progression, potentially causing issues with item level restrictions or access
    to PvP content. Care should be taken when applying this function to ensure proper
    synchronization with game mechanics.
