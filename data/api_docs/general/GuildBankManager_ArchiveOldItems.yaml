  class: GuildBankManager
  method: ArchiveOldItems
  signature: void GuildBankManager::ArchiveOldItems(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Archives old guild bank items that have exceeded their retention period.
  description: The ArchiveOldItems method processes the guild bank inventory to identify
    and archive items that have surpassed their configured time-based retention limit.
    This functionality is typically used during periodic maintenance or when a guild's
    bank settings are updated to enforce item lifecycle management. The method iterates
    through all guild bank tabs and items, checking each item's age against the defined
    threshold, and moves eligible items to an archival storage location within the
    guild bank system. This process helps maintain organized inventory management
    by automatically handling obsolete or expired items.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to a player identifier used for context in the archiving
      process. The method may use this parameter to determine which player initiated
      the operation or to track archival actions for audit purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GuildBankManager bankManager;

      int playerId = 12345;

      bankManager.ArchiveOldItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database operations to update item statuses and
    may trigger notifications to guild members about archived items. It should be
    called during maintenance windows or as part of automated systems to avoid performance
    impact during peak gameplay times.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player pointer could lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure the player parameter points to a valid, initialized player object
    before invocation.
