  brief: Cancel the global cooldown associated with the spell
  description: This method removes the global cooldown (GCD) that is currently applied
    to the spell, allowing the player to immediately cast another spell without waiting
    for the cooldown period to expire. The global cooldown is a mechanism that prevents
    players from casting spells too rapidly and ensures balanced gameplay. This method
    specifically targets the GCD associated with the current spell instance, not other
    spells or abilities.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->CancelGlobalCooldown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to manage cooldowns and ensure proper gameplay balance. It should be called only
    when the spell's GCD needs to be removed, such as during certain abilities or
    effects that override the normal cooldown behavior.
