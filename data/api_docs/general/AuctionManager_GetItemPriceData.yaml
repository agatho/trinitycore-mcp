documentation:
  brief: Retrieves pricing data for a specified item from the auction house system
  description: The GetItemPriceData method fetches comprehensive pricing information
    for a given item ID within the auction house system. This includes historical
    price trends, current market values, and statistical data that helps determine
    fair pricing for auctions. The method operates on the auction manager's internal
    database of item pricing information and returns structured data about the item's
    value over time. It is commonly used by auction house systems to provide accurate
    pricing recommendations and to maintain market balance within the game economy.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ItemPriceData structure containing detailed pricing information for
    the specified item, including average prices, minimum/maximum values, and historical
    trends. Returns an empty or default-initialized structure if no pricing data exists
    for the given item ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display item price data
    code: "ItemPriceData priceData = auctionMgr->GetItemPriceData(12345);\nif (priceData.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Average Price: \" << priceData.GetAveragePrice() <<\
      \ std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Min Price: \" << priceData.GetMinPrice() <<\
      \ std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Max Price: \" << priceData.GetMaxPrice() <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database lookups and may have performance implications
    when called frequently. The returned data is cached internally to improve performance
    for repeated queries on the same item. The ItemPriceData structure should be checked
    for validity before accessing its members to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent item ID may return
    default/empty pricing data that could lead to incorrect auction pricing decisions
    if not properly validated. Ensure proper error handling when using the returned
    data in auction creation or pricing algorithms.
