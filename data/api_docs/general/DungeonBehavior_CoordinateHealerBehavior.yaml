    DungeonEncounter & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates healer behavior during dungeon encounters by managing healing
    assignments and priorities.
  description: The CoordinateHealerBehavior method is responsible for orchestrating
    how healers behave within a dungeon encounter. It evaluates the current state
    of the encounter, identifies the most critical targets requiring healing, and
    assigns appropriate healing priorities to player healers. This method ensures
    that healers focus on the most urgent threats while maintaining optimal group
    survivability during challenging encounters. The behavior is typically invoked
    during dynamic dungeon scenarios where healer coordination is essential for success.
  parameters:
  - name: healer
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the healer whose behavior
      is being coordinated. Must be a valid player instance with healing capabilities.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object that defines the current
      encounter state, including active enemies, health statuses, and encounter-specific
      rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic healer coordination in dungeon encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnEncounterStart(Player* healer, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.CoordinateHealerBehavior(healer, encounter);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced healer behavior with custom priority logic
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnEncounterUpdate(Player* healer, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    if (encounter.GetPhase() == PHASE_CRITICAL)\n    {\n  \
      \      // Override default behavior for critical phase\n        healer->SetHealingTarget(encounter.GetHighestThreatTarget());\n\
      \    }\n    dungeonBehavior.CoordinateHealerBehavior(healer, encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during encounter events and relies on the
    DungeonEncounter object to provide accurate targeting information. The behavior
    may adjust based on healer class, available mana, and group composition. Performance
    is optimized through caching of target priorities.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null or invalid reference will result in undefined behavior. The encounter
    object must be properly initialized to avoid incorrect healing assignments.
