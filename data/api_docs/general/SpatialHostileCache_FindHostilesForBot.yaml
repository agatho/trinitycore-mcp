  class: SpatialHostileCache
  method: FindHostilesForBot
  signature: int SpatialHostileCache::FindHostilesForBot(Player * bot, float range,
    uint32 maxResults)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the count of hostile units within a specified range for
    a given bot player.
  description: The FindHostilesForBot method searches for all hostile units (such
    as enemies or aggro targets) that are within a defined range of the provided bot
    player. It is typically used in AI logic to determine nearby threats or targets
    for combat decisions. The method utilizes spatial indexing and caching mechanisms
    to efficiently locate these hostiles without performing expensive full-world scans.
    This function is essential for bots to make informed decisions about movement,
    attack priority, and threat avoidance. The maximum number of results returned
    can be limited by the maxResults parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which hostiles
      are being searched. Must not be null.
  - name: range
    description: Float value specifying the maximum distance (in yards) from the bot's
      position to consider for hostile units. Must be positive.
  - name: maxResults
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the maximum number of hostile
      units to return. If set to 0, all matching hostiles within range will be returned
      (up to system limits).
  returns: An integer representing the total count of hostile units found within the
    specified range for the given bot player. Returns zero if no hostiles are found
    or if invalid parameters are passed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearby enemies
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nint hostileCount = SpatialHostileCache::FindHostilesForBot(myBot,\
      \ 30.0f, 5);\nif (hostileCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process the found hostiles\n\
      \    printf(\"Found %d hostiles within 30 yards\\n\", hostileCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Find all nearby enemies without limit
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player

      int hostileCount = SpatialHostileCache::FindHostilesForBot(myBot, 50.0f, 0);

      // Returns count of all hostiles within 50 yards

      printf("Total hostiles in range: %d\n", hostileCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on spatial indexing and caching for performance optimization.
    The actual list of hostiles may be stored internally and retrieved via other methods
    like GetHostilesForBot(). Ensure that the bot player is valid and in a valid game
    state before calling this function to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Passing null as the 'bot' parameter will likely cause a crash or undefined
    behavior. The range should be positive; negative values may lead to incorrect
    results or errors. Be cautious when using large maxResults values, as it could
    impact performance in high-density areas.
