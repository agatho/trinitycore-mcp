  method: CreateBattlefieldsForMap
  signature: void BattlefieldMgr::CreateBattlefieldsForMap(Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and creates battlefield objects for a given map.
  description: The CreateBattlefieldsForMap method is responsible for setting up all
    battlefield instances associated with a specific game map. This method is typically
    invoked during map loading or initialization to ensure that battlefield systems
    are properly registered and ready for player interaction. It iterates through
    the configured battlefield templates for the specified map and creates corresponding
    battlefield objects, which are then managed by the BattlefieldMgr singleton. The
    method ensures that all battlefield-related game mechanics, such as capture points,
    objectives, and player participation rules, are initialized correctly for the
    given map context.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object for which battlefields need to be created.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid map instance within
      the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Map Initialization
    code: "void InitializeMapBattlefields(Map* map)\n{\n    sBattlefieldMgr->CreateBattlefieldsForMap(map);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Custom Map Loading Logic
    code: "class MyMapLoader\n{\npublic:\n    void LoadCustomMap(uint32 mapId)\n \
      \   {\n        Map* map = sMapMgr->CreateMap(mapId, nullptr);\n        if (map)\n\
      \        {\n            sBattlefieldMgr->CreateBattlefieldsForMap(map);\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    map loading. Developers should not normally call this method directly unless implementing
    custom battlefield systems or extending existing map behavior. The method assumes
    that the map object passed has valid battlefield template configurations defined
    in the database.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the map parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure the map object is fully initialized and contains
    valid battlefield data before calling this method.
