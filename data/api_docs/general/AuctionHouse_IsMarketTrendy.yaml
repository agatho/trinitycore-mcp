api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: IsMarketTrendy
  signature: bool AuctionHouse::IsMarketTrendy(uint32 itemId, bool & isRising)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific item is currently experiencing rising market
    trends in the auction house.
  description: The IsMarketTrendy method evaluates the current market behavior of
    a specified item within the auction house system. It analyzes recent bidding activity,
    purchase frequency, and price fluctuations to determine if the item's demand is
    increasing. The method returns true if the item shows rising market trends, and
    false otherwise. The second parameter 'isRising' is set to true if the trend is
    upward, or false if it's downward or neutral. This functionality is typically
    used by the auction house system to provide dynamic feedback to players about
    market conditions for specific items.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to check for market trends. Must
      correspond to a valid item in the game's item database.
  - name: isRising
    description: Output parameter that indicates whether the trend is rising (true)
      or not (false). This value is set by the method based on its analysis of market
      data.
  returns: Returns true if the item is currently showing a rising market trend, false
    otherwise. The actual trend direction is also communicated through the 'isRising'
    output parameter.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 itemId = 12345;\nbool isRising = false;\nif (auctionHouse->IsMarketTrendy(itemId,\
      \ isRising)) {\n    if (isRising) {\n        // Item is gaining popularity\n\
      \        printf(\"Item %u is trending upward\\n\", itemId);\n    } else {\n\
      \        // Item is losing popularity\n        printf(\"Item %u is trending\
      \ downward\\n\", itemId);\n    }\n} else {\n    // No trend data available for\
      \ item\n    printf(\"No trend data for item %u\\n\", itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking of auction house transactions
    and may have performance implications if called frequently. The implementation
    probably uses a rolling time window to analyze recent market activity rather than
    historical data. The accuracy of trend detection depends on sufficient transaction
    volume for the item.
  warnings: The method may return false for items with insufficient market activity
    or very new items that haven't had enough transactions to establish a trend. Developers
    should not assume that a false result means an item is declining in value, only
    that there isn't enough data to determine a trend.
