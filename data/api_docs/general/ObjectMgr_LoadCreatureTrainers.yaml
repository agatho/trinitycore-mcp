  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadCreatureTrainers()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes creature trainer data from the database for all creatures
    that serve as trainers.
  description: The LoadCreatureTrainers method is responsible for loading trainer
    information for all creatures in the game world that are designated as trainers.
    This includes skills, spells, and other training-related data that NPCs provide
    to players. The method typically runs during server startup or when the object
    manager refreshes its internal data structures. It retrieves data from the database
    tables containing creature trainer information and populates internal caches for
    efficient access during gameplay. This ensures that when a player interacts with
    a trainer NPC, the correct training options are available.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadObjectMgr()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadCreatureTrainers();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or database
    reload operations. It's important to note that this method may be invoked multiple
    times if the object manager is refreshed, so it should handle duplicate loading
    gracefully. The method relies on proper database schema structure for creature
    trainers and may throw exceptions if required tables are missing or malformed.
  warnings: This method modifies internal caches and should not be called from within
    active game loops or concurrent threads without proper synchronization. Improper
    handling of database connections during this operation can lead to data corruption
    or incomplete trainer data loading.
