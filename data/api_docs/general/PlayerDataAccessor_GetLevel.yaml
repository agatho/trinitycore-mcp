documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current level of the player character
  description: The GetLevel method returns the integer value representing the current
    experience level of the player character. This value typically ranges from 1 to
    the maximum level allowed by the game server configuration, which is usually 80
    for most World of Warcraft servers. The returned level value is read-only and
    reflects the player's progression through the game's leveling system. This method
    is commonly used in various game systems including quest tracking, spell availability
    checks, and NPC interaction logic where level-based restrictions or bonuses are
    applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the player's current level, typically ranging
    from 1 to 80 depending on server configuration. Returns 0 if the player object
    is invalid or uninitialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Level Retrieval
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is valid

      int32 currentLevel = player->GetLevel();

      TC_LOG_INFO("player", "Player level: %d", currentLevel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Level-Based Conditional Logic
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nif (player->GetLevel() >= 70)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ is eligible for raid content\n    player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_RAID_KEY, 1);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Player needs to level up first\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You must reach level 70 to access this content.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal player data structures and should be used carefully
    in performance-critical sections. The returned value is cached internally by the
    Player class, so multiple calls within a short time frame will not cause additional
    database lookups. This method is thread-safe when called on valid player objects.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null or invalid Player object may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate the player pointer before calling GetLevel().
    The method does not perform any automatic validation of the returned level value
    against server configuration limits.
