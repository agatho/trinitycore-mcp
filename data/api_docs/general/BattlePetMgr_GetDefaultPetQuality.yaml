  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: GetDefaultPetQuality
  signature: BattlePetBreedQuality BattlePetMgr::GetDefaultPetQuality(int species)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the default quality level for a specified battle pet species.
  description: The GetDefaultPetQuality method returns the default breed quality assigned
    to a specific battle pet species within the BattlePet system. This quality value
    determines the initial stat scaling and potential of a pet when it is first obtained
    or summoned without any explicit quality modification. The method uses the species
    ID as input to look up the appropriate default quality from internal game data
    tables. It is commonly used during pet creation, initialization, or when determining
    base pet characteristics before any breeding or training modifications are applied.
  parameters:
  - name: species
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the battle pet species for which to
      retrieve the default quality. This value corresponds to the BattlePetSpecies
      ID used internally by TrinityCore's BattlePet system.
  returns: Returns a BattlePetBreedQuality enum value representing the default quality
    level for the specified pet species. Possible values typically include BATTLEPET_BREED_QUALITY_POOR,
    BATTLEPET_BREED_QUALITY_NORMAL, BATTLEPET_BREED_QUALITY_GOOD, BATTLEPET_BREED_QUALITY_FINE,
    BATTLEPET_BREED_QUALITY_EPIC, and BATTLEPET_BREED_QUALITY_LEGENDARY, though exact
    values depend on the game's internal configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve default quality for a specific pet species
    code: "BattlePetBreedQuality quality = battlePetMgr->GetDefaultPetQuality(12345);\n\
      if (quality == BATTLEPET_BREED_QUALITY_EPIC)\n{\n    // Handle epic quality\
      \ pets\n    printf(\"This pet has epic default quality\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely accesses internal BattlePet data structures or lookup tables
    that define default qualities per species. It may be called during pet creation,
    loading from database, or when initializing new pet instances in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided species ID is valid and corresponds to an existing
    battle pet species; invalid IDs might result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    quality values.
