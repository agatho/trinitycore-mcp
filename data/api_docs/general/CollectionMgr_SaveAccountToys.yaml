  class: CollectionMgr
  method: SaveAccountToys
  signature: void CollectionMgr::SaveAccountToys(int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the account's toy collection data to the database using the provided
    transaction.
  description: The SaveAccountToys method persists the current state of a player's
    toy collection to the database. It utilizes a database transaction object to ensure
    atomicity of the save operation, which is crucial for maintaining data consistency.
    This method is typically invoked when changes to the toy collection are made and
    need to be committed to the persistent storage. The transaction parameter allows
    for batching multiple database operations together, improving performance and
    ensuring that either all related changes are saved or none are, in case of failure.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: An integer representing the database transaction identifier used
      for saving the toy collection data. This value should correspond to an active
      transaction object previously initialized by the database layer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage with Transaction
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetCollectionMgr();

      Transaction trans;

      // ... perform operations on toy collection ...

      collectionMgr->SaveAccountToys(trans);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the transaction object passed in is valid and properly
    initialized. It does not handle transaction commit or rollback itself; those must
    be managed by the caller. The method may block during database I/O operations,
    so it should be used carefully in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized transaction ID can lead to undefined
    behavior or database corruption. Ensure that the transaction is properly started
    before calling this method and committed afterward.
