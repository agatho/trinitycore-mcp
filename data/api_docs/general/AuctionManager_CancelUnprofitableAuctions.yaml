  class: AuctionManager
  method: CancelUnprofitableAuctions
  signature: void AuctionManager::CancelUnprofitableAuctions(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Cancels auctions that are not profitable for the specified player bot.
  description: The CancelUnprofitableAuctions method iterates through all active auctions
    listed by the given player bot and removes those that do not meet profitability
    thresholds. This function is typically used in automated auction house management
    systems to optimize the bot's auction strategy by eliminating unprofitable listings.
    The method evaluates each auction based on current market conditions, item value,
    and associated auction house fees to determine if cancellation is warranted. It
    ensures that only profitable auctions remain active, thereby improving the bot's
    overall economic performance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose auctions
      will be evaluated and potentially canceled. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player object

      AuctionManager::CancelUnprofitableAuctions(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player object has active auctions in
    the auction house system. It performs no direct database operations but relies
    on internal auction data structures and market evaluation logic. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific version of TrinityCore being used.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and represents
    an actual bot with active auctions; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This
    function should not be called during critical auction house operations as it modifies
    auction listings directly.
