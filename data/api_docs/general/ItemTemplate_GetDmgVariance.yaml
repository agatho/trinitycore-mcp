  signature: float ItemTemplate::GetDmgVariance() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the damage variance factor for the item's weapon damage.
  description: The GetDmgVariance method retrieves the damage variance value associated
    with an ItemTemplate, which is used in combat calculations to determine the range
    of possible damage output for weapons. This value represents how much the actual
    damage can vary from the base damage value, typically expressed as a decimal multiplier.
    For example, a variance of 0.2 means that the final damage can be 20% higher or
    lower than the base damage. This method is commonly used in weapon damage calculations
    within the TrinityCore framework to ensure realistic and balanced combat mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the damage variance factor for the item. This
    value is typically between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no variance (fixed
    damage) and higher values indicate greater variation in damage output.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      float variance = itemTemplate->GetDmgVariance();

      printf("Damage Variance: %.2f\n", variance);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Damage Calculation
    code: 'ItemTemplate* weapon = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(54321);

      float baseDamage = 100.0f;

      float variance = weapon->GetDmgVariance();

      float minDamage = baseDamage * (1.0f - variance);

      float maxDamage = baseDamage * (1.0f + variance);

      printf("Min Damage: %.2f, Max Damage: %.2f\n", minDamage, maxDamage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ItemTemplate class and provides access to weapon
    damage variance data stored in the item template database. The variance value
    directly influences combat calculations and should be used consistently across
    all damage computation systems for accurate gameplay behavior.
