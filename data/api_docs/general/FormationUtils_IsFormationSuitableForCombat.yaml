  method: IsFormationSuitableForCombat
  signature: bool FormationUtils::IsFormationSuitableForCombat(FormationType formation)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified formation type is suitable for combat engagement.
  description: The IsFormationSuitableForCombat method evaluates a given formation
    type to determine if it is appropriate for use in combat situations. This utility
    function checks various formation properties and constraints to ensure that the
    selected formation supports effective combat behavior, such as proper positioning,
    mobility, and tactical alignment. The method considers factors like formation
    size, shape, and intended combat role when making this determination. It is typically
    used by AI systems or game logic to validate formation choices before initiating
    combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified formation type is suitable for combat engagement;
    otherwise, returns false. A return value of false indicates that the formation
    may not provide optimal tactical positioning or could interfere with combat effectiveness.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (FormationUtils::IsFormationSuitableForCombat(FormationType::Circle))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with combat using circle formation\n    StartCombatWithFormation(FormationType::Circle);\n\
      } else {\n    // Fall back to default formation\n    StartCombatWithFormation(FormationType::Line);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Formation Validation
    code: "void ValidateAndExecuteCombat(FormationType selectedFormation) {\n    if\
      \ (FormationUtils::IsFormationSuitableForCombat(selectedFormation)) {\n    \
      \    ExecuteCombatAction(selectedFormation);\n    } else {\n        // Log warning\
      \ and use fallback\n        LOG_WARN(\"combat\", \"Selected formation %u not\
      \ suitable for combat\", static_cast<uint32>(selectedFormation));\n        ExecuteCombatAction(FormationType::Default);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against predefined combat suitability
    criteria. It may be used in conjunction with other formation validation utilities
    to ensure tactical coherence during combat operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the FormationType parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid values might lead to unexpected behavior or undefined results. The
    method should not be called during critical combat phases without proper validation
    to avoid tactical inconsistencies.
