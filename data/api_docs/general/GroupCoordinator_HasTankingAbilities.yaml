  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: HasTankingAbilities
  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::HasTankingAbilities() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group coordinator has any tanking abilities available.
  description: The HasTankingAbilities method checks if the GroupCoordinator instance
    possesses any abilities that are classified as tanking abilities. This typically
    involves evaluating the current state of the group's members and their respective
    abilities to determine if there is a suitable candidate for tanking duties. The
    method is commonly used in group management systems within World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to ensure proper role assignment and combat readiness. It
    does not modify any internal state but rather performs a read-only check on the
    coordinator's ability set.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one tanking ability is present among the group
    coordinator's abilities; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (groupCoordinator.HasTankingAbilities()) {\n    // Proceed with tanking-related\
      \ logic\n    std::cout << \"Group has a tanking ability available\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where no tanking abilities are present\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"No tanking abilities available in group\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that tanking abilities are properly categorized within
    the GroupCoordinator's internal ability tracking system. Performance is generally
    fast as it only involves checking precomputed flags or lists, but could be impacted
    if the underlying data structure requires expensive lookups.
