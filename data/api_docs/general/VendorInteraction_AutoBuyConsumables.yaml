  class: VendorInteraction
  method: AutoBuyConsumables
  signature: void VendorInteraction::AutoBuyConsumables(Player * player, uint32 vendorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically purchases consumable items from a vendor for the specified
    player.
  description: The AutoBuyConsumables method enables a player to automatically purchase
    all available consumable items from a specified vendor. This functionality is
    typically used in automated botting or AI systems where players want to streamline
    their shopping process without manual interaction. The method iterates through
    the vendor's inventory and buys consumable items up to the player's maximum carry
    capacity, ensuring that the player does not exceed their item limits. It handles
    currency deduction and item delivery automatically, making it a convenient utility
    for automated gameplay scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom consumables will be purchased.
      Must be a valid player instance with an active connection to the game world.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor from which items are to
      be purchased. This value must correspond to a valid vendor NPC in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player instance

      uint32 vendorGuid = 12345; // GUID of the vendor

      VendorInteraction::AutoBuyConsumables(player, vendorGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 vendorGuid = 12345;\nif (player && player->IsInWorld())\
      \ {\n    VendorInteraction::AutoBuyConsumables(player, vendorGuid);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle invalid player state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has sufficient currency to purchase all
    consumable items. It does not check for specific item restrictions or quest requirements
    that might prevent purchasing certain items. The implementation may be affected
    by server-side limits on how many items can be purchased in a single transaction.
  warnings: Using this method in automated scripts may violate game rules or terms
    of service depending on the context. It should only be used in legitimate development
    or testing environments where such automation is allowed.
