  class: TradeSystem
  method: DetermineVendorType
  signature: VendorType TradeSystem::DetermineVendorType(const Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the vendor type of a creature for trade system interactions.
  description: The DetermineVendorType method analyzes the provided Creature object
    to identify its role within the game's vendor system. This function examines various
    properties and flags associated with the creature, such as its NPC flags, vendor
    data, and interaction capabilities, to classify it into one of several predefined
    vendor types. The result is crucial for determining how the trade system should
    behave when a player interacts with the creature, including which items can be
    sold, what prices apply, and whether special vendor behaviors are enabled. This
    method typically serves as part of the broader trade system logic and is invoked
    during player-vendor interactions to ensure proper handling of transactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a VendorType enum value indicating the specific category or classification
    of the creature as a vendor. Possible values may include VENDOR_TYPE_NORMAL, VENDOR_TYPE_EQUIPMENT,
    VENDOR_TYPE_FOOD, VENDOR_TYPE_REAGENT, etc., depending on how the game defines
    these types internally.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Trade Interaction
    code: "void HandleVendorInteraction(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n \
      \   VendorType type = sTradeSystem->DetermineVendorType(creature);\n    switch\
      \ (type)\n    {\n        case VENDOR_TYPE_NORMAL:\n            // Standard vendor\
      \ behavior\n            break;\n        case VENDOR_TYPE_EQUIPMENT:\n      \
      \      // Equipment-specific handling\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Default or unknown type\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal creature data structures and may be affected
    by custom modifications to NPC flags or vendor configurations. It is recommended
    to call this function only when the Creature object is valid and fully initialized,
    as invalid pointers could lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed into this method is not null before
    calling it, otherwise the behavior is undefined. Also, be aware that vendor types
    may vary based on game expansion or custom server modifications.
