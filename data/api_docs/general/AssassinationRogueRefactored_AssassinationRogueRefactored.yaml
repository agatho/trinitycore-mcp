  class: AssassinationRogueRefactored
  method: AssassinationRogueRefactored
  signature: void AssassinationRogueRefactored::AssassinationRogueRefactored(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the Assassination Rogue AI behavior for a player bot
  description: This method serves as the constructor-like initializer for the AssassinationRogueRefactored
    class, setting up the AI behavior and state for an assassination-focused rogue
    player bot. It configures the bot's combat strategy, ability usage patterns, and
    targeting preferences specific to the assassination rogue specialization. The
    method ensures that all necessary AI components are properly initialized before
    the bot enters combat or begins performing actions. This initialization includes
    setting up spell priorities, cooldown management, and tactical decision-making
    logic tailored for assassination gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'AssassinationRogueRefactored rogueAI(bot);

      rogueAI.AssassinationRogueRefactored(bot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during bot initialization. The Player*
    parameter is expected to be a valid pointer to an initialized player object with
    proper rogue specialization. This method does not perform any combat actions directly
    but prepares the AI state for subsequent combat operations.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same bot instance may lead to
    undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the Player* parameter is valid
    and not null before calling this method.
