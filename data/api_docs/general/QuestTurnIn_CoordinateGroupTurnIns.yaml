documentation:
  brief: Coordinates quest turn-ins for all members of a group
  description: The CoordinateGroupTurnIns method processes and handles quest completion
    for all players within a specified group. It ensures that each group member's
    quest progress is properly updated and validated according to the game's quest
    system mechanics. This method typically iterates through all group members, checks
    their individual quest requirements, and applies necessary updates or rewards.
    The function is commonly used in scenarios where group-based quest completion
    is required, such as when a group successfully completes a dungeon or achieves
    a collective objective that grants quests to all participants.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Quest Turn-In
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    questTurnIn->CoordinateGroupTurnIns(playerGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all group members are within the same zone and have
    access to the relevant quests. It may internally perform checks for quest validity,
    player state, and group membership. The implementation likely handles synchronization
    of quest data across multiple players in a group context.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper group validation may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and contains at least
    one member before invoking this function.
