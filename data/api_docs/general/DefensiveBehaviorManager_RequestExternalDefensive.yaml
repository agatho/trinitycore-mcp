  class: DefensiveBehaviorManager
  method: RequestExternalDefensive
  signature: void DefensiveBehaviorManager::RequestExternalDefensive(int target, DefensivePriority
    priority)
documentation:
  brief: Requests an external defensive behavior for a specified target with given
    priority.
  description: The RequestExternalDefensive method is used to initiate or request
    a defensive action from an external source, such as another NPC or system component,
    targeting a specific entity. This method allows the calling object to signal its
    need for protection or assistance against a threat. The priority parameter determines
    how urgently this defensive request should be handled by the receiving system.
    This functionality is typically used in AI-driven combat scenarios where NPCs
    may require support from other entities or systems to maintain their defensive
    stance.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The identifier of the target entity that requires defensive assistance.
      This value usually represents a GUID or index of the unit being protected.
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level of the defensive request, indicating how urgently
      the defense should be executed. Higher values typically result in faster response
      times from external systems.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DefensiveBehaviorManager* manager = ...;

      manager->RequestExternalDefensive(12345, DefensivePriority::HIGH);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Targeting
    code: "Unit* targetUnit = GetTarget();\nif (targetUnit)\n{\n    DefensiveBehaviorManager*\
      \ manager = GetDefensiveManager();\n    manager->RequestExternalDefensive(targetUnit->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),\
      \ DefensivePriority::MEDIUM);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI behavior management system and should be called
    only when a defensive action is required. It does not directly perform any defensive
    actions but rather communicates the need for external assistance. The actual defensive
    behavior implementation depends on how the receiving system interprets the priority
    and target parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter refers to a valid unit or entity, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur. Also, excessive use of high-priority requests can
    overwhelm the system's ability to respond effectively.
