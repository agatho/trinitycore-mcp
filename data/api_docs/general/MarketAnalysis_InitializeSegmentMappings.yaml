  brief: Initializes internal segment mappings for market analysis data structures
  description: The InitializeSegmentMappings method sets up and configures the internal
    data structures used for tracking and analyzing market segments within the TrinityCore
    auction house system. This method is responsible for establishing the mapping
    between different item categories, quality levels, and price ranges that are used
    for market trend analysis. It typically runs during server initialization or when
    market data needs to be refreshed. The method ensures that all segment boundaries
    are properly defined and that the internal lookup tables are populated with valid
    data for subsequent market analysis operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      analysis.InitializeSegmentMappings();

      // Market segment mappings are now ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. Repeated
    calls may result in undefined behavior or data corruption. The method performs
    no locking internally, so it should be called from a single-threaded context during
    startup.
  warnings: Calling this method after market analysis has already begun may cause
    inconsistencies in reported market trends. Ensure all market data consumers are
    paused or stopped before calling this method.
