documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Vehicle object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The Vehicle destructor is called when a Vehicle object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of vehicle-related data
    structures, including releasing references to passengers, removing the vehicle
    from the game world, and freeing any dynamically allocated memory. This method
    is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime during object destruction and should
    not be called directly unless performing explicit cleanup. The destructor handles
    necessary game state cleanup to prevent memory leaks and maintain world consistency.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction of Vehicle Object
    code: 'Vehicle* vehicle = new Vehicle();

      // ... use the vehicle ...

      delete vehicle; // Destructor called here automatically'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-Allocated Vehicle Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    Vehicle vehicle;\n    // ... use vehicle ...\n\
      } // Destructor called automatically when function exits"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Vehicle destructor is part of the standard C++ object lifecycle and is
    typically not overridden in derived classes. It's important to ensure that all
    passengers are properly removed from the vehicle before destruction to avoid dangling
    references. The destructor may also trigger cleanup of related GameObject or Unit
    references within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke the Vehicle destructor unless you have a specific
    reason and understand the implications. Manual invocation can lead to double-destruction
    issues if the object is still managed by the game's memory management system.
    Always let the C++ runtime handle destruction through proper scope management
    or explicit delete operations.
