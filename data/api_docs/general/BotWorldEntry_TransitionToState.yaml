  class: BotWorldEntry
  method: TransitionToState
  signature: bool BotWorldEntry::TransitionToState(BotWorldEntryState newState)
documentation:
  brief: Transitions the bot world entry to a new state and returns true if successful.
  description: The TransitionToState method is responsible for changing the current
    state of a BotWorldEntry instance to the specified new state. This method typically
    manages state transitions within the context of a bot's lifecycle or behavior
    in the game world. It ensures that the transition adheres to valid state change
    rules and performs necessary setup or cleanup operations associated with the new
    state. The method may be used during bot initialization, state changes triggered
    by events, or when transitioning between different operational modes such as idle,
    active, or inactive states.
  parameters:
  - name: newState
    description: The target BotWorldEntryState to transition to. This parameter defines
      the desired new state for the bot world entry. Valid values depend on the enumeration
      definition of BotWorldEntryState, which typically includes states like IDLE,
      ACTIVE, INACTIVE, MOVING, or other behavior-specific states.
  returns: Returns true if the state transition was successful and the bot world entry
    has been updated to the new state. Returns false if the transition failed due
    to invalid state changes, internal errors, or if the requested state is already
    the current state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Transition
    code: "BotWorldEntry* entry = GetBotWorldEntry();\nif (entry->TransitionToState(BotWorldEntryState::ACTIVE))\
      \ {\n    // Successfully transitioned to active state\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\"\
      , \"Bot transitioned to active state.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to transition\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to transition bot to active state.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: State Transition with Error Handling
    code: "BotWorldEntry* entry = GetBotWorldEntry();\nBotWorldEntryState targetState\
      \ = BotWorldEntryState::INACTIVE;\n\nif (entry->TransitionToState(targetState))\
      \ {\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Bot successfully transitioned to inactive state.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Handle failed transition\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed\
      \ to transition bot to inactive state. Current state: {}\", entry->GetCurrentState());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation checks before allowing a
    state change, such as ensuring that the new state is compatible with the current
    state or that required resources are available. It may also trigger callbacks
    or notifications to other systems when a successful transition occurs.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the BotWorldEntry
    instance can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all necessary setup has been
    completed before attempting to change states.
