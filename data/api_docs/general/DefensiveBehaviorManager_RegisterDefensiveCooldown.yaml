    & cooldown)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a defensive cooldown with the DefensiveBehaviorManager for tracking
    and management.
  description: The RegisterDefensiveCooldown method is used to add a defensive cooldown
    to the DefensiveBehaviorManager's internal tracking system. This allows the system
    to monitor and manage cooldowns that are applied to player or NPC defensive behaviors.
    The method takes a DefensiveCooldown object as input, which contains information
    about the cooldown such as its duration, associated spell or ability, and any
    relevant flags or conditions. Once registered, the cooldown can be queried, updated,
    or removed by other methods within the manager. This is essential for maintaining
    accurate cooldown state during combat and behavior execution in World of Warcraft's
    AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: cooldown
    description: A const reference to a DefensiveCooldown object that contains all
      necessary information about the defensive cooldown to be registered, including
      duration, spell ID, and behavior flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Registration of a Defensive Cooldown
    code: 'DefensiveCooldown cooldown;

      cooldown.SpellId = 12345;

      cooldown.Duration = 3000; // 3 seconds

      cooldown.BehaviorFlags = DEFENSIVE_BEHAVIOR_FLAG_IMMUNITY;

      manager.RegisterDefensiveCooldown(cooldown);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Cooldowns in a Loop
    code: "std::vector<DefensiveCooldown> cooldowns;\n// ... populate cooldowns vector\
      \ with various defensive cooldowns\nfor (const auto& cd : cooldowns)\n{\n  \
      \  manager.RegisterDefensiveCooldown(cd);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during behavior initialization or when a
    defensive ability is activated. The DefensiveBehaviorManager maintains an internal
    collection of registered cooldowns, and this registration process ensures that
    the cooldown state is properly tracked throughout the creature's lifecycle.
  warnings: Ensure that the DefensiveCooldown object passed to this method contains
    valid data, especially the SpellId and Duration fields, as invalid values may
    cause unexpected behavior or crashes in the AI system. Avoid registering duplicate
    cooldowns with the same spell ID without proper handling.
