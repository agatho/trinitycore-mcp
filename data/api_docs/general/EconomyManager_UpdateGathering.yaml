documentation:
  brief: Updates the gathering system state based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateGathering method is responsible for processing and updating
    the state of gathering activities within the EconomyManager. It typically handles
    resource collection timers, cooldowns, and progression tracking for players engaged
    in gathering professions such as mining, herbalism, or skinning. This method is
    called periodically by the game loop to ensure that gathering operations are properly
    managed and synchronized with real-time progression.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    economyManager.UpdateGathering(diff);\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game update loop and should
    be called with a time delta (diff) parameter representing milliseconds since last
    update. It's important that this method is not called too frequently to avoid
    performance overhead, as it may perform database writes or other expensive operations.
