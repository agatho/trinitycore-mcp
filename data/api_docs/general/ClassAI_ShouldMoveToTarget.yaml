  class: ClassAI
  method: ShouldMoveToTarget
  signature: bool ClassAI::ShouldMoveToTarget(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI-controlled creature should move toward its current
    target.
  description: The ShouldMoveToTarget method evaluates the AI state and conditions
    to decide if the creature should initiate or continue movement toward its assigned
    target. This method is typically used within the AI update loop to control movement
    behavior based on threat level, distance to target, and other combat-related factors.
    It returns true when movement to the target is deemed necessary or beneficial
    for the creature's AI strategy, and false otherwise. The method may modify the
    target parameter to reflect a new target if the current one is no longer valid
    or optimal.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer that represents the current target's identifier.
      This value may be updated by the method if a different target is deemed more
      appropriate.
  returns: Returns true if the AI-controlled creature should move toward its target,
    false otherwise. A return of true indicates that movement is either required or
    recommended for tactical reasons.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "if (creature->GetAI()->ShouldMoveToTarget(&targetId)) {\n    creature->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(creature->GetVictim());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking movement condition before pathfinding
    code: "int currentTarget = creature->GetVictim() ? creature->GetVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue()\
      \ : 0;\nif (creature->GetAI()->ShouldMoveToTarget(&currentTarget)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with movement logic\n    creature->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(creature->GetVictim());\n\
      } else {\n    // Do not move, perhaps perform other actions\n    creature->DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making process and should be
    called frequently during the AI update cycle. It may internally check for target
    validity, distance thresholds, and combat state to determine movement necessity.
  warnings: The target parameter might be modified by this method, so ensure that
    any references to the original value are updated accordingly. Improper handling
    of the target reference can lead to unexpected behavior or invalid targeting states.
