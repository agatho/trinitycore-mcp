  class: AuraScript
  method: _Validate
  signature: bool AuraScript::_Validate(const SpellInfo * entry)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the AuraScript instance is compatible with the provided
    spell entry.
  description: The _Validate method checks if the current AuraScript implementation
    is suitable for use with a given SpellInfo object. This method ensures that the
    aura script's requirements and constraints align with the spell's properties,
    such as aura type, duration, and other spell-specific attributes. It typically
    performs internal validation logic to confirm that the script can safely be applied
    to the specified spell without causing runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
    The validation occurs during aura application and helps maintain game integrity
    by preventing incompatible auras from being applied to spells.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure representing the spell that this
      aura script is intended to be used with. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the AuraScript is valid and compatible with the provided
    spell entry, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that
    the aura script cannot be properly applied to the specified spell due to incompatibility
    or invalid configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    bool _Validate(const\
      \ SpellInfo* entry) override\n    {\n        // Allow only specific aura types\n\
      \        if (entry->GetAuraType() == SPELL_AURA_MOD_STAT)\n            return\
      \ true;\n        \n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced validation with multiple conditions
    code: "class AdvancedAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    bool _Validate(const\
      \ SpellInfo* entry) override\n    {\n        // Validate aura type and spell\
      \ category\n        if (entry->GetAuraType() != SPELL_AURA_DUMMY)\n        \
      \    return false;\n        \n        // Ensure the spell is not flagged as\
      \ passive\n        if (entry->HasAttribute(SPELL_ATTR0_PASSIVE))\n         \
      \   return false;\n        \n        // Validate that it's a harmful spell\n\
      \        if (entry->GetSpellFamilyName() == SPELLFAMILY_MAGE && entry->GetSpellIconID()\
      \ != 1234)\n            return false;\n        \n        return true;\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the aura application process and should be implemented
    efficiently to avoid performance bottlenecks. The validation logic should not
    have side effects or modify spell data. It's recommended to cache any expensive
    computations if the same spell entry is validated multiple times.
  warnings: Do not perform operations that could alter the spell state or cause side
    effects within this method. Avoid calling methods that might trigger additional
    aura processing or modify global game state, as this can lead to undefined behavior
    or infinite recursion.
