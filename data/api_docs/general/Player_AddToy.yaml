  brief: Adds a toy to the player's collection, enabling the player to use the toy
    in-game.
  description: 'The AddToy method allows a player to add a specific toy item to their
    collection. This method is typically used during gameplay to unlock or acquire
    toys that can be used for various in-game purposes such as cosmetic displays or
    quest completion. The method takes two parameters: the first parameter is the
    unique identifier (itemId) of the toy being added, and the second parameter is
    flags that define how the toy should be handled. The toy will be added to the
    player''s collection and may be available for use depending on the flags specified.'
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the toy item being added. This value corresponds
      to the item ID in the game database, typically used for toys that are part of
      the game's collection.
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask that defines how the toy should be handled. The flags determine
      whether the toy is added as a permanent or temporary item, and can affect its
      availability in-game.
  returns: null

    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->AddToy(12345, 0);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with flags

    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the player's collection management system and should
    be used carefully when dealing with game mechanics involving toys. The flags parameter
    affects how the toy is handled, and may influence its availability for use or
    display.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect toy acquisition or game
    behavior. Care should be taken when specifying the flags parameter to ensure correct
    handling of the toy.
