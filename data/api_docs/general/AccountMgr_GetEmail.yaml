  class: AccountMgr
  method: GetEmail
  signature: bool AccountMgr::GetEmail(uint32 accountId, std::string & email)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the email address associated with a given account ID.
  description: The GetEmail method fetches the email address linked to a specific
    account identifier from the database. It is commonly used in account management
    operations, such as verifying user credentials or sending account-related notifications.
    The method performs a database lookup using the provided account ID and stores
    the resulting email in the output parameter. If the account does not exist or
    no email is associated with it, the method returns false and leaves the email
    string unchanged. This function is typically part of the TrinityCore's account
    management system and requires proper database connectivity to operate correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account for which to retrieve the email
      address. Must be a valid, existing account ID in the database.
  - name: email
    description: Reference to a string where the retrieved email address will be stored
      upon successful execution. If the method fails, this parameter remains unmodified.
  returns: Returns true if the email address was successfully retrieved for the given
    account ID; otherwise returns false if the account does not exist or no email
    is associated with it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nstd::string email;\nif (AccountMgr::GetEmail(accountId,\
      \ email)) {\n    printf(\"Account %u has email: %s\\n\", accountId, email.c_str());\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Failed to retrieve email for account %u\\n\", accountId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query and should be used judiciously in performance-critical
    sections of code. It is recommended to cache frequently accessed email addresses
    to reduce database load.
  warnings: Ensure that the accountId parameter is valid before calling this function,
    as invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or database errors. Also, be aware
    that this method does not validate the format of the retrieved email address.
