  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateDeathKnightAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a Death Knight AI for the specified bot player
  description: The CreateDeathKnightAI method is responsible for generating a specialized
    Artificial Intelligence instance tailored for Death Knight class bots within the
    TrinityCore framework. This function likely sets up the bot's behavior patterns,
    ability usage, targeting logic, and combat strategies specific to the Death Knight
    class. The method operates on a player object that represents the bot character,
    configuring its AI subsystem to handle Death Knight-specific mechanics such as
    rune management, ghoul control, and class-specific abilities. It typically returns
    an identifier or status code indicating success or failure of the AI creation
    process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the result of the AI creation operation.
    A positive value usually indicates successful creation, while negative values
    may represent errors or failures during initialization. The exact meaning of return
    codes should be verified against the internal implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Bot player object\nint result = factory->CreateDeathKnightAI(bot);\n\
      if (result >= 0) {\n    // AI successfully created for Death Knight bot\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI system which extends standard TrinityCore
    bot functionality. The implementation likely involves setting up class-specific
    behavior trees, ability priorities, and resource management strategies unique
    to Death Knights. Developers should ensure that the Player object passed is properly
    initialized as a bot before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player or without proper initialization
    may lead to undefined behavior. The return value must be checked to confirm successful
    AI creation before attempting to use the bot in combat scenarios.
