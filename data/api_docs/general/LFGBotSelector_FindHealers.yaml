  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: FindHealers
  signature: int LFGBotSelector::FindHealers(uint8 minLevel, uint8 maxLevel, uint32
    count)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the number of available healers within specified level
    range for LFG purposes.
  description: The FindHealers method searches through the player base to identify
    eligible healers based on minimum and maximum level constraints. It is typically
    used by the LFG (Looking For Group) system to locate suitable players who can
    fulfill healing roles in dungeons or raids. The method filters players according
    to their class, level range, and availability status. It returns a count of how
    many healers meet these criteria, which can then be used for group formation or
    queue management.
  parameters:
  - name: minLevel
    description: The minimum character level required for a healer to be considered.
      Valid values are between 1 and 80.
  - name: maxLevel
    description: The maximum character level allowed for a healer. Must be greater
      than or equal to minLevel and less than or equal to 80.
  - name: count
    description: The desired number of healers to find. This parameter is used as
      an input to determine how many players should match the criteria.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the actual number of healers found that
    meet the specified level range and other criteria. A return value of 0 indicates
    no suitable healers were found.
  examples:
  - title: Find healers between levels 10 and 60
    code: int healerCount = selector.FindHealers(10, 60, 3);
    language: cpp
  - title: Find all available healers at max level
    code: int healerCount = selector.FindHealers(80, 80, 5);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player data structures and LFG
    queues. It may perform filtering based on player availability flags or role preferences.
    The implementation might cache results for performance reasons in high-traffic
    scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that minLevel is not greater than maxLevel, as this could lead
    to unexpected behavior or invalid results. Also, be aware that the method's effectiveness
    depends on accurate player data and LFG system state.
