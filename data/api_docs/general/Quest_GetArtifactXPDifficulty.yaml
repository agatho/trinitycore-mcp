  class: Quest
  method: GetArtifactXPDifficulty
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetArtifactXPDifficulty() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the artifact experience points difficulty level for the quest.
  description: This method retrieves the artifact experience points difficulty value
    associated with a specific quest. The returned value represents the difficulty
    level used to calculate artifact experience points rewards when completing the
    quest. This is typically used in conjunction with artifact-related mechanics and
    quest completion handling within the TrinityCore framework. The method is part
    of the Quest class and operates on const data, ensuring thread safety during execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the artifact XP difficulty level. This
    value corresponds to the difficulty tier used for calculating artifact experience
    points rewards when completing the quest, with higher values indicating more challenging
    or rewarding quests.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 difficulty = quest->GetArtifactXPDifficulty();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and operates on const data, making
    it suitable for use in multi-threaded environments. The value returned may vary
    based on the quest's artifact-related configuration and can be used to determine
    reward scaling.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for determining quest completion
    status; instead, it should be used in conjunction with other artifact-related
    methods for proper reward calculation.
