api:
  class: HealerPositioning
  method: CalculateHealingCoverage
  signature: float HealerPositioning::CalculateHealingCoverage(const int & healerPos,
    const int & allies)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the percentage of allies covered by a healer's healing radius
    based on positional alignment.
  description: The CalculateHealingCoverage method determines how effectively a healer
    can provide support to nearby allies within their healing range. It evaluates
    the spatial relationship between the healer's position and the positions of allied
    units, returning a coverage value between 0.0 and 1.0. A value of 1.0 indicates
    full coverage, while 0.0 means no allies are within the healer's effective range.
    This method is crucial for AI decision-making in group-based encounters where
    optimal positioning significantly impacts healing efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: healerPos
    description: The absolute position coordinate of the healer in the game world.
      This represents the healer's location on the X/Y/Z axis.
  - name: allies
    description: A bitmask or integer representing the positions and statuses of allied
      units. Each bit or value corresponds to a specific ally's presence or position
      within the healer's potential coverage area.
  returns: Returns a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the percentage of
    allies covered by the healer's healing radius. A value of 1.0 means all targeted
    allies are within effective range, while 0.0 indicates no allies are covered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for determining healing efficiency
    code: "float coverage = healerPositioning.CalculateHealingCoverage(healerPosition,\
      \ allyPositions);\nif (coverage > 0.8f) {\n    // Proceed with aggressive healing\
      \ strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using coverage to optimize healer positioning in a group
    code: "int currentHealerPos = GetHealerPosition();\nint allyPositions = GetAlliesInRadius(currentHealerPos,\
      \ 30);\nfloat coverage = healerPositioning.CalculateHealingCoverage(currentHealerPos,\
      \ allyPositions);\nif (coverage < 0.5f) {\n    // Move healer to a better position\n\
      \    MoveToOptimalHealingSpot();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the healer's range and the allies' positions are
    already normalized within the game world coordinate system. The calculation may
    involve distance-based weighting or spatial partitioning for performance optimization
    in large groups.
  warnings: The method does not validate input parameters, so invalid positions or
    malformed ally data could result in undefined behavior. Ensure that healerPos
    represents a valid location and allies contains properly encoded position information
    before calling this method.
