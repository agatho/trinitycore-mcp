documentation:
  brief: Updates the cleave mechanics awareness for the MechanicAwareness instance.
  description: The UpdateCleaveMechanics method is responsible for recalculating and
    refreshing the awareness of cleave-related game mechanics within the MechanicAwareness
    system. This typically involves checking the current state of targets, evaluating
    proximity conditions, and updating internal tracking structures to ensure accurate
    detection and response to cleave effects such as those from abilities like Cleave,
    Whirlwind, or similar area-of-effect attacks. The method is generally invoked
    during game loop updates or when specific combat events occur that may affect
    cleave mechanics awareness.

  - title: Basic usage in combat update
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    mechanicAwareness.UpdateCleaveMechanics();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal target tracking and proximity
    detection systems. It may be called frequently during combat updates, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account when implementing custom logic.
