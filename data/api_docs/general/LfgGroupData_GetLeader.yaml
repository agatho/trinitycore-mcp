  class: LfgGroupData
  method: GetLeader
  signature: int LfgGroupData::GetLeader() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the leader player for this LFG group.
  description: The GetLeader method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    player who is currently designated as the leader of the Looking For Group (LFG)
    group. This method is used internally by the TrinityCore server to manage group
    leadership and permissions within the LFG system. The returned value represents
    the GUID of the leader player, which can be used to identify or reference the
    specific player in other operations. This method does not perform any validation
    on whether the leader is still online or valid; it simply returns the stored GUID
    value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the group leader. If no leader has
    been set, this may return 0 or an invalid GUID value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve group leader GUID
    code: "LfgGroupData* groupData = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nint leaderGuid\
      \ = groupData->GetLeader();\nif (leaderGuid != 0)\n{\n    // Process the leader\
      \ GUID\n    printf(\"Group leader GUID: %d\\n\", leaderGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns a stored value. It's likely used
    in conjunction with other LFG group management functions to maintain group state
    and permissions. The returned GUID should be validated before use to ensure the
    player still exists in the game world.
