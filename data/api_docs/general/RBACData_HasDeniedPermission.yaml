documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific permission is denied for the RBAC data.
  description: The HasDeniedPermission method determines whether a given permission
    ID has been explicitly denied within the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) data
    structure. This method is used to enforce access restrictions by checking if a
    particular permission has been blocked, which can be crucial for security and
    gameplay mechanics in TrinityCore. The method performs a lookup in the internal
    denied permissions collection and returns true if the specified permission ID
    exists in that collection, otherwise false. It does not consider granted permissions
    or inherited permissions, only explicit denials.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified permission ID is present in the denied permissions
    list; otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates that access to
    the given permission has been explicitly restricted.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a permission is denied
    code: "RBACData rbacData;\n// Assume rbacData has been populated with permissions\n\
      bool isDenied = rbacData.HasDeniedPermission(12345);\nif (isDenied)\n{\n   \
      \ // Handle the case where permission 12345 is denied\n    printf(\"Permission\
      \ 12345 is denied\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only checks for explicitly denied permissions and does not account
    for granted or inherited permissions. The RBACData object must be properly initialized
    with denied permissions before calling this method. Performance is generally good
    as it uses optimized lookup mechanisms, but frequent calls should still be considered
    in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Ensure that the RBACData instance has been correctly populated with denied
    permissions before invoking this method. Calling this method on an uninitialized
    or improperly configured RBACData object may lead to unexpected results. This
    method does not validate the permission ID itself, so invalid IDs might return
    false even if they should be treated as denied.
