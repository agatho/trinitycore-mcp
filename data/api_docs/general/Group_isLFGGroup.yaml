documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group is a Looking For Group (LFG) instance.
  description: The isLFGGroup method checks if the current group was created through
    the Looking For Group system in World of Warcraft. This is commonly used to distinguish
    between regular player groups and those formed specifically for dungeon finding
    or other LFG activities. The method returns true if the group is an LFG group,
    and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for handling special behaviors
    or restrictions that apply only to LFG-created groups, such as specific loot distribution
    rules or quest tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group was created via the Looking For Group system;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a group is an LFG group
    code: "if (player->GetGroup()->isLFGGroup()) {\n    // Handle LFG-specific logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"This is an LFG group.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle regular\
      \ group logic\n    sLog->outString(\"This is a normal group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags set during group creation. It's important
    to note that the result may change if the group's LFG status is altered through
    gameplay actions, such as joining or leaving an LFG queue.
