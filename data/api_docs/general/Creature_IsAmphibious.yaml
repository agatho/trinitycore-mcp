  class: Creature
  method: IsAmphibious
  signature: bool Creature::IsAmphibious() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature can exist in both water and land environments.
  description: The IsAmphibious method checks if a creature is capable of living in
    both aquatic and terrestrial environments, which is essential for creatures that
    can move between different biomes. This method is particularly useful for determining
    if a creature has the ability to swim and walk simultaneously, or if it can transition
    between water and land without requiring specific conditions or transformations.
    The functionality is based on the creature's movement type and its ability to
    handle both aquatic and ground movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature can exist in both water and land environments,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the creature has amphibious capabilities
    or not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->IsAmphibious()) {\n    // Creature can move in both water\
      \ and land\n    // Perform amphibious behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during creature AI logic to determine if a
    creature can perform actions that require it to be able to move in both environments.
    It may also be used for determining whether a creature should be able to use certain
    spells or abilities that require amphibious movement.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    movement-related methods, as misinterpretation of the creature's movement type
    can lead to incorrect behavior in game mechanics.
