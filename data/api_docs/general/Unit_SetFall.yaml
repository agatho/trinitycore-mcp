  method: SetFall
  signature: bool Unit::SetFall(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables fall movement for the unit.
  description: The SetFall method controls whether a unit can fall or not, typically
    used in conjunction with movement mechanics to manage unit behavior during flight
    or ground movement. This method is essential for controlling unit movement states
    and can be used to prevent units from falling when they should remain in place.
    The method returns true if the operation was successful, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the fall state was successfully set, false otherwise. A
    return value of false may indicate that the unit is not in a state where fall
    can be enabled or disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nbool result = unit->SetFall(true);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Fall movement enabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to control unit behavior. It may be called during movement updates or
    when setting up special movement states.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can affect unit movement
    and potentially cause unexpected behavior if not used correctly. Improper use
    may lead to units being unable to move properly.
