  class: PerformanceTimer
  method: PerformanceTimer
  signature: void PerformanceTimer::PerformanceTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new performance timer instance for measuring execution time
    intervals.
  description: The PerformanceTimer constructor initializes a new performance timer
    object. This class is typically used to measure the duration of operations or
    code sections for performance monitoring and debugging purposes within the TrinityCore
    framework. The timer uses high-resolution timing mechanisms available on the platform
    to provide accurate measurements. It is commonly employed in various subsystems
    such as AI behavior evaluation, database query timing, and general performance
    profiling throughout the core game engine.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Initialization
    code: 'PerformanceTimer timer;

      // Timer is now ready to be used for measuring time intervals'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Timer for Performance Measurement
    code: 'PerformanceTimer timer;

      // ... some code to measure ...

      uint64_t elapsed = timer.GetElapsedTime();

      TC_LOG_INFO("performance", "Operation took {} milliseconds", elapsed);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The PerformanceTimer class internally uses platform-specific high-resolution
    timers (such as QueryPerformanceCounter on Windows or clock_gettime on Unix-like
    systems). It's designed to be lightweight and efficient for frequent use in performance-critical
    code paths. The timer object should typically be stack-allocated for optimal performance.
  warnings: Be aware that the timer measures wall-clock time, which may be affected
    by system load, CPU frequency scaling, or other external factors. For precise
    micro-benchmarking, consider using dedicated benchmarking libraries or tools rather
    than relying solely on this timer class.
