documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently channeling a spell.
  description: 'The IsChanneling method determines whether the player character is
    currently engaged in channeling a spell, such as Shadow Word: Death or Healing
    Stream Totem. This method is commonly used in combat AI and spell management systems
    to prevent certain actions while a channel is active. The check typically involves
    examining the player''s current casting state and verifying that a channeling
    spell is in progress. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper game
    mechanics and preventing invalid spell interactions during channeling periods.'
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently channeling a spell, false otherwise.
    The method performs a state check on the player's casting manager to determine
    if any channeling spell is active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Channeling Check
    code: "if (player->GetSpellHistory()->IsChanneling()) {\n    // Player cannot\
      \ perform other actions\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat AI Logic
    code: "void MarksmanshipAI::UpdateAI(Unit* target) {\n    if (m_castManager->IsChanneling())\
      \ {\n        // Avoid casting new spells while channeling\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n    // Proceed with normal spell casting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the player's spell casting
    system. It should be called frequently in update loops to ensure accurate real-time
    status checking. The implementation typically checks against a list or flag indicating
    active channeling spells rather than performing complex spell validation.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a substitute for proper spell cooldown management.
    Channeling state does not automatically prevent all actions - other systems may
    still need to be checked for complete action validation. Also, ensure that the
    player object is valid before calling this method to avoid potential crashes.
