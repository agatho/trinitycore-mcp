  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: PursueAchievement
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::PursueAchievement(uint32 achievementId)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the process of pursuing a specific achievement for the player.
  description: The PursueAchievement method triggers the advancement or completion
    of a specified achievement within the game's achievement system. This method is
    typically used by AI behavior scripts to dynamically assign or progress achievements
    based on player actions or events. It integrates with TrinityCore's achievement
    tracking mechanisms to update player progress and potentially reward players upon
    achieving milestones. The method does not directly validate the existence of the
    achievement ID, so it's expected that valid achievement IDs are passed to prevent
    undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: achievementId
    description: The unique identifier of the achievement to pursue. This value must
      correspond to a valid achievement defined in the game's database or else the
      method will have no effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Achievement Pursuit
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = ...;

      behaviorMgr->PursueAchievement(12345); // Attempt to pursue achievement with
      ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Achievement Pursuit Based on Player State
    code: "AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = ...;\nPlayer* player = ...;\nif\
      \ (player->GetLevel() >= 80)\n{\n    behaviorMgr->PursueAchievement(54321);\
      \ // Award high-level achievement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI behavior system and should be used carefully
    in scripted environments. It may not immediately reflect changes to the player's
    UI if called outside of a proper game tick context. Consider using it in conjunction
    with other methods like SendAchievementEarned() for immediate feedback.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent achievement ID will result in no visible
    effect and could potentially lead to silent failures. Always validate achievement
    IDs before calling this method if the source is dynamic or user-defined.
