documentation:
  brief: Updates the queue status for group coordination in TrinityCore.
  description: The UpdateQueueStatus method is responsible for managing and synchronizing
    the current state of group queues within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    ensures that all players in a group are properly accounted for in the queue system,
    updating their status based on various game events such as player joining or leaving
    a group, or changes in group composition. It plays a crucial role in maintaining
    accurate group queue information for dungeons, raids, and other group-based content.
    The method typically gets invoked automatically by the core system when group
    state changes occur, but can also be manually called to force an update.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Manual Queue Status Update
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator();

      coordinator->UpdateQueueStatus();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the group management system
    when group changes occur. Developers should not normally need to call this directly
    unless implementing custom group queue logic. The method may perform synchronization
    operations that could impact performance if called excessively in rapid succession.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can cause unnecessary overhead and
    potential synchronization issues. It's recommended to only invoke it when actual
    group state changes occur rather than on every game tick or event.
