documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AtonementTracker class for tracking atonement-related
    events and data.
  description: The AtonementTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    AtonementTracker class, setting up internal data structures and state required
    for tracking atonement-related events within the TrinityCore framework. This class
    is typically used to monitor player actions, spell effects, or other game mechanics
    that contribute to atonement tracking systems. The initialization process ensures
    all necessary variables are properly set to their default values, preparing the
    tracker for subsequent method calls and event handling. This constructor does
    not require any parameters and performs no complex operations beyond basic object
    setup.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AtonementTracker instance
    code: 'AtonementTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating an instance
    of the AtonementTracker class. Developers should be aware that the tracker may
    require additional setup or configuration through other methods before it can
    effectively track atonement events.
