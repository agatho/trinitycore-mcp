  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 ComboPointSystem::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of combo points a player can have in the ComboPointSystem.
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit of combo points that can
    be accumulated by a player character. In World of Warcraft's combat system, combo
    points are resources used by certain abilities and talents, typically associated
    with rogue classes. This method provides the maximum value that the combo point
    counter can reach before resetting. The returned value is constant for a given
    player class and spec, as it's determined by game mechanics and talent investments
    rather than dynamic factors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of combo points allowed
    in the system. This typically corresponds to the highest combo point count that
    can be achieved through normal gameplay progression, usually 5 for most rogue
    specializations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 maxComboPoints = player->GetComboPointSystem()->GetMax();\nif (maxComboPoints\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the maximum combo point value\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Maximum combo points: %u\", maxComboPoints);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combo Point Validation
    code: "ComboPointSystem* comboSystem = player->GetComboPointSystem();\nuint32\
      \ current = comboSystem->GetComboPoints();\nuint32 max = comboSystem->GetMax();\n\
      \nif (current > max)\n{\n    // This shouldn't happen in normal gameplay, but\
      \ for safety\n    comboSystem->SetComboPoints(max);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the game engine to validate combo
    point counts and enforce game rules. The maximum combo points value may vary between
    different player classes or specializations, though it's usually fixed at 5 for
    most rogue-based classes.
  warnings: While this method returns a constant value, developers should not assume
    that all players will have the same maximum combo points. Class-specific talents
    and abilities can modify this value in some cases, though such modifications are
    rare in standard TrinityCore implementations.
