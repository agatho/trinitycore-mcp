  method: GetChi
  signature: uint32 ResourceManager::GetChi()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current chi resource value of the player
  description: The GetChi method returns the amount of chi currently available to
    the player character. Chi is a resource used in certain classes like Monks and
    Warriors for special abilities and talents. This method provides access to the
    internal chi tracking mechanism within the ResourceManager class, allowing scripts
    and game systems to query the current chi level without modifying it directly.
    The returned value represents the exact chi count that can be used for abilities
    requiring chi consumption.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current chi resource amount. This value
    typically ranges from 0 to the maximum chi capacity (usually 100 for most classes).
    A return value of 0 indicates no chi is available, while higher values indicate
    increasing amounts of chi ready for use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Retrieval
    code: "uint32 currentChi = player->GetResource()->GetChi();\nif (currentChi >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Player has chi available\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_CHI_BOLT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Chi-based Ability Check
    code: "uint32 chi = player->GetResource()->GetChi();\nif (chi >= 25)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player can use an ability requiring 25 chi\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_ENERGY_BURST);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Insufficient chi, show message or\
      \ alternative behavior\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough chi to cast\
      \ this ability.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the chi resource; it only retrieves the current
    value. The ResourceManager class is typically accessed through a player's resource
    system, and the chi value may be updated by various game events such as spell
    casting, damage dealing, or passive effects. This method is thread-safe when called
    from within the game's main execution context.
  warnings: Be aware that chi values can change rapidly during combat due to abilities
    and passive effects. Always check the current chi level before attempting to consume
    resources to avoid invalid operations. Do not assume a fixed maximum chi value
    as it may vary based on class, talents, or buffs.
