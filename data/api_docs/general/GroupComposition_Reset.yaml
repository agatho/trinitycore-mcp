documentation:
  brief: Resets the group composition to its default state, clearing all members and
    resetting internal counters.
  description: The Reset method clears all current members from the GroupComposition
    object and resets any internal tracking variables to their initial values. This
    method is typically used when a group needs to be completely reinitialized, such
    as after a group disband or before forming a new composition. The operation effectively
    empties the group's member list and prepares the object for reuse with a fresh
    set of members. No parameters are required, and the method does not return any
    value.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'GroupComposition group;

      // ... add members to group ...

      group.Reset(); // Clears all members and resets internal state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in scenarios where active group operations
    are ongoing, as it will immediately clear the composition without notifying other
    systems. It is recommended to ensure no active group processing is occurring before
    calling Reset.
