  class: Trigger
  method: ~Trigger
  signature: void Trigger::~Trigger()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Trigger object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~Trigger destructor is automatically invoked when a Trigger object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of any dynamically allocated memory, registered callbacks, or game state references
    that the trigger may hold. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    triggers are often used to define interactive elements such as quest objectives,
    area triggers, or scripted events. The destructor guarantees that no dangling
    pointers or memory leaks occur when a trigger is removed from the game world.
    It also handles any necessary cleanup of internal data structures and ensures
    that the trigger does not leave behind any invalid references that could cause
    instability.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Destruction
    code: 'Trigger* trigger = new Trigger();

      // ... use the trigger ...

      delete trigger; // This calls ~Trigger()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Destruction via Scope
    code: "void CreateAndDestroyTrigger()\n{\n    Trigger localTrigger;\n    // ...\
      \ use localTrigger ...\n    // ~Trigger() called automatically when localTrigger\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that all references to the trigger
    are removed before it is destroyed to prevent use-after-free errors. The destructor
    may perform cleanup operations that could impact performance if called frequently
    in tight loops, though this is typically not an issue for trigger objects which
    are usually long-lived.
  warnings: Do not manually call the destructor; let C++ handle its invocation. Avoid
    storing pointers to triggers in containers or data structures that might outlive
    the trigger itself, as this can lead to dangling pointer issues when the destructor
    runs.
