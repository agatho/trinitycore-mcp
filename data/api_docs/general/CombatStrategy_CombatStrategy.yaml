  class: CombatStrategy
  method: CombatStrategy
  signature: void CombatStrategy::CombatStrategy(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a combat strategy with the specified name for use in AI-driven
    player or creature behavior.
  description: The CombatStrategy constructor initializes a new combat strategy instance
    with the provided name. This method sets up internal state and configuration that
    determines how an AI-controlled unit will behave during combat encounters. The
    name parameter is used to identify and categorize different combat strategies,
    allowing for dynamic selection of tactics based on encounter type, difficulty,
    or other game conditions. This constructor is typically called when setting up
    AI behavior trees or strategy patterns for NPCs or player characters in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for the combat strategy. This name is
      used to distinguish between different tactical approaches and is typically defined
      in configuration files or through scripting interfaces.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Strategy Initialization
    code: 'CombatStrategy strategy("AggressiveMelee");

      // Initializes a combat strategy named ''AggressiveMelee'' for use in AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Strategy Assignment
    code: 'std::string strategyName = "DefensiveRanged";

      CombatStrategy* strategy = new CombatStrategy(strategyName);

      // Creates a combat strategy dynamically based on game conditions or player
      settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely initializes internal data structures such as behavior
    trees, action queues, or tactic mappings. It may also register the strategy with
    a global strategy manager or AI system for retrieval during combat execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided name is unique and properly formatted to avoid
    conflicts with other strategies in the AI system. Improper naming could lead to
    incorrect strategy selection during combat scenarios.
