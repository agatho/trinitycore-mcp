  class: ArenaAI
  method: RegroupWithTeam
  signature: bool ArenaAI::RegroupWithTeam(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Repositions the AI-controlled player to a designated team formation location
    within an arena.
  description: The RegroupWithTeam method is responsible for repositioning an AI-controlled
    player to a specific location within an arena that corresponds to their team's
    formation. This method ensures that players maintain proper positioning during
    arena combat, particularly in battlegrounds like Alterac Valley or Eye of the
    Storm where strategic positioning is crucial. It typically handles movement logic
    and may involve pathfinding to reach designated team positions. The method returns
    true if the repositioning was successful and false otherwise, potentially indicating
    issues such as invalid target locations or movement failures.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier within
      the arena team. This parameter is used to determine which specific player in
      the team should be repositioned.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully repositioned to their designated
    team location, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the
    target position was invalid, movement failed, or the player is no longer in a
    valid arena state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Regroup Usage
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nbool success = arenaAI.RegroupWithTeam(&playerId);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Player successfully repositioned\n    printf(\"Player\
      \ repositioned successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to reposition player\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to reposition player\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during arena combat when players need to
    be moved back into formation after engaging enemies or when a new round begins.
    The implementation likely involves checking current player state, calculating
    movement paths, and executing the repositioning logic within the game's AI framework.
  warnings: Care should be taken when calling this method during active combat as
    it may interrupt ongoing actions or abilities. Additionally, passing an invalid
    player ID could lead to undefined behavior or failed positioning attempts.
