  class: GuildBankManager
  method: LogBankTransaction
  signature: void GuildBankManager::LogBankTransaction(uint32 playerGuid, BankOperation
    operation, uint32 itemId, uint32 tabId)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a guild bank transaction for a player, recording the operation type,
    item ID, and tab ID.
  description: The LogBankTransaction method records details of a guild bank transaction
    performed by a player. It logs information about the player's GUID, the type of
    bank operation (such as deposit or withdrawal), the item being transacted, and
    the specific tab within the guild bank where the action occurred. This method
    is typically used for maintaining audit trails, tracking guild resource management,
    and ensuring transparency in guild bank activities. The transaction data may be
    stored in a database or log system for later retrieval and analysis. This method
    does not perform any actual banking operations itself but serves as a logging
    mechanism to track what happened within the guild bank system.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player performing the bank transaction.
      Must be a valid player GUID from the game database.
  - name: operation
    description: The type of bank operation being performed. Should be an enum or
      integer value representing operations like deposit, withdrawal, or transfer.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item involved in the transaction. Must
      correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: tabId
    description: The identifier of the guild bank tab where the transaction occurred.
      Should reference an existing tab within the guild's bank structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildBankManager bankManager;

      uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      BankOperation operation = BANK_OP_DEPOSIT;

      uint32 itemId = 1001;

      uint32 tabId = 0;

      bankManager.LogBankTransaction(playerGuid, operation, itemId, tabId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Withdrawal Transaction
    code: 'GuildBankManager bankManager;

      uint32 playerGuid = 54321;

      BankOperation operation = BANK_OP_WITHDRAW;

      uint32 itemId = 2002;

      uint32 tabId = 2;

      bankManager.LogBankTransaction(playerGuid, operation, itemId, tabId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger guild bank system and may interact
    with database logging or event systems. It's important to ensure that all parameters
    are validated before calling this method to prevent invalid entries in the transaction
    logs. The method does not perform any checks on whether the player actually has
    permission to perform the operation, as that would be handled elsewhere in the
    system.
  warnings: Ensure that playerGuid and itemId values are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid GUIDs or item IDs could lead to data integrity issues in the
    logs. The operation parameter should be carefully validated against expected enum
    values to avoid unexpected behavior in the logging system.
