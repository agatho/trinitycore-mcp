documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotMemoryManager class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the BotMemoryManager
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the memory manager exists throughout
    the application lifecycle. This method provides global access to the bot memory
    management functionality, which is essential for coordinating memory allocation
    and deallocation across various bot-related subsystems in TrinityCore. The returned
    reference allows direct manipulation of the shared memory manager state without
    requiring explicit instantiation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single BotMemoryManager instance, enabling direct access
    to all public methods and properties of the memory manager
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the singleton instance
    code: 'BotMemoryManager& memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      // Use memoryManager to access bot memory functions

      memoryManager.AllocateMemory(1024);

      memoryManager.FreeMemory();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it returns a singleton instance that should
    be initialized once during application startup. The singleton pattern ensures
    consistent memory management across all bot instances and subsystems.
