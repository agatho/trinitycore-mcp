  signature: void CreatureAI::OnOwnerCombatInteraction(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles combat interactions when the creature's owner is engaged in combat
  description: The OnOwnerCombatInteraction method is invoked when a creature AI detects
    that its owner has entered combat. This method allows the AI to respond appropriately
    to the owner's combat state, such as adjusting behavior, targeting, or initiating
    actions based on the owner's engagement with enemies. It typically serves as part
    of the AI's response system to maintain tactical coherence between the creature
    and its owner during combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity ID that the
      owner is currently engaging in combat with. This value may be NULL if no valid
      target exists.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Interaction Handling
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnOwnerCombatInteraction(int* target)\n{\n    if (target\
      \ && *target != 0)\n    {\n        // Set the creature to follow and assist\
      \ the owner's target\n        AttackStart(*target);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n\
      \        // No valid target, stop attacking\n        me->AttackStop();\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the creature AI's main update
    loop or combat state handlers. It should not be used to directly modify the owner's
    combat state, but rather to react to changes in that state.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly validated before dereferencing
    it to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. The method may be invoked
    frequently during combat, so performance considerations are important.
