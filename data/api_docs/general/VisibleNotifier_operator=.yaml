  class: VisibleNotifier
  method: operator=
  signature: VisibleNotifier & VisibleNotifier::operator=(VisibleNotifier && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of one VisibleNotifier object to another, leaving the
    source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment on the VisibleNotifier
    class, transferring ownership of resources from the source object (param0) to
    the current object. This operation is typically used to efficiently transfer the
    internal state and data members of one VisibleNotifier instance to another without
    unnecessary copying. The move assignment is particularly useful in scenarios where
    objects are being reassigned or returned from functions, as it avoids expensive
    deep copies. After the move, the source object will be left in a valid but unspecified
    state, meaning it can still be safely destroyed or assigned to again, but its
    contents should not be relied upon.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The rvalue reference to another VisibleNotifier object whose contents
      will be moved to this object. This parameter represents the source of the move
      operation and is typically a temporary object or an explicitly moved object.
  returns: A reference to the current VisibleNotifier object (this) after the move
    assignment has been completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'VisibleNotifier notifier1;

      VisibleNotifier notifier2 = std::move(notifier1); // Uses move constructor

      // Later in code:

      notifier1 = std::move(notifier2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Function Return with Move Assignment
    code: "VisibleNotifier createNotifier() {\n    VisibleNotifier notifier;\n   \
      \ // ... populate notifier ...\n    return notifier; // Move semantics used\
      \ for return\n}\n\nvoid someFunction() {\n    VisibleNotifier notifier1 = createNotifier();\n\
      \    VisibleNotifier notifier2;\n    notifier2 = std::move(notifier1); // Move\
      \ assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation for the VisibleNotifier
    class. It's important to understand that after a move operation, the source object
    is left in a valid but unspecified state. The performance benefit comes from avoiding
    deep copying of internal data structures, which can be significant for objects
    containing large amounts of data or complex resource management.
  warnings: Be cautious when using move assignment on objects that may still be referenced
    elsewhere in the code. After a move operation, the source object should not be
    used unless it's explicitly assigned to again. Also, ensure that any resources
    managed by the VisibleNotifier are properly handled during the move operation
    to prevent resource leaks or undefined behavior.
