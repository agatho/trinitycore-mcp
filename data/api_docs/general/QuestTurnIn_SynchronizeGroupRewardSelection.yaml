  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: SynchronizeGroupRewardSelection
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::SynchronizeGroupRewardSelection(Group * group, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes quest reward selection for all group members when a quest is
    turned in.
  description: The SynchronizeGroupRewardSelection method ensures that all players
    within a specified group who have the same quest active receive consistent reward
    selection data after a quest turn-in event. This method is typically invoked when
    a group leader or member completes a quest that offers group-reward options, such
    as loot distribution or spell rewards. It handles the coordination of reward choices
    across multiple players to maintain game state consistency and prevent desynchronization
    in group-based quest completion mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose reward selections
      need synchronization. Must be a valid group instance with at least one member.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which reward selection is
      being synchronized. Must correspond to a valid active quest in the group members'
      quest log.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Synchronizing Group Reward Selection After Quest Completion
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ questId = 12345;\n    sQuestTurnIn->SynchronizeGroupRewardSelection(playerGroup,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group members are within the same zone and have
    the quest active in their quest log. It does not perform validation on whether
    the quest is actually completed or if rewards are available; it only synchronizes
    existing reward selections.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid group pointer or an invalid quest
    ID may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group contains
    valid players and that the quest exists before calling this function.
