  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: Update
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the group coordinator's internal state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the internal state of
    the GroupCoordinator class by processing any pending operations or events that
    are time-dependent. This typically involves checking and updating group member
    statuses, handling loot distribution timers, managing group invitations, or performing
    other time-sensitive group coordination tasks. The method accepts a time delta
    parameter representing milliseconds since the last update call, which is used
    to determine if any timed actions should be executed. This method is usually called
    from the main game loop or a dedicated update thread to ensure that group-related
    activities are processed in a timely manner.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since the last call to this Update
      method. This value is used to determine when timed events should be triggered
      or updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastDiff();\n    groupCoordinator->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with World Update Cycle
    code: "class World\n{\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Other world updates...\n        groupCoordinator->Update(diff);\n        //\
      \ Other world updates...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game thread and should not
    be called from multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization.
    The internal implementation may use the diff parameter to schedule or execute
    time-based group activities such as loot timer expiration, group invitation timeouts,
    or automatic disbanding of inactive groups.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid time deltas (e.g., negative values)
    as it may cause unexpected behavior in timed operations. This method should only
    be called during the game loop where timing is consistent and predictable.
