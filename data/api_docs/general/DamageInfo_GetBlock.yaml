  method: GetBlock
  signature: uint32 DamageInfo::GetBlock() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the amount of damage blocked by the target during a physical attack.
  description: The GetBlock method retrieves the total amount of physical damage that
    was successfully blocked by the target unit during a melee or ranged attack. This
    value represents the portion of the damage that was absorbed by the target's blocking
    mechanism, such as a shield or defensive stance. The returned value is typically
    used in combat calculations to determine the final damage dealt after blocking
    is applied. This method is commonly called within damage processing routines and
    combat log systems to accurately track blocked damage contributions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the amount of physical damage that
    was blocked by the target. A return value of 0 indicates no damage was blocked,
    while any positive value represents the actual blocked damage amount.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat processing
    code: "void HandleDamageCalculation(DamageInfo* damageInfo)\n{\n    uint32 blockedAmount\
      \ = damageInfo->GetBlock();\n    if (blockedAmount > 0)\n    {\n        // Apply\
      \ blocked damage to combat log\n        sLog->outString(\"Target blocked %u\
      \ damage.\", blockedAmount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking block effectiveness in damage calculation
    code: "uint32 CalculateFinalDamage(DamageInfo* damageInfo)\n{\n    uint32 totalDamage\
      \ = damageInfo->GetDamage();\n    uint32 blockedDamage = damageInfo->GetBlock();\n\
      \    \n    // Ensure we don't go below zero\n    uint32 finalDamage = (totalDamage\
      \ > blockedDamage) ? (totalDamage - blockedDamage) : 0;\n    \n    return finalDamage;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after damage processing has been completed
    and block calculations have been applied. The returned value is typically set
    during the attack's damage application phase when blocking mechanics are evaluated.
    In some cases, this value may be zero if the target did not have a blocking ability
    active or if the attack was not subject to blocking.
  warnings: Do not use this method before damage has been fully processed, as it may
    return incorrect or uninitialized values. The block amount returned represents
    only physical damage and does not account for other damage reduction mechanisms
    such as armor or spell resistance.
