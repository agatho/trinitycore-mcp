  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: ExecuteLevelStrategy
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::ExecuteLevelStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the level-based quest strategy for the specified player bot, determining
    and assigning appropriate quests based on the bot's current level and progression.
  description: The ExecuteLevelStrategy method is responsible for dynamically selecting
    and assigning quests to a player bot based on their current level and game progression.
    This method evaluates the bot's character state, including experience points,
    quest completion history, and available quest givers in the vicinity. It determines
    which quests are appropriate for the bot's level range and ensures that quest
    assignments align with standard World of Warcraft quest progression mechanics.
    The method typically integrates with the broader DynamicQuestSystem to provide
    adaptive questing behavior that enhances automated gameplay for bots or AI-controlled
    characters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the level
      strategy will be executed. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid player character with proper initialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid initialized bot

      DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;

      questSystem.ExecuteLevelStrategy(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Management
    code: "void UpdateBotQuests(Player* bot)\n{\n    if (bot && bot->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;\n        questSystem.ExecuteLevelStrategy(bot);\n\
      \        // Additional logic to handle quest state changes\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during periodic updates or when a bot's
    level changes. It may interact with internal quest databases and quest giver systems
    to ensure valid quest assignments. The implementation assumes that the player
    object has been properly initialized with relevant data such as level, experience,
    and quest log state.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player* parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method modifies the bot's quest state, so it should be used carefully in
    contexts where quest integrity is important.
