  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: MoveToNPC
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::MoveToNPC(Creature * npc)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates movement of the player to the specified NPC for interaction.
  description: 'The MoveToNPC method is responsible for initiating the player''s movement
    toward a given Creature (NPC) within the game world. It typically handles pathfinding
    and movement logic to ensure the player reaches the NPC''s location. This method
    is commonly used in quest interactions, vendor transactions, or other NPC-related
    activities where player proximity is required. The method returns true if the
    movement initiation was successful, and false otherwise. Precondition: The provided
    Creature pointer must be valid and represent an active NPC within the game world.'
  parameters:
  - name: npc
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC to move towards.
      Must not be null and must point to a valid, active NPC in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if movement to the NPC was successfully initiated; otherwise
    returns false. This may occur if the NPC is invalid, out of range, or if movement
    cannot be started due to game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement to NPC
    code: "if (interactionManager->MoveToNPC(npc)) {\n    // Movement initiated successfully\n\
      \    // Proceed with interaction logic\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate\
      \ movement\n    // Handle error or notify player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Movement with Error Handling
    code: "Creature* targetNpc = GetNPCByEntry(12345);\nif (targetNpc && interactionManager->MoveToNPC(targetNpc))\
      \ {\n    // Successfully started moving to NPC\n    player->SetFacingToObject(targetNpc);\n\
      \    // Continue with dialogue or action\n} else {\n    // Either NPC not found\
      \ or movement failed\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Unable to move to the target NPC.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal AI pathfinding and movement state changes.
    It does not guarantee that the player will reach the NPC; it only initiates the
    movement sequence. The actual arrival may require additional handling or event
    callbacks.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed is valid and represents an active
    NPC to prevent undefined behavior. Calling this method on a destroyed or invalid
    NPC can lead to crashes or unexpected results.
