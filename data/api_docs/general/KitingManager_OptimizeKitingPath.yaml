  class: KitingManager
  method: OptimizeKitingPath
  signature: void KitingManager::OptimizeKitingPath()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the kiting path for a player or creature based on environmental
    factors and target positioning.
  description: The OptimizeKitingPath method calculates and updates the most efficient
    movement trajectory for a unit to maintain optimal distance from an enemy while
    continuing to deal damage or perform actions. This method is typically used in
    AI-driven kiting behaviors where maintaining distance is crucial for survival
    or damage output. It evaluates factors such as target position, movement speed,
    attack range, and environmental obstacles to determine the best path. The optimization
    process may involve calculating waypoints, adjusting movement direction, or modifying
    speed to ensure continuous engagement without closing too far or too close to
    the target.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_kitingManager)\n       \
      \ m_kitingManager->OptimizeKitingPath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State
    code: "void KitingManager::UpdateCombatMovement()\n{\n    if (IsInCombat() &&\
      \ GetTarget() && !IsMoving())\n        OptimizeKitingPath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI updates to ensure dynamic
    path adjustments. It may trigger movement changes that affect the unit's current
    action state, so it's recommended to call this method before any movement-related
    actions. The optimization is based on static and dynamic factors, but does not
    account for sudden environmental changes like terrain modifications or temporary
    obstacles.
  warnings: Calling OptimizeKitingPath while a unit is already in motion may cause
    abrupt direction changes that could interrupt ongoing attacks or spells. Ensure
    proper state management to avoid conflicts with other movement systems. This method
    assumes the target exists and is valid; calling it without a valid target may
    result in undefined behavior.
