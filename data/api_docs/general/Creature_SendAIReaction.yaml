  class: Creature
  method: SendAIReaction
  signature: void Creature::SendAIReaction(int reactionType)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers an AI reaction for the creature based on the specified reaction
    type.
  description: This method sends an AI reaction to the creature, allowing it to respond
    to specific events or triggers within the game world. The reactionType parameter
    determines how the creature's AI will behave in response to the trigger. This
    functionality is commonly used in conjunction with other AI-related methods to
    manage creature behavior during combat or quest interactions. The method operates
    within the context of TrinityCore's AI system and should be used carefully to
    avoid unexpected behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: reactionType
    description: An integer value representing the type of AI reaction to trigger.
      Valid values typically include 0-255, where 0 usually indicates a default reaction,
      and higher values may represent different specific reactions like attack, flee,
      or follow.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Reaction Trigger
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->SendAIReaction(1);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced AI Reaction with Custom Logic
    code: "if (player->GetDistance(creature) < 5)\n{\n    creature->SendAIReaction(2);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    creature->SendAIReaction(0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI methods like 'AIUpdate'
    or 'SetReactType'. The reaction type should be carefully chosen to ensure proper
    behavior. Implementation may vary based on creature's current AI state and game
    context.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected creature behavior,
    including incorrect reactions during combat or quest events. Care should be taken
    when setting reaction types to avoid conflicts with existing AI logic.
