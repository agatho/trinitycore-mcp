documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the MaelstromTracker class with default values.
  description: The MaelstromTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    MaelstromTracker class. This class is typically used within the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to track and manage maelstrom-related mechanics,
    such as those associated with the Maelstrom spell effects or player abilities
    that generate maelstrom energy. The constructor sets up internal state variables
    and prepares the object for use in game logic. It ensures that all member variables
    are properly initialized to their default states before the object is used in
    gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MaelstromTracker instance
    code: 'MaelstromTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready for use in maelstrom mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or require external
    dependencies. It simply sets up the internal state of the MaelstromTracker object.
    Developers should be aware that this class may be used in conjunction with other
    maelstrom-related systems such as spell effects, player stats, or aura applications.
