documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of players in the map excluding Game Masterss
  description: This method retrieves the number of non-GM players present in the current
    map instance. It is commonly used for determining player population in zones,
    instances, or world maps to manage game mechanics such as player vs player (PvP)
    activities, quest completion, or instance difficulty scaling. The method excludes
    Game Masters (GM) from the count, ensuring accurate representation of regular
    player activity. This function is typically used in conjunction with other map-related
    methods to monitor player presence and manage game balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of players in the map who
    are not Game Masters. The value is zero when no players are present or when all
    players are GMs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 playerCount = map->GetPlayersCountExceptGMs();\nif (playerCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with logic based on player count\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be safely called from multiple threads.
    Performance impact is minimal as it only counts players in the map's active player
    list without additional processing.
  warnings: The method may return zero if no players are present or if all players
    are GMs, which could affect logic decisions in game systems that rely on player
    count.
