  class: Ticket
  method: IsFromPlayer
  signature: bool Ticket::IsFromPlayer(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the ticket was submitted by a specific player using their
    GUID.
  description: The IsFromPlayer method determines if a given ticket was originally
    submitted by a player with the specified global unique identifier (GUID). This
    utility function is typically used in ticket management systems to verify authorship
    of support tickets. The method performs a comparison between the internal player
    GUID stored within the ticket object and the provided GUID parameter. It's commonly
    employed in game master interfaces or administrative tools where it's necessary
    to filter or validate ticket ownership before taking action on a ticket.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check against
      the ticket's author. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from the game
      server's database or player session.
  returns: Returns true if the ticket was submitted by the player with the specified
    GUID; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Ticket Ownership
    code: "if (ticket->IsFromPlayer(playerGuid)) {\n    // Process ticket as owned\
      \ by this player\n    SendTicketResponse(ticket);\n} else {\n    // Deny access\
      \ or log unauthorized attempt\n    LogUnauthorizedAccess();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering Tickets by Player
    code: "std::vector<Ticket*> playerTickets;\nfor (auto& ticket : allTickets) {\n\
      \    if (ticket->IsFromPlayer(targetPlayerGuid)) {\n        playerTickets.push_back(ticket);\n\
      \    }\n}\n// Now playerTickets contains only tickets from the specified player"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ticket object has already been initialized with
    a valid player GUID. The implementation likely uses a cached or stored value rather
    than performing database lookups, making it efficient for frequent checks. It's
    important to note that GUIDs in TrinityCore are typically 32-bit integers representing
    player identifiers.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID is valid and corresponds to an actual player
    in the game world. Invalid GUIDs may lead to incorrect return values or unexpected
    behavior. Also, be aware that this method only checks against a single player's
    GUID; for multiple-player tickets, additional logic would be required.
