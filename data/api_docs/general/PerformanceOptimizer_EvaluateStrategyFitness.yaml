  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: EvaluateStrategyFitness
  signature: float PerformanceOptimizer::EvaluateStrategyFitness(uint32_t botGuid,
    const StrategyChromosome & chromosome)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the fitness of a given strategy chromosome for a specific bot GUID.
  description: The EvaluateStrategyFitness method computes a numerical fitness score
    for a specified bot's strategy chromosome. This score represents how well the
    strategy performs in the current game context, typically used in evolutionary
    algorithms or AI decision-making processes within TrinityCore. The method likely
    considers various performance metrics such as combat effectiveness, resource management,
    and task completion rates. It is designed to be called during AI strategy evaluation
    cycles where different strategies are compared and ranked. The fitness score can
    be used for selection, crossover, or mutation operations in genetic algorithms
    applied to bot behavior optimization.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose strategy fitness is
      being evaluated. This must correspond to a valid bot entity in the world.
  - name: chromosome
    description: The strategy chromosome containing the encoded behavioral parameters
      to be evaluated. This typically represents a complete set of AI decision rules
      or parameters for the bot's behavior.
  returns: A floating-point value representing the fitness score of the given strategy
    chromosome for the specified bot. Higher values indicate better-performing strategies.
    The exact scale and interpretation depend on the implementation, but typically
    ranges from 0.0 (worst) to some maximum positive value (best).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Fitness Evaluation
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      StrategyChromosome chromosome;

      // ... populate chromosome with strategy data ...

      float fitness = optimizer.EvaluateStrategyFitness(botGuid, chromosome);

      std::cout << "Fitness score: " << fitness << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Fitness Score for Strategy Selection
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nstd::vector<StrategyChromosome> strategies;\n\
      // ... populate strategies vector ...\nfloat bestFitness = -1.0f;\nStrategyChromosome\
      \ bestChromosome;\n\nfor (const auto& chrom : strategies) {\n    float fitness\
      \ = optimizer.EvaluateStrategyFitness(botGuid, chrom);\n    if (fitness > bestFitness)\
      \ {\n        bestFitness = fitness;\n        bestChromosome = chrom;\n    }\n\
      }\n// bestChromosome now contains the highest performing strategy"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely computationally intensive as it may involve simulating
    or analyzing bot behavior under various conditions. It should be called sparingly
    in performance-critical sections of code. The fitness evaluation might involve
    multiple game state checks and could potentially access shared resources, so thread
    safety considerations may apply if used from concurrent contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter corresponds to an active bot entity,
    as passing an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior or crashes. The chromosome
    data must be properly initialized and valid; otherwise, the fitness evaluation
    may produce unreliable results or throw exceptions.
