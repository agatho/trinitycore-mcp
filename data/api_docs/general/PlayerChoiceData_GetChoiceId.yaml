documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier for a player choice option.
  description: The GetChoiceId method returns the unique identifier associated with
    a specific player choice data entry. This identifier is used internally by the
    TrinityCore framework to distinguish between different choice options presented
    to players during quest interactions or dialogue sequences. The returned value
    typically corresponds to an entry in the playerchoice.dbc file or related database
    tables that define available choices for player interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the player
    choice. This ID is used to reference specific choice options within the game's
    data structures and database entries.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerChoiceData* choiceData = player->GetPlayerChoiceData();

      uint32 choiceId = choiceData->GetChoiceId();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("player.choice", "Current choice ID is: %u", choiceId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called on PlayerChoiceData objects that have been
    initialized with valid choice data. The returned ID should be used to query additional
    information about the choice from the appropriate database or DBC files.
