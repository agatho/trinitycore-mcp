  method: GetDeathTimer
  signature: uint32 Player::GetDeathTimer() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time in milliseconds remaining until a player's death is processed.
  description: The GetDeathTimer method returns the time in milliseconds that remains
    before a player's death is fully processed and their corpse is removed from the
    game world. This timer represents the duration between when a player dies and
    when their corpse expires, typically lasting 30 seconds in vanilla World of Warcraft.
    The method is commonly used to determine how long a player has before their corpse
    disappears, which affects resurrection mechanics and loot collection. It is particularly
    relevant for players who are in the process of dying or have recently died but
    not yet been resurrected.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an unsigned integer representing the time in milliseconds remaining
    until death processing completes. This value typically ranges from 0 to 30000
    milliseconds (30 seconds), with 0 indicating that death has already occurred and
    the corpse is about to be removed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 deathTimer = player->GetDeathTimer();\nif (deathTimer > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Player is still alive\n    // Wait for deathTimer milliseconds before\
      \ corpse expires\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other death-related methods
    like GetCorpse() or GetDeathState(). The timer may be affected by various game
    mechanics including resurrection sickness, player level, and server settings.
    It's important to note that this timer is not related to the player's actual health
    points but rather represents the time until their corpse expires.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining if a player is alive or
    dead in all cases; it only represents the time remaining until death processing
    completes. Be careful when using this method in conjunction with other death-related
    functions as it may lead to unexpected behavior if not properly handled.
