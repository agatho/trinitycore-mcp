  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotDatabasePool::Initialize(const std::string & connectionString,
    uint8 asyncThreads, uint8 syncThreads)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot database connection pool with specified connection string
    and thread configuration.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the database connection pool for bot-related
    operations within TrinityCore. It configures both asynchronous and synchronous
    threads to handle database requests efficiently. This method must be called before
    any bot database operations can be performed. The connection string specifies
    how to connect to the database, while asyncThreads and syncThreads define the
    number of worker threads for concurrent and sequential operations respectively.
    Proper initialization ensures that bot functionality can interact with the database
    without blocking game threads.
  parameters:
  - name: connectionString
    description: A string containing database connection parameters including host,
      port, username, password, and database name. Format typically follows 'mysql://user:password@host:port/database'
      or similar depending on the database backend.
  - name: asyncThreads
    description: Number of asynchronous worker threads to be created for handling
      non-blocking database operations. Must be a positive integer, typically between
      1-8 based on system capabilities.
  - name: syncThreads
    description: Number of synchronous worker threads to be created for handling blocking
      database operations. Must be a positive integer, typically between 1-4 based
      on system capabilities.
  returns: Returns true if the database pool was successfully initialized with all
    specified parameters and connections established; otherwise returns false if initialization
    failed due to invalid connection string, insufficient resources, or other configuration
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "if (!BotDatabasePool::Instance().Initialize(\"mysql://botuser:botpass@localhost:3306/trinity_bot\"\
      , 4, 2)) {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to initialize bot database pool\"\
      );\n    return false;\n}\nTC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Bot database pool initialized\
      \ successfully\");"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Error Handling
    code: "std::string connStr = \"mysql://root:password@127.0.0.1:3306/trinitycore_bot\"\
      ;\nuint8 asyncCount = 8;\nuint8 syncCount = 4;\n\nif (!BotDatabasePool::Instance().Initialize(connStr,\
      \ asyncCount, syncCount)) {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    std::cerr\
      \ << \"Failed to initialize bot database pool\" << std::endl;\n    return false;\n\
      }\n\n// Proceed with bot operations\nTC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Bot DB initialized\
      \ with %u async and %u sync threads\", asyncCount, syncCount);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when the bot system
    is first enabled. The database pool uses connection pooling to minimize overhead
    from repeated connection establishment. Async threads are used for operations
    that don't require immediate results, while sync threads handle critical operations
    that must complete before proceeding. The method blocks until all connections
    are established and verified.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    resource leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure the connection string is properly
    formatted and accessible before calling. Using too many threads can cause performance
    degradation due to context switching overhead. Always check the return value to
    confirm successful initialization.
