  method: ~BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::~BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized instance and cleans up all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized class is responsible
    for releasing all memory and resources that were allocated during the object's
    lifetime. This includes cleaning up any active bot sessions, freeing internal
    data structures, and ensuring proper shutdown of the session management system.
    The destructor ensures that no memory leaks occur when the manager is destroyed,
    which is crucial in a long-running application like a World of Warcraft server
    using TrinityCore. It should be called automatically when the object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction at scope end
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized sessionManager;\n\
      \    // ... use sessionManager ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of manager instance
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized* manager = new BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized();

      // ... use manager ...

      del manager; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is expected to be thread-safe and should not be called concurrently
    with other methods of the same instance. It's important that all bot sessions
    are properly terminated before destruction to avoid potential issues with active
    connections or pending operations.
  warnings: Calling the destructor directly on a stack-allocated object will result
    in undefined behavior if it's called more than once. Ensure that the destructor
    is only invoked once per instance, and that no other threads are accessing the
    manager during destruction.
