documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of available runes for the player's rune system
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the count of currently usable runes
    in the player's rune system. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this method is part of the RuneSystem class which manages the cooldown and availability
    of runes for Death Knights. The returned value represents how many runes can be
    consumed immediately without waiting for regeneration. This method does not modify
    any internal state and is typically used to determine if a player has sufficient
    runes before casting a spell that requires rune consumption.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of available runes in the player's
    rune system. This value typically ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 means no runes are
    available and 6 means all runes are ready for use.
  examples:
  - title: Check if player has enough runes before casting spell
    code: "uint32 availableRunes = player->GetRuneSystem()->GetAvailable();\nif (availableRunes\
      \ >= 2)\n{\n    // Player can cast a spell requiring 2 runes\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_DEATH_COIL, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Not enough runes, handle accordingly\n\
      \    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough runes available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method reflects the current state of rune availability at the time of
    invocation. The rune system in TrinityCore follows the standard WoW Death Knight
    rune mechanics where each rune has a cooldown period and regenerates over time.
    The returned value is updated by the game's internal rune regeneration system.
