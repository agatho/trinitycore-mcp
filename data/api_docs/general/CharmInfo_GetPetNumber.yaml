  signature: uint32 CharmInfo::GetPetNumber() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier number assigned to a pet within the CharmInfo
    system.
  description: The GetPetNumber method retrieves the internal numeric identifier associated
    with a pet controlled by a player. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore
    to track and manage pet instances, particularly in relation to charm effects and
    pet summoning mechanics. The returned value typically corresponds to the pet's
    entry in the database or its assigned GUID within the game world context. This
    method is commonly called when interacting with pet-related systems such as pet
    management, combat logic, or when determining pet-specific behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier number of the pet. This
    number is typically used internally by the server to reference specific pet instances
    and may correspond to database identifiers or internal tracking numbers.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Pet Number for Logging
    code: "void LogPetInfo(Player* player)\n{\n    if (Creature* pet = player->GetPet())\n\
      \    {\n        CharmInfo* charmInfo = pet->GetCharmInfo();\n        if (charmInfo)\n\
      \        {\n            uint32 petNumber = charmInfo->GetPetNumber();\n    \
      \        sLog->outString(\"Pet number: %u\", petNumber);\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CharmInfo object is valid and properly initialized.
    The pet number returned should not be confused with the creature's GUID, which
    is a separate identifier used for entity referencing in the game world.
