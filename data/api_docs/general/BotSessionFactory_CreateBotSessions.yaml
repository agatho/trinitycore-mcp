  signature: int BotSessionFactory::CreateBotSessions(const int & characterGuids,
    const int & baseRequest)
documentation:
  brief: Creates bot sessions for specified character GUIDs using a base request configuration
  description: The CreateBotSessions method initializes and configures bot sessions
    for multiple characters within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a list of character
    GUIDs and applies a base request configuration to each, effectively setting up
    automated player behavior for those characters. This method is typically used
    in bot management systems where multiple AI-controlled characters need to be initialized
    with consistent settings. The method performs validation on input parameters and
    returns a count of successfully created sessions. Precondition requires valid
    character GUIDs and a properly configured base request object.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuids
    description: Reference to an integer containing the GUID of the character for
      which bot sessions are to be created
  - name: baseRequest
    description: Reference to an integer representing the base request configuration
      that defines how bot sessions should be initialized
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the number of bot sessions successfully created.
    A return value of 0 indicates no sessions were created, while a positive integer
    represents the count of successful session creations. Negative values may indicate
    errors during the creation process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Session Creation
    code: "int characterGuid = 12345;\nint baseRequest = 1001;\nint result = botSessionFactory.CreateBotSessions(characterGuid,\
      \ baseRequest);\nif (result > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Successfully created\
      \ \" << result << \" bot sessions\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Batch Bot Session Creation with Error Handling
    code: "std::vector<int> characterGuids = {12345, 12346, 12347};\nint baseRequest\
      \ = 1001;\nfor (const auto& guid : characterGuids) {\n    int result = botSessionFactory.CreateBotSessions(guid,\
      \ baseRequest);\n    if (result < 0) {\n        std::cerr << \"Failed to create\
      \ bot session for character \" << guid << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the TrinityCore bot framework and requires proper
    initialization of the BotSessionFactory instance. The baseRequest parameter likely
    contains configuration data that defines bot behavior such as AI type, movement
    patterns, or interaction settings. Performance may be affected when creating sessions
    for large numbers of characters simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid character GUIDs or malformed base request
    configurations may result in undefined behavior or failed session creation. Ensure
    all input parameters are validated before calling this method to prevent runtime
    errors.
