  brief: Moves the interrupt awareness state from another InterruptAwareness object
    to this one.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers the interrupt awareness state
    from a source InterruptAwareness object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where an InterruptAwareness object needs to be
    reassigned to a new value without copying the underlying data, which can improve
    performance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations and copies. The method
    is part of the standard C++ move semantics implementation for the InterruptAwareness
    class, allowing efficient resource management when dealing with temporary objects
    or when reassigning interrupt awareness states within the World of Warcraft TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current InterruptAwareness object after the move assignment
    has been completed, enabling method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness1;

      InterruptAwareness awareness2 = std::move(awareness1); // Move assignment

      // awareness1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Function Context
    code: "InterruptAwareness createAwareness() {\n    InterruptAwareness temp;\n\
      \    // ... initialize temp ...\n    return temp; // Move semantics automatically\
      \ used\n}\n\nInterruptAwareness mainAwareness = createAwareness(); // Move assignment\
      \ from temporary"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented as a move operation, which means it
    will transfer ownership of resources rather than copying them. The source object
    after the move should be left in a valid but unspecified state. This implementation
    follows standard C++ move semantics and is optimized for performance in game systems
    where interrupt awareness tracking may be frequently reassigned.
  warnings: After calling this move assignment operator, the source object should
    not be used in any way that might access its previous state, as it has been moved
    from and is left in a valid but unspecified state. Improper use of the moved-from
    object can lead to undefined behavior or unexpected results in interrupt handling
    logic.
