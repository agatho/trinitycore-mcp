  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: HasTraj
  signature: bool SpellCastTargets::HasTraj() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell cast targets include a trajectory component.
  description: The HasTraj method checks if the SpellCastTargets object contains a
    trajectory, which is typically used for spells that require a specific flight
    path or projectile movement between the caster and target. This method is crucial
    for determining how a spell should be visually represented and physically calculated
    in the game world. The presence of a trajectory often indicates that the spell
    will follow a curved or direct path rather than an instantaneous effect.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell cast targets contain a trajectory component,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the spell requires projectile movement
    or flight path calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Trajectory Before Casting
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// ... set up targets ...\nif (targets.HasTraj())\
      \ {\n    // Handle trajectory-based spell logic\n    // e.g., projectile spawning,\
      \ path calculation\n}\nelse {\n    // Handle direct-target spell logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell processing to determine if a spell
    should be treated as a ranged attack with projectile movement. The trajectory
    information is typically set when targets are initialized with specific positioning
    data that indicates movement from caster to target.
