  class: QuestCompletion
  method: CompleteQuestDialog
  signature: void QuestCompletion::CompleteQuestDialog(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a quest dialog for the specified player and quest ID.
  description: The CompleteQuestDialog method is responsible for finalizing a quest
    completion process for a given player. It handles the necessary game state updates,
    reward distribution, and quest status changes required when a player finishes
    a quest. This method typically gets invoked when a player interacts with a quest
    giver NPC to turn in quest items or complete quest objectives. The method ensures
    that all quest-related data is properly updated within the player's quest log
    and that any associated rewards are awarded.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is completing
      the quest dialog.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest being completed. Must correspond to
      a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestCompletion::CompleteQuestDialog(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Completion
    code: "if (player->GetQuestStatus(questId) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n    QuestCompletion::CompleteQuestDialog(player,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already met all quest requirements
    and that the quest is in a state where it can be completed. The actual reward
    distribution and quest log updates are handled internally by this method. It's
    recommended to verify quest status before calling this method to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the player has completed all quest
    objectives may result in incomplete or incorrect quest progression. This method
    should only be called for valid, active quests that have been properly initialized.
