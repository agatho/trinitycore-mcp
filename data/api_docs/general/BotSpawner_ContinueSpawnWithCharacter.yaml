  class: BotSpawner
  method: ContinueSpawnWithCharacter
  signature: void BotSpawner::ContinueSpawnWithCharacter(int characterGuid, const
    int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Continues the bot spawning process using the provided character GUID and
    request data.
  description: The ContinueSpawnWithCharacter method is responsible for resuming or
    continuing the bot spawning workflow within the TrinityCore framework. It takes
    a character GUID and a reference to a request object, likely containing spawn
    parameters or configuration details. This method is typically invoked as part
    of an asynchronous or multi-step spawning process where initial setup has been
    completed but finalization or continuation requires additional data. The method
    operates on the internal state of the BotSpawner class and may involve database
    interactions, packet sending, or character creation logic depending on the implementation
    context.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character associated with the
      bot to be spawned. This value is used to track and manage the bot's state within
      the system.
  - name: request
    description: A constant reference to an integer representing the spawn request
      identifier or configuration data. This parameter likely holds information about
      how the bot should be spawned, such as spawn location, faction, or other attributes.
  returns: This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner;

      int guid = 12345;

      const int request = 67890;

      spawner.ContinueSpawnWithCharacter(guid, request);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger asynchronous bot spawning system.
    It assumes that the character GUID and request data are valid and properly initialized
    before being passed to it. The internal implementation may involve database queries
    or communication with the game server's core systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the characterGuid and request parameters are correctly set
    before calling this method, as invalid values could lead to unexpected behavior
    or errors in the spawning process.
