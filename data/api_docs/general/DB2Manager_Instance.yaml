  class: DB2Manager
  method: Instance
  signature: DB2Manager & DB2Manager::Instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the DB2Manager class for accessing database
    table definitions.
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern to provide global
    access to the DB2Manager, which is responsible for managing and caching database
    table definitions (DB2 files) used by TrinityCore. This manager handles loading,
    parsing, and providing access to various game data tables such as creature templates,
    item templates, and other static game data. The method ensures that only one instance
    of DB2Manager exists throughout the application lifecycle, making it thread-safe
    for concurrent access. It is commonly used by systems that require lookup of static
    game data from DB2 files without having to manage the manager's instantiation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single DB2Manager instance, allowing direct access to
    its methods and data members for retrieving DB2 table information and cached data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing DB2 Manager Instance
    code: 'DB2Manager& db2Manager = DB2Manager::Instance();

      // Now use db2Manager to access DB2 table definitions

      uint32 entry = db2Manager.GetCreatureTemplate(12345)->Entry;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is implemented as a singleton and should be used carefully in
    multi-threaded environments. The DB2Manager instance is typically initialized
    during server startup and remains valid throughout the application lifetime. Accessing
    this instance from different threads is safe, but modifications to DB2 data should
    be synchronized.
