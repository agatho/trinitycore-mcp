  brief: Deletes a guild rank from the player's guild
  description: Handles the client request to delete a specific guild rank within the
    player's guild. This method processes the packet sent by the client containing
    information about which rank to delete, validates that the player has sufficient
    permissions (typically requires guild leader status), and performs the necessary
    database operations to remove the rank. The operation affects the guild's rank
    hierarchy and may impact existing members assigned to that rank.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildDeleteRank(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildDeleteRank&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Validate player is in a guild\n    if (!GetPlayer()->GetGuild())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Process the rank deletion request\n    GetPlayer()->GetGuild()->DeleteRank(packet.RankId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a guild leader attempts to remove a
    rank from their guild's hierarchy. The operation modifies both in-memory guild
    data and persistent storage. It's important to ensure that no members are assigned
    to the rank being deleted, or those assignments should be handled appropriately
    before deletion.
  warnings: Deleting a rank can have cascading effects on guild member permissions.
    Ensure that any members assigned to the rank being deleted are either reassigned
    to another rank or their permissions are adjusted accordingly to prevent unintended
    access issues.
