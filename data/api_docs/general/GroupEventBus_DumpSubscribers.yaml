documentation:
  brief: Dumps all registered subscribers from the group event bus to the log output.
  description: The DumpSubscribers method is used for debugging and monitoring purposes,
    printing a list of all currently subscribed handlers to the system's log. This
    method does not modify any internal state but provides visibility into which components
    are listening for events within the group event bus. It is typically invoked during
    development or troubleshooting to verify that expected subscribers are properly
    registered. The output includes information about each subscriber such as their
    type, identifier, and registration status. This functionality is particularly
    useful in multi-threaded environments where event handling behavior needs to be
    validated.

  - title: Basic Usage for Debugging
    code: GroupEventBus::Instance()->DumpSubscribers();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be used in development or debug builds due to its
    performance impact from logging all subscribers. It is not thread-safe and may
    produce inconsistent results if other threads are modifying the subscriber list
    concurrently.
  warnings: Calling this method in production environments can significantly degrade
    performance due to extensive logging. Avoid using it during high-traffic periods
    or in performance-critical sections of code.
