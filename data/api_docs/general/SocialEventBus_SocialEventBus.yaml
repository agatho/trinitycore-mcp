  method: SocialEventBus
  signature: void SocialEventBus::SocialEventBus()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the SocialEventBus class for handling social
    events in the game.
  description: The SocialEventBus constructor initializes the internal state and data
    structures required for managing social events within the TrinityCore framework.
    This includes setting up event listeners, initializing communication channels,
    and preparing the bus to process various social interactions such as friend requests,
    guild invitations, and group formations. The constructor ensures that all necessary
    resources are allocated and configured before the object can be used to dispatch
    or receive social events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a SocialEventBus Instance
    code: 'SocialEventBus eventBus;

      // The eventBus is now ready to handle social events'
    language: cpp
  notes: The SocialEventBus constructor should only be called once per instance. Multiple
    instantiations may lead to resource conflicts or unexpected behavior in the social
    event handling system. It's recommended to use a singleton pattern for this class
    to ensure consistent event processing.
  warnings: Do not call the constructor directly if the class is intended to be a
    singleton. The SocialEventBus should typically be accessed through a global accessor
    function or singleton interface to prevent multiple instances from being created.
