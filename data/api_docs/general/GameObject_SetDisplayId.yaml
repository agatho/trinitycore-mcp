  class: GameObject
  method: SetDisplayId
  signature: void GameObject::SetDisplayId(uint32 displayid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the display ID of the game object to change its visual appearance.
  description: The SetDisplayId method allows developers to modify the visual representation
    of a GameObject by changing its display ID. This is useful for altering how objects
    appear in the world, such as changing a treasure chest's model to show different
    items or updating a door's appearance. The method directly affects the object's
    visual state and can be used in conjunction with other methods that manipulate
    GameObject properties. It should be used carefully as it may affect client-side
    rendering and game mechanics related to object interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: displayid
    description: The new display ID to set for the GameObject. This value determines
      what model the object will show in the game world, and must correspond to a
      valid entry in the DBC display database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetDisplayId(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with object update
    code: 'GameObject* go = ObjectAccessor::GetGameObject(*player, guid);

      go->SetDisplayId(54321);

      go->UpdateObjectVisibility();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the GameObject's display ID field in the object
    data. It should be used with caution as changing display IDs may affect client-side
    rendering and could potentially cause visual inconsistencies if not properly handled.
    The method does not validate that the display ID is valid, so developers must
    ensure that the value corresponds to an existing display entry.
  warnings: Using invalid display IDs can result in visual glitches or client-side
    errors. This method should not be used during object creation or initialization
    as it may cause issues with object visibility updates. Avoid calling this method
    on objects that are currently being processed by the game server.
