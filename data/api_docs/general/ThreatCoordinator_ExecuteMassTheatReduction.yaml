documentation:
  brief: Reduces threat levels for all units in the current threat coordinator.
  description: The ExecuteMassTheatReduction method applies a global reduction to
    threat values across all units managed by the ThreatCoordinator. This function
    is typically invoked during specific game events or mechanics where it's necessary
    to lower overall aggression levels, such as when a boss becomes immune to damage
    or when a group is entering a safe zone. The method modifies internal threat tracking
    data structures without directly affecting unit behavior beyond updating their
    threat levels. It does not reset threat completely but rather scales down existing
    values according to predefined logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Event
    code: "void OnBossImmunityChange()\n{\n    sThreatCoordinator->ExecuteMassTheatReduction();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it affects all units within the
    threat coordinator's scope. It is recommended to verify that calling this function
    aligns with current game state and event logic. The implementation likely uses
    a scaling factor or percentage-based reduction rather than absolute value subtraction.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat may cause unexpected behavior
    if not properly synchronized with other threat management systems. Ensure no unit-specific
    threat updates are pending before invoking this function to prevent race conditions.
