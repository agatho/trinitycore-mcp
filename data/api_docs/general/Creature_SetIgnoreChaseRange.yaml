  signature: void Creature::SetIgnoreChaseRange(bool ignoreChaseRange)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature ignores chase range when following players.
  description: This method controls whether a creature will ignore the standard chase
    range limits when pursuing players. When set to true, the creature will not be
    restricted by normal chase range boundaries and can pursue players beyond typical
    distance limitations. This is particularly useful for creatures that need to follow
    players across large distances or when implementing custom AI behavior. The method
    affects the creature's movement and targeting behavior within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetIgnoreChaseRange(true);

      // Creature will now ignore chase range limits'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nif (creature)\n{\n    creature->SetIgnoreChaseRange(false);\n\
      \    // Creature will respect normal chase range limits\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely affects the creature''s AI behavior
    and movement logic. Performance considerations: Setting this flag may impact pathfinding
    and movement calculations. Thread safety: This method should be thread-safe as
    it modifies internal creature state.'
  warnings: This method should only be used when necessary, as it can cause creatures
    to behave unexpectedly in normal gameplay scenarios. Misuse can lead to creatures
    following players across unrealistic distances or failing to properly engage in
    combat.
