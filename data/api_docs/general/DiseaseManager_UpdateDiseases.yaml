  class: DiseaseManager
  method: UpdateDiseases
  signature: void DiseaseManager::UpdateDiseases(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active disease effects on the specified unit, applying damage
    and status changes.
  description: The UpdateDiseases method processes and applies all active disease
    effects currently affecting the target unit. It iterates through the unit's active
    disease auras, checking their duration and applying any necessary damage or debuff
    effects. This method is typically called during each update tick to ensure diseases
    are properly maintained and removed when their duration expires. The method handles
    both periodic damage application and status effect updates for diseases such as
    plague, poison, or other harmful conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose disease effects need to be updated.
      Must not be null and must represent a valid game entity with active disease
      auras.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update() {\n    for (auto& unit : m_units) {\n        if\
      \ (unit->HasDisease()) {\n            m_diseaseManager.UpdateDiseases(unit);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Disease Update for Specific Unit
    code: "Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(playerGuid);\nif (player &&\
      \ player->IsInWorld()) {\n    m_diseaseManager.UpdateDiseases(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the game's update loop.
    Developers should not call this directly unless implementing custom disease handling
    logic. The method internally manages aura expiration and damage application based
    on game mechanics such as spell power scaling and resistance checks.
  warnings: Do not call this method with null or invalid unit pointers, as it will
    likely cause a crash. Ensure the target unit is valid and in world before calling
    to prevent undefined behavior.
