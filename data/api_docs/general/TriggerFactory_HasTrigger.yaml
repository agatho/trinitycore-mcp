  method: HasTrigger
  signature: bool TriggerFactory::HasTrigger(const std::string & name) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a trigger with the specified name exists within the TriggerFactory.
  description: The HasTrigger method determines if a trigger with the given name has
    been registered or defined within the TriggerFactory instance. This method is
    commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to verify the existence of specific
    triggers before attempting to activate or manipulate them. It performs a lookup
    operation in an internal data structure that stores trigger definitions, returning
    true if the trigger exists and false otherwise. The method does not modify any
    state and is typically used as a safety check before invoking other trigger-related
    operations.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The string identifier of the trigger to search for. This should match
      the name used when registering the trigger with the factory.
  returns: Returns true if a trigger with the specified name exists in the factory,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Existence Check
    code: "if (triggerFactory.HasTrigger(\"PlayerEnterZone\")) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ trigger activation logic\n    triggerFactory.ActivateTrigger(\"PlayerEnterZone\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Trigger Handling
    code: "std::string triggerName = \"BossDeathEvent\";\nif (triggerFactory.HasTrigger(triggerName))\
      \ {\n    // Safe to proceed with trigger-specific actions\n    triggerFactory.ExecuteTrigger(triggerName);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where trigger is not defined\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Trigger '%s' not found in factory.\", triggerName.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a linear search through registered triggers, so performance
    may degrade with a large number of triggers. It is recommended to cache results
    if the same check is performed frequently. The implementation assumes that trigger
    names are unique and case-sensitive.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency scenarios as it may
    impact performance. Also, ensure that the trigger name passed matches exactly
    with how it was registered, including case sensitivity.
