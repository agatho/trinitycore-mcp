  method: UpdateCombatFollowing
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::UpdateCombatFollowing(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot's following behavior during combat based on the leader's
    actions and positioning.
  description: The UpdateCombatFollowing method manages how a bot character adjusts
    its movement and positioning relative to its leader while engaged in combat. This
    method is typically invoked during AI updates to ensure that the bot maintains
    an appropriate distance and formation with the leader, taking into account combat
    conditions such as threat levels, enemy proximity, and available space. It evaluates
    whether the bot should follow closely, maintain a safe distance, or reposition
    itself for optimal tactical benefit. The behavior may include adjusting movement
    speed, pathfinding, and decision-making logic to align with combat dynamics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n \
      \   if (m_leaderFollowBehavior)\n        m_leaderFollowBehavior->UpdateCombatFollowing(this);\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot's combat behavior system and relies on accurate
    state tracking of both the bot and its leader. It should be called regularly during
    the AI update cycle to ensure responsive and realistic following behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to bots becoming stuck, moving
    inappropriately, or failing to maintain proper formation during combat. Ensure
    that the leader's state is valid before calling this method.
