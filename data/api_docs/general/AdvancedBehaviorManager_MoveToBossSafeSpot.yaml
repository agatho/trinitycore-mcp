  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: MoveToBossSafeSpot
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::MoveToBossSafeSpot(Creature * boss)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the creature to a designated safe spot near the boss during combat.
  description: The MoveToBossSafeSpot method instructs a creature to navigate to a
    predetermined safe location adjacent to the boss entity. This functionality is
    typically used in advanced AI behaviors where positioning is critical for encounter
    mechanics, such as avoiding area-of-effect attacks or preparing for specific boss
    abilities. The method likely utilizes pathfinding algorithms to ensure smooth
    movement and may involve checking for obstacles or environmental constraints.
    It is commonly employed in scripted encounters where precise creature placement
    enhances gameplay balance and player experience.
  parameters:
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the boss entity. This
      parameter defines the target location for the safe spot positioning. Must not
      be null; otherwise, the method may fail or cause undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Behavior
    code: "void MyBossAI::ExecuteCombatStrategy()\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        Creature* boss = me->GetVictim();\n        if (boss)\n     \
      \   {\n            MoveToBossSafeSpot(boss);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Encounter Logic
    code: "void AdvancedBehaviorManager::HandlePhaseTransition(Creature* boss)\n{\n\
      \    // Ensure boss is valid before proceeding\n    if (!boss || !boss->IsInCombat())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Move to safe spot before initiating phase change\n\
      \    MoveToBossSafeSpot(boss);\n    \n    // Additional logic for phase transition\n\
      \    DoPhaseSpecificActions();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the creature has been properly initialized and is
    part of an active combat scenario. It relies on internal pathfinding systems,
    so performance may be affected by complex terrain or high server load. The safe
    spot coordinates are typically pre-defined within the AI behavior configuration.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the boss parameter will likely result in a
    crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the boss object is valid and in combat
    before invoking this method. Also, be cautious when calling this method during
    critical moments of combat to avoid interrupting ongoing animations or spell casts.
