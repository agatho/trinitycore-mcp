api:
  class: WorldSession
  method: SendAuthResponse
  signature: void WorldSession::SendAuthResponse(uint32 code, bool queued, uint32
    queuePos)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an authentication response to the client with login status, queue information,
    and position.
  description: The SendAuthResponse method is used by the WorldSession class to communicate
    the result of a player's authentication attempt back to the client. This includes
    whether the login was successful, if the player is queued due to server capacity,
    and their current position in the queue. The method handles the protocol-level
    response that informs the client about the authentication outcome and prepares
    them for either immediate connection or queuing.
  parameters:
  - name: code
    description: Authentication result code indicating login status. Common values
      include 0 (success), 1 (failure), and various queue-related codes.
  - name: queued
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player is currently queued for
      server access. True means the player must wait, false means they can proceed
      immediately.
  - name: queuePos
    description: Position in the authentication queue if the player is queued. Zero
      indicates no queue position, positive values represent the player's place in
      line.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Successful Authentication Response
    code: session->SendAuthResponse(0, false, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Player Queued for Login
    code: session->SendAuthResponse(2, true, 5);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client's authentication protocol
    and should only be called after processing login attempts. It may trigger additional
    session setup or cleanup operations depending on the response code provided.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper authentication validation can lead
    to incorrect client states or security vulnerabilities. Ensure that all parameters
    are validated before sending the response.
