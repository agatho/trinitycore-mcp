  method: SetFlag
  signature: void GameObject::SetFlag(int flags)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a flag on the GameObject to modify its behavior or state.
  description: The SetFlag method allows developers to modify specific flags associated
    with a GameObject, which control various aspects of its functionality within the
    game world. This method is commonly used to enable or disable certain properties
    of the GameObject, such as whether it's interactable, visible, or has specific
    behaviors. The flag value determines what type of modification occurs, and can
    be used in conjunction with other methods like GetFlag or ClearFlag to manage
    the GameObject's state effectively.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The flag value that will be set on the GameObject. This typically
      represents a specific bit within the GameObject's flags, and can be used to
      enable or disable certain behaviors or properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Flag for Interactable GameObject
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetFlag(GAMEOBJECT_FLAG_INTERACT);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Multiple Flags
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetFlag(GAMEOBJECT_FLAG_IN_USE | GAMEOBJECT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method typically modifies the internal flags
    of the GameObject, which are stored in a bitfield. The operation is usually performed
    directly on the GameObject''s flag member, and may require synchronization if
    used in multi-threaded environments. Performance considerations: Since this method
    modifies internal state, frequent calls may impact performance if not managed
    properly.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes include using incorrect flag values or not understanding
    the bitwise operations involved. Dangerous edge cases: Setting flags incorrectly
    can cause unexpected behavior in game mechanics, such as making a GameObject uninteractable
    when it should be interactable.'
