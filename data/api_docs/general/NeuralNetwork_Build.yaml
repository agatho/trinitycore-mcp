documentation:
  brief: Initializes and configures the neural network architecture with the specified
    input layer size
  description: The Build method initializes a neural network by setting up its basic
    architecture based on the provided input size. This method typically allocates
    memory for network layers, initializes weights and biases, and prepares the network
    structure for training or inference operations. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI systems, this method would be used to construct neural networks for various
    game-related tasks such as NPC behavior prediction, pathfinding optimization,
    or decision-making processes. The method assumes that all necessary configuration
    parameters have been set prior to invocation, and it does not validate input parameters
    beyond basic size constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Neural Network Construction
    code: 'NeuralNetwork network;

      network.Build(10); // Build network with 10 input neurons'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI System Initialization
    code: "void InitializeAI()\n{\n    NeuralNetwork aiBrain;\n    aiBrain.Build(50);\
      \ // Configure brain for 50-dimensional input space\n    // Further initialization\
      \ and training would follow\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per network instance. Subsequent calls
    may result in undefined behavior or memory leaks if not properly handled by the
    implementation. The method does not perform any validation of the inputSize parameter,
    so callers should ensure it represents a reasonable number of input features for
    their intended use case.
  warnings: Calling Build with an extremely large inputSize value may cause memory
    allocation failures or performance degradation. This method is typically not thread-safe
    and should be called from a single-threaded context during initialization phases.
