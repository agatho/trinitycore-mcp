  method: RogueAI
  signature: void RogueAI::RogueAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the RogueAI behavior for a bot character with specified parameters.
  description: The RogueAI constructor initializes the artificial intelligence system
    for a rogue-class bot in TrinityCore. This method sets up the core behavior patterns,
    decision-making logic, and combat strategies specific to rogue characters. It
    configures the bot's ability to perform stealth-based attacks, apply poisons,
    use daggers effectively, and manage energy resources during combat. The initialization
    process includes setting up target selection criteria, threat assessment mechanisms,
    and tactical decision trees that govern when to use abilities like Sinister Strike,
    Backstab, or Evasion.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic RogueAI Initialization
    code: 'RogueAI rogueAI;

      rogueAI.RogueAI(&bot);

      // Initializes the rogue AI for a bot character with default settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during bot initialization. The parameter
    'bot' must point to a valid GameObject or Unit instance representing the rogue
    character. The AI system will automatically manage behavior updates and state
    transitions without additional manual intervention.
  warnings: Do not call this method on non-rogue characters as it may cause undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the bot pointer is properly initialized before passing it
    to this constructor, otherwise the AI system will fail to initialize correctly.
