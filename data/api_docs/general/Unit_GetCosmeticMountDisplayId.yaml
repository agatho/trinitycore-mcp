  signature: uint32 Unit::GetCosmeticMountDisplayId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the cosmetic mount display ID for the unit.
  description: This method retrieves the display ID of the cosmetic mount associated
    with the unit, which is used to determine the visual appearance of mounts in the
    game. The returned value represents a unique identifier that corresponds to a
    specific mount model in the game's database. This method is commonly used for
    checking or setting cosmetic mount visuals for players and NPCs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the display ID of the cosmetic mount associated
    with the unit. This value typically corresponds to a specific mount model in the
    game's database, where 0 indicates no cosmetic mount is applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 mountDisplayId = unit->GetCosmeticMountDisplayId();\nif (mountDisplayId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // A cosmetic mount is set\n    // Do something with the display\
      \ ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify any internal state or perform any operations;
    it simply retrieves the current value. It is typically used in conjunction with
    other methods that handle mount display logic, such as SetCosmeticMountDisplayId
    or GetDisplayId.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns 0 when no cosmetic mount is set, which
    may be confused with a default mount. Ensure proper validation of the returned
    value to distinguish between no mount and default mount settings.
