  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::~BotLifecycleMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotLifecycleMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotLifecycleMgr class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any bot instances managed by the lifecycle manager, ensuring proper
    shutdown of bot-related systems, and preventing memory leaks. The destructor is
    automatically invoked when a BotLifecycleMgr object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. It ensures that all bot-related subsystems are properly terminated before
    the manager itself is destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotLifecycleMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotLifecycleMgr* mgr = new BotLifecycleMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor is called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It's important to ensure that all bot instances are properly terminated
    before this destructor runs to avoid potential resource leaks or undefined behavior.
