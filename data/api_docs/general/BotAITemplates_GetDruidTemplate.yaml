  method: GetDruidTemplate
  signature: BotAIConfig BotAITemplates::GetDruidTemplate(bool tank, bool healer)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the default Druid bot AI configuration for specified role types.
  description: The GetDruidTemplate method returns a BotAIConfig object that defines
    the default behavior and settings for a Druid class bot in the TrinityCore environment.
    This configuration includes spell selections, ability priorities, and tactical
    decisions tailored for Druid gameplay roles such as tanking or healing. The method
    accepts two boolean parameters to determine whether the returned template should
    be optimized for tanking or healing duties. This allows for flexible AI behavior
    customization based on the specific needs of a bot group or player party.
  parameters:
  - name: tank
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the returned template should prioritize
      tanking abilities and mechanics.
  - name: healer
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the returned template should prioritize
      healing abilities and mechanics.
  returns: A BotAIConfig object containing predefined AI settings, spell priorities,
    and behavior patterns specific to Druid class bots. The configuration will be
    optimized for either tanking, healing, or a balanced role based on the input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Get Tanking Druid Template
    code: 'BotAIConfig config = botTemplates.GetDruidTemplate(true, false);

      // Returns a configuration optimized for tanking duties'
    language: cpp
  - title: Get Healing Druid Template
    code: 'BotAIConfig config = botTemplates.GetDruidTemplate(false, true);

      // Returns a configuration optimized for healing duties'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during bot initialization or when dynamically
    switching roles within a group. The returned BotAIConfig object can be further
    customized by the calling code before being applied to a specific bot instance.
  warnings: Ensure that both tank and healer parameters are not set to true simultaneously
    unless the underlying implementation explicitly supports dual-role configurations,
    as this may result in undefined behavior or conflicting AI priorities.
