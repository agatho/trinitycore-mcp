  class: PreciseShotsTracker
  method: GetCharges
  signature: uint32 PreciseShotsTracker::GetCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of charges available for the Precise Shots ability.
  description: The GetCharges method returns the number of usable charges remaining
    for the Precise Shots talent or ability. This tracker is typically used in conjunction
    with abilities that have limited uses per combat encounter or cooldown period.
    The returned value represents how many times the ability can be activated before
    requiring a reset, which may occur after a certain duration or after specific
    game events such as taking damage or using other abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of charges currently available for
    use. A return value of zero indicates that no charges are currently available
    and the ability cannot be used until charges regenerate.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 charges = tracker->GetCharges();\nif (charges > 0)\n{\n    // Use\
      \ the Precise Shots ability\n    // ... implementation details\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Charges Before Activation
    code: "if (player->GetPreciseShotsTracker()->GetCharges() > 0)\n{\n    // Activate\
      \ the Precise Shots ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_PRECISE_SHOTS,\
      \ true);\n    player->GetPreciseShotsTracker()->UseCharge();\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   // Handle case when no charges are available\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You have no charges remaining for Precise Shots.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger tracking system for abilities with
    limited usage. The charge count may be modified by other methods such as UseCharge(),
    ResetCharges(), or RegenerateCharges(). It's important to note that the behavior
    of charge regeneration and reset conditions depends on the specific implementation
    within the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called in contexts where it could cause
    race conditions if multiple threads are modifying the charge state. Also, be aware
    that calling this method during combat may have performance implications depending
    on how often it's invoked.
