  class: BotAITemplates
  method: GetPaladinTemplate
  signature: BotAIConfig BotAITemplates::GetPaladinTemplate(bool tank, bool healer)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the configured AI template for a paladin bot, optionally tailored
    for tanking or healing roles.
  description: 'The GetPaladinTemplate method returns a BotAIConfig object that defines
    the behavior and decision-making logic for a paladin class bot within the TrinityCore
    framework. This configuration includes spell selections, ability priorities, targeting
    rules, and role-specific strategies such as whether the bot should focus on tanking
    or healing duties. The method accepts two boolean parameters to customize the
    returned template based on the desired playstyle: ''tank'' determines if the bot
    is configured for defensive roles like mitigation and threat generation, while
    ''healer'' specifies if it''s optimized for support and healing abilities. If
    neither parameter is true, a default paladin template is returned. This method
    is typically used during bot initialization or when switching roles dynamically
    in an AI-controlled party.'
  parameters:
  - name: tank
    description: When set to true, the returned template will be optimized for tanking
      behavior including threat generation, defensive cooldowns, and aggro management.
      When false, this parameter has no effect on the returned configuration.
  - name: healer
    description: When set to true, the returned template will prioritize healing abilities
      and support mechanics such as mana management and target selection for healing.
      When false, this parameter has no effect on the returned configuration.
  returns: A BotAIConfig object containing the AI behavior settings specific to a
    paladin class bot. The configuration includes spell priorities, targeting rules,
    and role-specific strategies. Returns a valid configuration object; no null or
    error conditions are expected.
  examples:
  - title: Get Default Paladin Template
    code: BotAIConfig config = botTemplates.GetPaladinTemplate(false, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Get Tanking Paladin Template
    code: BotAIConfig tankConfig = botTemplates.GetPaladinTemplate(true, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Get Healing Paladin Template
    code: BotAIConfig healConfig = botTemplates.GetPaladinTemplate(false, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotAITemplates class which manages predefined
    AI configurations for different classes and roles. The returned BotAIConfig objects
    are immutable once retrieved, meaning any modifications to their settings must
    be done through dedicated setter methods or by creating new configurations. Performance-wise,
    this method performs a lookup in an internal map of pre-defined templates, so
    it's efficient for repeated calls during bot initialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the parameters 'tank' and 'healer' are not both true simultaneously
    unless the system supports dual-role bots, as this may lead to undefined behavior
    or conflicting AI priorities. The method assumes valid input parameters; invalid
    usage could result in unexpected configurations being applied to the bot.
