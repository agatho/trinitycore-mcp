api:
  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: GetThreatReport
  signature: std::string ThreatCoordinator::GetThreatReport() const
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a formatted threat report string for all units in the
    current threat coordinator.
  description: The GetThreatReport method compiles a comprehensive threat assessment
    report that includes information about all units currently under the threat coordinator's
    management. This method aggregates data from various threat sources within the
    system to produce a human-readable summary of the current combat state. The returned
    string typically contains details such as unit GUIDs, threat levels, aggro status,
    and other relevant combat metrics. The method is primarily used for debugging,
    monitoring, or administrative purposes during gameplay or development testing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted threat report with information about
    all managed units, their threat levels, and related combat data. Returns an empty
    string if no units are being tracked or if the report cannot be generated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "std::string report = threatCoordinator.GetThreatReport();\nif (!report.empty())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Threat Report:\\n\" << report << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"No threat data available.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when called frequently due
    to the aggregation of multiple threat sources. It should be used judiciously in
    performance-critical code paths. The output format is designed for readability
    and debugging purposes, not for programmatic parsing.
  warnings: The method assumes that all units being tracked are valid and properly
    initialized. Calling this method on an uninitialized or corrupted ThreatCoordinator
    instance may result in undefined behavior or incomplete reports.
