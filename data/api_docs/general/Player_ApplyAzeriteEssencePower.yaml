  brief: Applies an Azerite essence power to a player's item.
  description: This method applies an Azerite essence power to a player's item, modifying
    the item's properties based on the specified power entry. The method handles both
    major and minor essence powers, allowing for precise control over how the Azerite
    essence affects the item. It is used in conjunction with the Azerite Essence system
    introduced in World of Warcraft, where players can enhance their gear with various
    Azerite powers to improve their character's performance.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the item that will receive the Azerite essence power.
      This parameter specifies which item to modify and is essential for proper application
      of the power.
  - name: azeriteEssencePower
    description: Pointer to the AzeriteEssencePowerEntry structure defining the specific
      power to apply. This entry contains the details about the Azerite essence power,
      including its ID, effects, and properties.
  - name: major
    description: Boolean indicating whether the applied power is a major or minor
      Azerite essence power. Major powers typically provide more significant effects
      compared to minor ones.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean indicating whether to apply or remove the Azerite essence
      power from the item. True applies the power, false removes it.
  returns: null

  notes: This method is part of the Azerite system implementation and requires careful
    handling of item references. It should be used with caution to avoid unintended
    modifications to player items.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect item modifications or
    even game crashes if the item pointer is invalid or the power entry is not properly
    initialized.
