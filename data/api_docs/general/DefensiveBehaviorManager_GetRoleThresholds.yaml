  method: GetRoleThresholds
  signature: RoleThresholds DefensiveBehaviorManager::GetRoleThresholds(uint8 role)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the threshold values associated with a specified role for defensive
    behavior calculations.
  description: The GetRoleThresholds method retrieves a structured set of threshold
    values that define how an AI-controlled unit should behave in defensive situations
    based on its assigned role. These thresholds typically include health percentages,
    threat levels, and other metrics used to determine when defensive actions should
    be triggered. The method takes a single role identifier as input and returns a
    RoleThresholds structure containing the relevant configuration values. This functionality
    is crucial for implementing intelligent defensive AI that adapts its behavior
    based on predefined role-based parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A RoleThresholds structure containing the threshold values associated with
    the specified role. The structure likely includes fields such as health thresholds,
    threat levels, and other behavioral triggers used by the defensive AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve thresholds for tank role
    code: "RoleThresholds thresholds = behaviorManager.GetRoleThresholds(ROLE_TANK);\n\
      if (thresholds.healthThreshold > 0)\n{\n    // Use thresholds to determine when\
      \ to activate defensive stance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses pre-configured role data stored in the AI behavior
    system. The returned RoleThresholds structure should be treated as read-only since
    it represents static configuration data for each role.
  warnings: Ensure that the role parameter passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to a defined role within the defensive behavior system, otherwise undefined behavior
    may occur.
