  class: QuestRequirementAnalyzer
  method: AnalyzeLevelRequirements
  signature: void QuestRequirementAnalyzer::AnalyzeLevelRequirements(const Quest *
    quest, Player * bot, int & issues)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes level requirements for a given quest and player, updating the issues
    counter with any violations.
  description: The AnalyzeLevelRequirements method evaluates whether a player meets
    the level prerequisites for a specified quest. It checks if the player's current
    level is sufficient to accept and complete the quest. The method modifies the
    issues parameter to reflect any level-related problems encountered during analysis.
    This function is typically used in automated quest validation systems or quest
    recommendation engines within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers. The
    analysis considers both minimum and maximum level requirements defined in the
    quest template.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing level requirement data to
      be analyzed. Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose level
      will be checked against quest requirements. Must not be null.
  - name: issues
    description: Reference to an integer that will be incremented for each level-related
      issue found during analysis. Should be initialized to zero before calling this
      method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Level Analysis
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nPlayer* player = bot;\n\
      int issueCount = 0;\nquestAnalyzer.AnalyzeLevelRequirements(quest, player, issueCount);\n\
      if (issueCount > 0) {\n    // Handle level requirement issues\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Found %d level-related issues with quest %d\", issueCount, quest->GetQuestId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest and player objects are valid and properly
    initialized. The issues counter is modified in-place and should be reset before
    each call if multiple quests are being analyzed. Performance is generally good
    for single quest analysis, but repeated calls on many quests may require optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that both quest and bot parameters are non-null to avoid undefined
    behavior. The method does not perform any automatic logging or error reporting;
    it only updates the issues counter which must be handled by the calling code.
