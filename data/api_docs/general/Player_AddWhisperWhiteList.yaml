    communication settings and ensure proper gameplay mechanics. This operation affects
    the player's ability to receive whispers from specific players.

  notes: This method is typically used in the context of player communication management
    and requires a valid GUID to function properly. It should be called with care
    as it affects the player's ability to receive whispers from others.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to communication issues or unexpected
    behavior in player interactions. Ensure that the GUID provided is valid and corresponds
    to an existing player.
