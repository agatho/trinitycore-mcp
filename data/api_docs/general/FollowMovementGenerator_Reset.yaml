  class: FollowMovementGenerator
  method: Reset
  signature: void FollowMovementGenerator::Reset(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the follow movement generator's state and clears any active follow
    instructions.
  description: The Reset method in FollowMovementGenerator is responsible for clearing
    the current follow behavior and resetting the movement generator to its initial
    state. This typically occurs when a unit stops following another unit, such as
    when the follower or target becomes invalid, the follow relationship is interrupted,
    or a new movement behavior needs to be initiated. The method ensures that any
    internal tracking data related to the follow movement is cleared and that the
    movement generator is ready to handle a new follow instruction if one is provided.
    This method is crucial for maintaining proper AI state management in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being reset. This represents the
      unit whose follow movement generator state is being cleared.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting a Follow Movement Generator
    code: 'Unit* follower = ...; // Some unit following another

      FollowMovementGenerator* followGen = new FollowMovementGenerator();

      followGen->Reset(follower); // Clear the current follow state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a follow
    behavior needs to be terminated or reset. It's important for memory management
    and preventing stale references in movement generators.
