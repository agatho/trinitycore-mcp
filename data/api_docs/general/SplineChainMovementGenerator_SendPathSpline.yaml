  class: SplineChainMovementGenerator
  method: SendPathSpline
  signature: int SplineChainMovementGenerator::SendPathSpline(Unit * owner, float
    velocity, const int & path) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a spline-based movement path to the specified unit for execution.
  description: The SendPathSpline method initiates a spline-based movement animation
    for a given unit, using a predefined path index and velocity. This method is typically
    used in AI or movement logic to control how units move along complex paths, such
    as waypoints or scripted sequences. It leverages the TrinityCore's spline movement
    system to ensure smooth and accurate motion. The method operates on the provided
    owner unit and applies the specified velocity to determine the speed of the movement.
    It returns an integer indicating success or failure status of the operation.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will execute the spline movement.
      This is the entity whose movement will be controlled by the path.
  - name: velocity
    description: The speed at which the unit should move along the spline path, specified
      in game units per second. Must be a positive value.
  - name: path
    description: Reference to an integer representing the index of the predefined
      path to be used for movement. This index corresponds to a specific spline chain
      defined elsewhere in the system.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the result of the operation. A return value
    of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values may indicate errors such
    as invalid parameters or missing path data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to move a unit along a predefined path
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // some unit\nint pathIndex = 5;\nfloat speed = 3.0f;\n\
      int result = movementGenerator.SendPathSpline(target, speed, pathIndex);\nif\
      \ (result == 0) {\n    // Movement started successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying spline movement system and assumes that
    the path referenced by 'path' has been properly initialized. The velocity parameter
    directly affects how quickly the unit moves along the path, so it should be set
    appropriately for the desired gameplay effect.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'owner' pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Also, verify that the path index corresponds to a valid spline chain;
    otherwise, the method may fail or produce unexpected behavior.
