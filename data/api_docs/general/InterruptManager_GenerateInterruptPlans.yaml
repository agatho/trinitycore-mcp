documentation:
  brief: Generates interrupt plans for target entities based on current AI state and
    combat conditions
  description: The GenerateInterruptPlans method calculates and prepares interrupt
    strategies for specified targets within the game world. This method is typically
    used by AI systems to determine optimal timing and conditions for interrupting
    enemy spell casts or actions. It evaluates various factors including target position,
    spell casting status, player abilities, and combat context to create a list of
    viable interrupt opportunities. The generated plans are usually stored internally
    for later execution or may be returned as a data structure for external processing.
    This method is essential for AI-driven characters that need to strategically interrupt
    enemy actions during combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: targets
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of targets to generate
      interrupt plans for. This parameter likely determines how many potential interrupt
      opportunities are calculated and prepared.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure status of plan
    generation. A positive value typically indicates successful plan creation, while
    negative values may represent errors such as invalid target count, insufficient
    resources, or AI state conflicts. The exact meaning of specific return codes should
    be determined by examining the implementation or related documentation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic interrupt plan generation
    code: "InterruptManager* interruptMgr = player->GetInterruptManager();\nint targetCount\
      \ = 3;\nint result = interruptMgr->GenerateInterruptPlans(targetCount);\nif\
      \ (result > 0) {\n    // Plans generated successfully\n    printf(\"Generated\
      \ %d interrupt plans\\n\", result);\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n  \
      \  printf(\"Failed to generate interrupt plans: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system and may depend on other
    subsystems like threat management, spell tracking, or combat state evaluation.
    The actual interrupt planning logic may involve complex calculations based on
    spell durations, cooldowns, and character abilities. Performance considerations
    should be noted as this method might be called frequently during combat scenarios.
  warnings: The method signature indicates a reference parameter which could lead
    to unexpected behavior if the value is modified externally. Ensure that the targets
    parameter contains valid values before calling this method. The return value interpretation
    may vary based on implementation details, so careful testing is recommended.
