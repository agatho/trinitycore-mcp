documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell ID associated with a wildfire bomb.
  description: The GetBombSpell method returns the unique identifier (spell ID) of
    the spell that is used to create or manage wildfire bombs in the game. This method
    is typically used within the context of abilities or effects that spawn explosive
    projectiles, such as those found in certain class specializations or world events.
    The returned value corresponds to a specific spell entry defined in the game's
    spell database and is essential for triggering the correct visual effects, damage
    calculations, and gameplay mechanics associated with wildfire bombs.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 representing the spell ID of the wildfire bomb. This identifier
    maps directly to an entry in the Spell.dbc file and defines how the spell behaves,
    including its effects, duration, and visual appearance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 bombSpellId = wildfireBombManager.GetBombSpell();\nif (bombSpellId)\n\
      {\n    // Use the spell ID to cast or apply the wildfire bomb effect\n    player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ bombSpellId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system managing explosive-based abilities.
    It assumes that the WildfireBombManager instance has been properly initialized
    with valid spell data. The returned spell ID should be validated against the server's
    spell database to ensure it exists and is correctly configured.
