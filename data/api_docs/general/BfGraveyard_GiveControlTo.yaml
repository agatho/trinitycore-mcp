  class: BfGraveyard
  method: GiveControlTo
  signature: void BfGraveyard::GiveControlTo(int team)
documentation:
  brief: Transfers control of the graveyard to the specified team.
  description: The GiveControlTo method is used in World of Warcraft's Battle for
    Azeroth content to transfer control of a graveyard from one faction to another.
    This method updates the internal state of the BfGraveyard object, changing which
    team currently controls the graveyard. The method typically triggers visual and
    functional changes in the game world, such as updating the graveyard's flag color
    or modifying the behavior of players interacting with it. It is commonly called
    during battlefield events or when capturing objectives in battlegrounds.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team ID to which control of the graveyard should be transferred.
      Valid values are typically 0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde, though specific implementations
      may vary based on the battleground context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Transfer Control to Horde
    code: 'BfGraveyard* graveyard = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldGraveyardById(123);

      graveyard->GiveControlTo(1); // Transfer control to Horde (team ID 1)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Transfer Control Based on Faction
    code: 'BfGraveyard* graveyard = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldGraveyardById(456);

      Player* player = ...; // Get a player reference

      uint32 teamId = player->GetTeamId();

      graveyard->GiveControlTo(teamId); // Transfer control to the player''s faction'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal event handlers or callbacks that update
    the UI, send packets to clients, and potentially modify the state of related objects
    such as flags or capture points. The implementation may also involve synchronization
    mechanisms to ensure consistency across all connected clients.
  warnings: Ensure that the team parameter is valid before calling this method, as
    invalid values could cause undefined behavior or client-side issues. This method
    should only be called in appropriate battleground contexts where graveyard control
    is meaningful.
