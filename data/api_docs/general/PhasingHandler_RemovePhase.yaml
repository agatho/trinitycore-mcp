  class: PhasingHandler
  method: RemovePhase
  signature: void PhasingHandler::RemovePhase(WorldObject * object, uint32 phaseId,
    bool updateVisibility)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified phase from a WorldObject's phasing state.
  description: The RemovePhase method removes a specific phase ID from a given WorldObject's
    active phasing state. This allows objects to be excluded from certain phase-based
    visibility or interaction contexts, such as during quest events, boss encounters,
    or area-specific gameplay mechanics. The method optionally updates the object's
    visibility state to reflect the phase removal immediately. Phase removal is typically
    used in conjunction with AddPhase to manage dynamic world states and ensure proper
    client-side visibility for players and creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject (player or creature) from which the phase
      will be removed. Must not be null.
  - name: phaseId
    description: The unique identifier of the phase to remove. This should correspond
      to a valid phase defined in the game's phase system.
  - name: updateVisibility
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to immediately update the object's
      visibility state. If true, the object's phasing state will be recalculated and
      visibility updated for nearby players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a phase from a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      PhasingHandler::RemovePhase(player, 12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove a phase without updating visibility
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      PhasingHandler::RemovePhase(creature, 67890, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the phasing system which is integral to World of
    Warcraft's visibility and interaction mechanics. The phase ID must be valid and
    previously added via AddPhase for this method to have meaningful effect. When
    updateVisibility is set to true, it triggers a full visibility recalculation which
    may impact performance if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling RemovePhase with an invalid or non-existent phaseId will not cause
    errors but will have no effect. Always ensure that the phase being removed was
    previously added using AddPhase. Avoid frequent calls to this method with updateVisibility=true
    as it can cause performance degradation due to visibility recalculations.
