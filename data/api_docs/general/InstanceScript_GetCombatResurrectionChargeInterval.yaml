  method: GetCombatResurrectionChargeInterval
  signature: uint32 InstanceScript::GetCombatResurrectionChargeInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interval in milliseconds between combat resurrection charges
    for players in the instance.
  description: This method returns the time interval, measured in milliseconds, that
    must pass between each combat resurrection charge granted to players within the
    instance. Combat resurrection charges are typically used in scenarios where players
    can be resurrected during combat without losing their items or experience. The
    value returned by this method is often used to control how frequently a player
    can be resurrected while engaged in combat, preventing abuse of the resurrection
    mechanic. This interval may vary based on the specific instance type and its configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time interval in milliseconds between combat
    resurrection charges. A value of 0 typically indicates that no combat resurrection
    charges are allowed or that the feature is disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Check Combat Resurrection Interval
    code: "uint32 interval = instanceScript->GetCombatResurrectionChargeInterval();\n\
      if (interval > 0)\n{\n    // Enable combat resurrection with the specified interval\n\
      \    player->SetCombatResurrectionChargeInterval(interval);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during instance initialization or when setting
    up player combat mechanics. The returned value should be used to enforce cooldowns
    on combat resurrection actions in the game logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the interval value is properly validated before applying it
    to prevent potential exploits or performance issues related to rapid resurrection
    cycles.
