  class: Item
  method: GetItemModifiedAppearance
  signature: const int * Item::GetItemModifiedAppearance() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the item's modified appearance ID, which determines its visual
    appearance in-game.
  description: The GetItemModifiedAppearance method returns a pointer to the modified
    appearance ID associated with an item. This ID controls how the item appears visually
    on the character, including cosmetic changes such as dye colors, enchantment effects,
    and other visual modifications. The method is typically used in conjunction with
    item display information to determine the actual visual representation of an item
    in the game world. It is important to note that this value may be null or zero
    if no modified appearance has been applied to the item.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer representing the modified appearance ID,
    which can be null or zero if no visual modification has been applied to the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 1);\nconst int* modifiedAppearance\
      \ = item->GetItemModifiedAppearance();\nif (modifiedAppearance != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the modified appearance ID for visual display\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the item's internal data structure and should be used
    carefully when dealing with visual modifications. Performance considerations arise
    when checking multiple items or using this method in loops during item processing.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return null values if no
    modified appearance has been applied, potentially leading to invalid memory access
    if not properly checked. Also, the returned pointer should be treated as read-only
    since modifying the value could affect game balance.
