  class: VendorInteraction
  method: CalculateVendorDistance
  signature: float VendorInteraction::CalculateVendorDistance(Player * player, uint32
    vendorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the Euclidean distance between a player and a vendor within the
    game world.
  description: The CalculateVendorDistance method computes the straight-line distance
    in game units between the current position of a Player object and a vendor specified
    by its GUID. This calculation is typically used for determining whether a player
    is within acceptable trading range of a vendor, which affects interactions such
    as item purchasing or vendor availability. The method utilizes the player's current
    location coordinates and the vendor's stored position to perform the distance
    computation using standard Euclidean geometry. It does not account for terrain
    obstacles or pathfinding; it simply returns the direct spatial distance between
    the two entities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose location is used as the starting
      point for distance calculation.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor entity in the game world.
      Must correspond to a valid GameObject or Creature with vendor functionality.
  returns: A float value representing the Euclidean distance between the player and
    the vendor in game units. Returns zero if either the player or vendor cannot be
    located, or if the vendor GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 vendorGuid\
      \ = 12345;\nfloat distance = VendorInteraction::CalculateVendorDistance(player,\
      \ vendorGuid);\nif (distance > 0 && distance <= 10.0f) {\n    // Player is within\
      \ 10 units of the vendor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Vendor Proximity Before Interaction
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 vendorGuid = session->GetPlayer()->GetSelection();\n\
      float distance = VendorInteraction::CalculateVendorDistance(player, vendorGuid);\n\
      if (distance > 0 && distance <= 5.0f) {\n    // Proceed with vendor interaction\
      \ logic\n} else {\n    // Notify player that they are too far away\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the vendor's position is already known and accessible
    via the GUID. If a vendor is not currently loaded or visible in the world, this
    function may return inaccurate results or zero. For performance-critical code
    paths, consider caching vendor positions rather than recalculating distances every
    frame.
  warnings: Do not use this method for pathfinding or movement validation; it only
    calculates straight-line distance and ignores obstacles like walls or terrain.
    Also, ensure that the vendorGuid corresponds to a valid vendor entity before calling
    this function, otherwise unexpected behavior may occur.
