documentation:
  brief: Loads and processes linked respawn data for game objects and creatures in
    the world.
  description: The LoadLinkedRespawn method initializes and loads all linked respawn
    associations from the database, ensuring that when a game object or creature is
    destroyed or despawned, its linked counterparts are properly respawned according
    to configured rules. This functionality supports complex respawn behaviors such
    as multiple related spawns, chained respawns, and conditional respawns based on
    world state or player activity. The method typically runs during server startup
    or database reload operations to ensure all linked respawn relationships are correctly
    established in memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadLinkedRespawn();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reloads.
    It reads from the 'linked_respawn' table in the database and builds internal lookup
    structures for fast access during runtime. The method assumes that the database
    connection is already established and that the linked_respawn table contains valid
    data.
  warnings: Improperly configured linked respawn entries in the database can cause
    infinite loops or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all linked respawn relationships
    are properly validated to avoid circular dependencies or orphaned entries.
