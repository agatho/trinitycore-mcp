  signature: uint32 SpellInfo::GetMaxTicks() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum tick count for a spell's periodic effect.
  description: The GetMaxTicks method retrieves the maximum number of ticks that a
    periodic spell effect can apply. This value represents how many times a spell
    will trigger its periodic effect before it expires, typically used in conjunction
    with spell effects like periodic damage or periodic healing. The method is commonly
    used in spell handling and game mechanics to determine the duration and frequency
    of periodic effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the maximum tick count for the spell's periodic effect, which indicates
    how many times the spell will apply its periodic effect before expiration. This
    value is typically derived from the spell's data and may be zero if the spell
    has no periodic effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 maxTicks = spellInfo->GetMaxTicks();\nif (maxTicks > 0)\n{\n   \
      \ // Process periodic spell ticks\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine the total duration of a spell's periodic effect. It may be affected
    by various factors including spell modifiers, talent effects, and game mechanics.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return zero for
    spells that do not have periodic effects, which could lead to incorrect assumptions
    about the spell's behavior.
