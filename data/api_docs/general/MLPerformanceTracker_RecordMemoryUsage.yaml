  method: RecordMemoryUsage
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::RecordMemoryUsage(uint32_t botGuid, MLOperationType
    operation, uint64_t bytes)
documentation:
  brief: Records memory usage for a specific bot operation
  description: The RecordMemoryUsage method logs memory consumption data associated
    with a particular bot operation. It tracks how much memory is used during various
    machine learning operations performed by a bot identified by its GUID. This functionality
    is crucial for performance monitoring and optimization within the TrinityCore
    framework's AI subsystem. The method stores this information for later analysis
    and reporting, helping developers understand resource utilization patterns across
    different bot activities.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier of the bot performing the operation. This GUID
      corresponds to a specific AI entity in the game world.
  - name: operation
    description: Type of machine learning operation being performed. This enum value
      indicates what kind of ML activity is consuming memory.
  - name: bytes
    description: Amount of memory consumed during the operation, measured in bytes.
      This value represents the peak or total memory usage for the given operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Usage Recording
    code: MLPerformanceTracker::Instance()->RecordMemoryUsage(12345, MLOperationType::TRAINING,
      1024000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Memory Usage for Inference Operation
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      tracker.RecordMemoryUsage(botGuid, MLOperationType::INFERENCE, memoryUsed);

      // Logs memory usage for a bot''s inference operation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI subsystem during bot
    execution. The memory tracking data may be aggregated and reported through performance
    metrics or debugging tools. Ensure that botGuid values are valid and correspond
    to existing AI entities in the world.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid botGuid values may result in undefined
    behavior or data corruption. The operation parameter must be a valid MLOperationType
    enum value; otherwise, the tracking may fail silently or produce incorrect results.
