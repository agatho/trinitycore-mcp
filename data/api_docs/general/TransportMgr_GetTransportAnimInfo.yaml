documentation:
  brief: Retrieves transport animation information for a specified transport entry
    ID.
  description: The GetTransportAnimInfo method fetches the TransportAnimation structure
    associated with a given transport entry identifier. This function is used internally
    by the TrinityCore server to manage and retrieve animation data for various transport
    objects such as boats, zeppelins, and other moving platforms within the game world.
    The returned pointer provides access to animation-related properties including
    movement patterns, speed, and timing information necessary for rendering and updating
    transport entities in real-time. This method performs a lookup in an internal
    cache or database of transport animations and returns a const pointer to avoid
    modification of the animation data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a TransportAnimation object if the entry ID is valid
    and found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no animation data exists for the specified
    entry.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve transport animation data
    code: "const TransportAnimation* animInfo = sTransportMgr->GetTransportAnimInfo(12345);\n\
      if (animInfo != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use animInfo to access transport animation\
      \ properties\n    printf(\"Transport speed: %f\\n\", animInfo->speed);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from a cached data structure.
    The TransportAnimation objects are typically loaded at server startup and remain
    constant during runtime, making this lookup operation efficient.
  warnings: Ensure that the entry ID passed to this function corresponds to an actual
    transport in the game database; otherwise, the returned pointer will be null and
    accessing it without checking may cause a crash.
