  method: ManageQuestLog
  signature: void QuestManager::ManageQuestLog()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the player's quest log by updating, adding, or removing quests based
    on current progress and game state.
  description: The ManageQuestLog method is responsible for maintaining the integrity
    of a player's quest log within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates the current
    state of active quests, checks for completion conditions, updates quest status
    flags, and ensures that the player's quest log accurately reflects their progress
    in the game world. This method typically runs during periodic updates or when
    specific quest events occur, such as killing monsters, collecting items, or interacting
    with NPCs. The function handles both automatic quest progression and manual quest
    management, ensuring that players receive appropriate rewards and quest advancements
    based on their actions.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Update Loop
    code: "void Player::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    _questManager.ManageQuestLog();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the player's periodic update cycle
    and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required for quest state
    synchronization. It relies on internal quest data structures and may perform database
    operations to persist quest progress.
  warnings: Invoking this method outside of its intended update context can lead to
    inconsistent quest states or unexpected behavior. The method modifies internal
    quest tracking data, so it should only be called when the player's state is stable
    and consistent.
