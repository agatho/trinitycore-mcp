  signature: void NearestHostileUnitCheck::NearestHostileUnitCheck(const NearestHostileUnitCheck
    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a NearestHostileUnitCheck object with another instance's parameters.
  description: The NearestHostileUnitCheck constructor initializes a new instance
    of the class by copying the state and configuration from an existing NearestHostileUnitCheck
    object. This is a copy constructor used in AI behavior systems within TrinityCore
    to duplicate the check logic for hostile unit detection. The method ensures that
    all internal parameters related to hostile unit targeting are properly copied,
    allowing for consistent behavior when evaluating nearby hostile units in combat
    scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source NearestHostileUnitCheck object whose state and configuration
      will be copied to initialize this new instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copy Constructing a Hostile Unit Check
    code: 'NearestHostileUnitCheck originalCheck;

      // Configure originalCheck...

      NearestHostileUnitCheck newCheck(originalCheck); // Copy constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard copy constructor implementation. It's typically used in
    AI systems where behavior patterns need to be duplicated across different instances
    or contexts, such as when creating multiple AI agents that should behave identically
    regarding hostile unit detection.
