documentation:
  brief: Initializes the resource monitoring system to track and manage server resource
    usage.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the ResourceMonitor class to begin tracking
    various system resources such as memory, CPU usage, and network activity. It performs
    necessary setup operations including allocating internal data structures, registering
    monitoring callbacks, and starting background threads for continuous resource
    sampling. This method must be called before any other resource monitoring functionality
    can be used. The initialization process is designed to be idempotent, meaning
    it can safely be called multiple times without adverse effects, though subsequent
    calls after successful initialization will typically return false. Proper initialization
    ensures that the server's performance metrics are accurately captured for administrative
    and debugging purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the resource monitor was successfully initialized or if
    it was already initialized previously. Returns false if the initialization failed
    due to system constraints, insufficient permissions, or other critical errors
    during setup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "ResourceMonitor* monitor = new ResourceMonitor();\nif (monitor->Initialize())\
      \ {\n    // Monitoring is now active\n    printf(\"Resource monitoring initialized\
      \ successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to initialize resource monitoring\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Error Handling
    code: "ResourceMonitor monitor;\nbool success = monitor.Initialize();\nif (!success)\
      \ {\n    // Log error and potentially shut down server\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to initialize ResourceMonitor\");\n    // Optionally exit or continue\
      \ with reduced functionality\n} else {\n    sLog->outInfo(\"ResourceMonitor\
      \ initialized successfully\");\n    // Proceed with normal operation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Initialize method may perform system calls that require elevated privileges
    on some platforms. It is recommended to call this method early in the server startup
    process, ideally before any major resource-intensive operations begin. The monitoring
    system typically starts collecting data asynchronously and may take a few moments
    to stabilize after initialization.
  warnings: Calling Initialize() after the monitor has already been initialized will
    not cause errors but will return false. Avoid calling this method from multiple
    threads simultaneously as it might lead to race conditions during setup. If initialization
    fails, some monitoring features may be unavailable until a successful re-initialization
    occurs.
