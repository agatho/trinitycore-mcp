  class: LFGRoleDetector
  method: DetectRoleFromGear
  signature: uint8 LFGRoleDetector::DetectRoleFromGear(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes a player's equipped gear to determine their most likely role in
    a Looking for Group (LFG) context.
  description: The DetectRoleFromGear method evaluates the items currently equipped
    by a player, including weapons, armor, and accessories, to infer their primary
    role within the game's LFG system. This function considers item statistics such
    as attack power, spell power, defense ratings, and other relevant attributes that
    are typically associated with specific roles like Tank, Healer, or Damage Dealer
    (DPS). The method is used primarily for matching players to appropriate groups
    based on their gear composition rather than their class or specialization alone.
    It does not account for enchantments, gems, or other temporary stat modifiers
    beyond base item stats.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the detected role. Possible values are
    typically defined as constants such as LFG_ROLE_TANK (1), LFG_ROLE_HEALER (2),
    LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE (4), or LFG_ROLE_NONE (0) depending on how the TrinityCore implementation
    defines these roles internally.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in LFG Context
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is valid\nuint8 role = LFGRoleDetector::DetectRoleFromGear(player);\n\
      switch (role)\n{\n    case LFG_ROLE_TANK:\n        // Handle tank detection\
      \ logic\n        break;\n    case LFG_ROLE_HEALER:\n        // Handle healer\
      \ detection logic\n        break;\n    case LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE:\n        // Handle\
      \ DPS detection logic\n        break;\n    default:\n        // No role detected\
      \ or unknown role\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the base item stats and does not consider temporary
    buffs, consumables, or gear upgrades that may change a player's effective role.
    It is intended to be used during LFG matchmaking processes where quick role assignment
    based on current gear is needed.
  warnings: The detection logic may misidentify players with hybrid gear setups (e.g.,
    a tank wearing DPS gear) as being in the wrong role if their gear does not clearly
    indicate their primary function. Additionally, this method should only be called
    when the player's gear state is stable and fully updated to avoid incorrect role
    assignments.
