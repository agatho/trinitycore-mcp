  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleModAttackSpeed(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the attack speed of a unit affected by an aura.
  description: The HandleModAttackSpeed method is responsible for adjusting the attack
    speed of a unit when an aura effect that modifies attack speed is applied or removed.
    This method is typically invoked during aura application or removal events, and
    it directly affects how frequently a unit can perform attacks. The modification
    is calculated based on the aura's properties and the mode of operation (apply
    or remove). It ensures that attack speed changes are properly synchronized with
    the game's combat system and that units maintain consistent behavior during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This contains information about the aura, including its
      properties and the target unit.
  - name: mode
    description: An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the mode of operation. Typically
      used to distinguish between application (1) and removal (0) of the aura effect.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura effect is being applied
      (true) or removed (false). This determines the direction of the attack speed
      modification.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying an Attack Speed Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* auraEffect = ...; // Assume aura effect is initialized

      AuraApplication* aurApp = ...; // Assume aura application is initialized

      auraEffect->HandleModAttackSpeed(aurApp, 1, true); // Apply attack speed modification'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing an Attack Speed Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* auraEffect = ...; // Assume aura effect is initialized

      AuraApplication* aurApp = ...; // Assume aura application is initialized

      auraEffect->HandleModAttackSpeed(aurApp, 0, false); // Remove attack speed modification'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts with the unit's combat system and may affect performance
    if called frequently during combat. It should only be invoked from within aura
    application or removal logic to maintain consistency.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect attack speed calculations,
    potentially causing game balance issues or unexpected behavior in combat mechanics.
