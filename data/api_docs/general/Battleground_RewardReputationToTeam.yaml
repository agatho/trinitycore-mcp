    int team)
documentation:
  brief: Rewards reputation to all players on the specified team within the battleground.
  description: The RewardReputationToTeam method distributes a specified amount of
    reputation to all players belonging to a given team within the battleground. This
    method is typically used during battleground end events to reward players for
    their participation and performance. The faction_id parameter determines which
    faction's reputation is being awarded, while the team parameter specifies whether
    to award to the Alliance (0) or Horde (1) team. Players must be currently participating
    in the battleground for the reputation to be awarded.
  parameters:
  - name: faction_id
    description: The ID of the faction whose reputation will be awarded. This corresponds
      to faction IDs defined in the game's database.
  - name: Reputation
    description: The amount of reputation points to award to each player on the specified
      team.
  - name: team
    description: The team to reward reputation to. 0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Award Reputation to Winning Team
    code: "void BG::OnTeamVictory(int winning_team)\n{\n    // Award 100 reputation\
      \ to the winning team\n    RewardReputationToTeam(729, 100, winning_team);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Award Reputation Based on Player Performance
    code: "void BG::RewardPlayersForKills()\n{\n    // Award 50 reputation to both\
      \ teams for kills\n    RewardReputationToTeam(729, 50, TEAM_ALLIANCE);\n   \
      \ RewardReputationToTeam(729, 50, TEAM_HORDE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects players who are currently in the battleground and
    have not left. Reputation is awarded immediately to players' faction standings.
    The method does not check if the faction_id exists or if the reputation amount
    is valid - it simply distributes the specified amount.
  warnings: Ensure that faction_id corresponds to a valid faction in the game database,
    as invalid faction IDs may cause undefined behavior. The team parameter should
    only be 0 (Alliance) or 1 (Horde), otherwise unexpected results may occur.
