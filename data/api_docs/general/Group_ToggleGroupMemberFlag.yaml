  method: ToggleGroupMemberFlag
  signature: void Group::ToggleGroupMemberFlag(member_witerator slot, int flag, bool
    apply)
documentation:
  brief: Toggles a specified flag for a group member at the given iterator position.
  description: The ToggleGroupMemberFlag method is used to enable or disable a specific
    flag for a group member identified by the provided iterator. This method modifies
    the internal state of the group member's flags, which can affect various group-related
    behaviors such as loot settings, leadership status, or role assignments. The operation
    is performed in-place and does not trigger any additional group updates or notifications
    directly; it simply modifies the flag value. This functionality is typically used
    internally by the TrinityCore framework to manage group member states during group
    operations like promotions, loot distribution changes, or role assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: An iterator pointing to the group member whose flag will be toggled.
      This should be a valid member_witerator obtained from methods like GetMemberSlots()
      or similar group iteration functions.
  - name: flag
    description: The integer flag value to toggle. This represents a specific bit
      flag used internally by the group system to track various member states (e.g.,
      leader, assistant, loot master). Valid values depend on the defined group flags
      within TrinityCore's codebase.
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false) the
      specified flag. When true, the flag is set; when false, it is cleared.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Toggle Loot Master Flag for a Group Member
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    auto memberSlot\
      \ = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n    if (memberSlot != group->GetMemberSlots().end())\n\
      \    {\n        group->ToggleGroupMemberFlag(memberSlot, GROUP_MEMBER_FLAG_LOOT_MASTER,\
      \ true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Assistant Flag from a Group Member
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    auto memberSlot\
      \ = group->GetMemberSlots().find(playerGuid);\n    if (memberSlot != group->GetMemberSlots().end())\n\
      \    {\n        group->ToggleGroupMemberFlag(memberSlot, GROUP_MEMBER_FLAG_ASSISTANT,\
      \ false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates internal flag bits without broadcasting
    changes to other players. It's recommended to use this method carefully and only
    when you understand the implications of modifying group member flags. The method
    assumes that the provided slot is valid and points to an existing group member.
  warnings: Using invalid iterators or incorrect flag values may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate that the slot iterator is valid before calling
    this method. Be cautious with flag combinations, as some flags might conflict
    or have unintended side effects when applied together.
