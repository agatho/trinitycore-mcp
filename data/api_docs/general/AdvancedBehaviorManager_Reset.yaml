  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: Reset
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the advanced behavior manager to its initial state, clearing all active
    behaviors and restoring default settings.
  description: The Reset method clears all currently active behaviors and resets the
    AdvancedBehaviorManager to its default configuration. This method is typically
    invoked when a creature or NPC needs to be reinitialized after a behavior change
    or during cleanup operations. It ensures that no residual behavior states persist,
    allowing for clean reinitialization of AI logic. The reset operation does not
    affect the underlying creature data or configuration; it only resets the runtime
    behavior state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: "void OnCreatureReset()\n{\n    m_behaviorManager->Reset();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset During Behavior Transition
    code: "void ChangeBehavior(BehaviorType newBehavior)\n{\n    m_behaviorManager->Reset();\n\
      \    // Apply new behavior after reset\n    m_behaviorManager->SetBehavior(newBehavior);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully during AI state transitions to avoid
    unexpected behavior. It is recommended to call Reset before applying new behaviors
    to ensure clean state management.
  warnings: Calling Reset while a behavior is actively executing may cause undefined
    behavior or incomplete cleanup of active tasks. Always ensure that the behavior
    manager is in a stable state before invoking this method.
