  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: SpawnBots
  signature: uint32 BotSpawnOrchestrator::SpawnBots(const int & requests)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a specified number of bots into the game world and returns the count
    of successfully spawned bots.
  description: The SpawnBots method is responsible for creating and initializing a
    given number of bot characters within the World of Warcraft environment managed
    by TrinityCore. This method typically handles the allocation of necessary resources,
    assignment of unique identifiers, and integration of new bot instances into the
    active world state. It may involve checking available spawn points, validating
    bot configurations, and ensuring that the total number of bots does not exceed
    system limits or game-defined constraints. The method is commonly used in automated
    testing scenarios, bot management systems, or when dynamically adjusting the number
    of non-player characters in a server environment.
  parameters:
  - name: requests
    description: An integer value specifying how many bots should be spawned. A positive
      value indicates the desired number of new bots to create, while a zero or negative
      value typically results in no action being taken.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the actual number of bots that were successfully
    spawned. This value may be less than the requested count if spawning fails due
    to resource limitations, invalid configurations, or other system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Spawn 5 Bots
    code: 'uint32 spawned = orchestrator.SpawnBots(5);

      // Returns the number of bots successfully created (e.g., 5 if all succeeded)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Spawn Bots with Error Handling
    code: "int requestCount = 10;\nuint32 actualSpawned = orchestrator.SpawnBots(requestCount);\n\
      if (actualSpawned < static_cast<uint32>(requestCount)) {\n    // Log warning\
      \ or handle partial spawn\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Only %u out of %d\
      \ bots were spawned.\", actualSpawned, requestCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal bot management systems and may
    perform operations such as memory allocation for new bot objects, initialization
    of AI behavior scripts, and registration within the game world's object manager.
    It is recommended to call this method during appropriate server update cycles
    or when system resources are not under heavy load to avoid performance degradation.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very large value for 'requests' may lead to
    resource exhaustion or server instability. Ensure that bot spawning is throttled
    appropriately in production environments. Also, be aware that the actual number
    of bots spawned might differ from the requested amount due to internal validation
    checks or system limitations.
