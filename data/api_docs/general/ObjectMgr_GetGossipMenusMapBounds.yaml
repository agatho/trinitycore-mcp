  brief: Retrieves the bounds of gossip menus associated with a specific menu ID.
  description: The GetGossipMenusMapBounds method retrieves the map bounds for a specified
    gossip menu ID. This function is used internally by the TrinityCore server to
    manage and query gossip menu data, particularly in relation to how these menus
    are mapped across different zones or maps within the game world. It allows developers
    to determine the geographical scope of a particular gossip menu, which can be
    useful for implementing dynamic quest systems, zone-specific dialogues, or map-based
    interactions. The method does not require any parameters and returns a GossipMenusMapBounds
    structure that contains information about the bounding area of the menu's associated
    map regions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GossipMenusMapBounds object containing the geographical bounds (min/max
    coordinates) for the specified gossip menu ID. This structure typically includes
    data such as minimum and maximum X/Y coordinates, map ID, and possibly other spatial
    metadata related to where the gossip menu is valid or active in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Gossip Menu Bounds
    code: "GossipMenusMapBounds bounds = sObjectMgr->GetGossipMenusMapBounds(12345);\n\
      if (bounds.IsValid())\n{\n    printf(\"Menu bounds: X[%f, %f], Y[%f, %f]\\n\"\
      , \n           bounds.GetMinX(), bounds.GetMaxX(), \n           bounds.GetMinY(),\
      \ bounds.GetMaxY());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other gossip menu management
    functions within the ObjectMgr class. The returned GossipMenusMapBounds object
    should be checked for validity before accessing its members to avoid potential
    runtime errors. Performance-wise, this function likely operates on pre-indexed
    data structures for fast lookup.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided menu ID actually exists in the gossip menus database;
    otherwise, the returned bounds may be invalid or undefined. Accessing members
    of an invalid GossipMenusMapBounds object can lead to undefined behavior.
