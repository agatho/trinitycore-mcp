  method: ~BossAI
  signature: void BossAI::~BossAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BossAI instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The BossAI destructor is automatically invoked when a BossAI object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of resources allocated during the boss encounter, including releasing any held
    references, cleaning up AI state, and performing any necessary deinitialization
    tasks. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this destructor
    plays a critical role in preventing memory leaks and maintaining stable server
    performance during boss fights. The destruction process typically involves calling
    base class destructors and ensuring that all associated creature data is properly
    released.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BossAI* boss = new BossAI(creature);\n    //\
      \ ... boss AI logic ...\n    delete boss; // Triggers ~BossAI destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocation
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    BossAI bossAI(creature);\n    // ~BossAI\
      \ called automatically when bossAI goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is virtual in the base class, ensuring proper polymorphic
    destruction. It's important to note that this method should not be called directly
    unless explicitly managing object lifetime. The implementation typically handles
    cleanup of AI-related resources and ensures no dangling references remain after
    destruction.
  warnings: Never manually invoke the destructor unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. Calling it multiple times or on already-destroyed objects will
    lead to undefined behavior. Also, ensure that all derived classes properly implement
    their own destructors if they have specific cleanup requirements.
