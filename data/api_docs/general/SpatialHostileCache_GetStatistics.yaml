  class: SpatialHostileCache
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: CacheStats SpatialHostileCache::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves cache statistics for the spatial hostile cache instance.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a CacheStats object containing detailed
    metrics about the current state of the SpatialHostileCache. This includes information
    such as the number of entries cached, memory usage, hit/miss ratios, and other
    performance-related data. The returned statistics are useful for monitoring and
    optimizing the behavior of hostile unit tracking within spatial regions. This
    method is typically used for debugging, performance analysis, or administrative
    purposes to understand how the cache is performing under various conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CacheStats object containing key metrics about the cache's current state
    including entry count, memory usage, and access statistics. The structure of this
    object is defined by the CacheStats class and may include fields such as total_entries,
    hit_count, miss_count, and memory_consumption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Cache Statistics
    code: 'SpatialHostileCache cache;

      CacheStats stats = cache.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total entries: " << stats.total_entries << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Hit ratio: " << stats.hit_count / (stats.hit_count + stats.miss_count)
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is non-blocking and safe to call from any thread. The returned
    CacheStats object is a snapshot of the cache state at the time of the call, so
    values may change immediately after the method returns. Performance monitoring
    tools often use this method to track cache efficiency over time.
