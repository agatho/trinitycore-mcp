  signature: void LFGMgr::_SaveToDB(int guid, uint32 db_guid)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the LFG (Looking for Group) data for a specific player to the database.
  description: The _SaveToDB method is responsible for persisting Looking for Group
    (LFG) data associated with a given player into the database. This method ensures
    that player's LFG preferences, queued groups, and related information are stored
    for future sessions. It typically gets invoked when a player leaves a group or
    when LFG data needs to be synchronized with the persistent storage. The method
    uses the provided GUID to identify which player's data should be saved. This is
    an internal method used by the LFG system and is not directly called from external
    code.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG data
      needs to be saved.
  - name: db_guid
    description: The database GUID used for identifying the player record in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Saving LFG Data for a Player
    code: "void SavePlayerLFGData(uint32 playerGuid, uint32 dbGuid)\n{\n    sLFGMgr->_SaveToDB(playerGuid,\
      \ dbGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG manager implementation and should
    only be called when necessary to persist LFG state. It is likely invoked automatically
    during player logout or group changes.
  warnings: Direct usage of this method outside of the LFG system's internal logic
    may lead to inconsistent data states. Ensure proper synchronization if used in
    multi-threaded contexts.
