  method: GetRangeForChatType
  signature: float CreatureTextMgr::GetRangeForChatType(int msgType)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum interaction range for a specified chat type used by creatures.
  description: The GetRangeForChatType method retrieves the default interaction range
    associated with a specific creature text message type. This range determines how
    far a player must be from a creature to receive or respond to that particular
    type of chat message. The method is typically used in conjunction with creature
    text systems to ensure proper communication distance behavior based on message
    type, such as whispering, yelling, or emotes. It supports various chat types defined
    by the game's internal messaging system and ensures appropriate spatial boundaries
    for creature communication.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum interaction range (in yards) for
    the specified chat type. Returns 0.0 if the message type is invalid or not configured.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve range for a whisper chat type
    code: "float range = sCreatureTextMgr->GetRangeForChatType(CHAT_TYPE_WHISPER);\n\
      if (range > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the range to determine if player is within\
      \ hearing distance\n    // Example: Check if player is within whisper range\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal configuration data for chat type ranges and
    may vary depending on server settings or custom modifications. The returned value
    represents a fixed range per message type rather than dynamic distance calculations.
