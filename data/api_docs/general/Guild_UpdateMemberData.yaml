documentation:
  brief: Updates a specific data field for a guild member.
  description: The UpdateMemberData method is used to modify a particular data field
    associated with a player's guild membership. This method allows the guild system
    to track and update various attributes of guild members, such as their rank, contribution
    statistics, or other relevant in-game data. It is typically invoked when changes
    occur within the guild context that need to be persisted or reflected in the member's
    record. The method operates on a specific data identifier and updates it with
    the provided value for the given player.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose guild member data is being updated.
      Must not be null.
  - name: dataid
    description: Identifier specifying which data field to update. Values are typically
      defined by the game's internal guild data system and may represent rank, contribution
      points, or other member-specific statistics.
  - name: value
    description: The new value to assign to the specified data field. The interpretation
      of this value depends on the dataid parameter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a guild member's contribution points
    code: "Player* player = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayerByName(\"JohnDoe\");\nif (player\
      \ && player->GetGuild()) {\n    player->GetGuild()->UpdateMemberData(player,\
      \ GUILD_DATA_CONTRIBUTION_POINTS, 1500);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Change a guild member's rank
    code: "Player* player = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayerByName(\"JaneSmith\");\nif\
      \ (player && player->GetGuild()) {\n    player->GetGuild()->UpdateMemberData(player,\
      \ GUILD_DATA_RANK, 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal updates to the guild member's data in
    the database or memory cache. It should be used carefully to avoid inconsistent
    state if not properly synchronized with other guild operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and that the guild membership
    is confirmed before calling this method. Passing invalid dataid values may lead
    to undefined behavior or data corruption.
