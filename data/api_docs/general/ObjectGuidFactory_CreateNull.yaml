documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a null ObjectGuid instance with all bits set to zero
  description: The CreateNull method generates a special ObjectGuid value that represents
    a null or invalid object reference. This GUID has all bits set to zero and is
    commonly used to indicate the absence of a valid object identifier in TrinityCore's
    object management system. The returned ObjectGuid can be used for comparisons,
    initialization of variables, or as a placeholder where no valid object ID exists.
    In World of Warcraft context, this is often used when dealing with uninitialized
    objects, deleted entities, or scenarios where an object reference is expected
    but not yet assigned.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ObjectGuid instance representing a null/invalid object identifier with
    all bits set to zero
  examples:
  - title: Creating a null GUID for initialization
    code: "ObjectGuid nullGuid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateNull();\nif (nullGuid.IsEmpty())\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where no valid GUID exists\n    printf(\"No valid object\
      \ reference available\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using null GUID in object management
    code: "class GameObject {\nprivate:\n    ObjectGuid m_guid;\npublic:\n    GameObject()\
      \ : m_guid(ObjectGuidFactory::CreateNull()) {}\n    \n    bool IsValid() const\
      \ {\n        return !m_guid.IsEmpty();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The null ObjectGuid created by this method is distinct from the 'invalid'
    state of a GUID. It's specifically designed for use as an uninitialized placeholder
    value in TrinityCore's object system. This method is thread-safe and does not
    perform any dynamic allocation or complex operations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned null GUID in contexts where actual
    object references are required. Always validate that a GUID is not null before
    attempting to access objects through it, as dereferencing a null GUID may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes.
