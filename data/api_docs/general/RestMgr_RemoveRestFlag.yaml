documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified rest flag from the player's current state.
  description: The RemoveRestFlag method is used to clear a specific rest flag from
    a player character's state within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    manages the player's resting status, which affects various game mechanics such
    as experience gain, resource regeneration, and quest progression. The method operates
    on a RestFlag enumeration value that represents different types of rest states
    (e.g., sitting, sleeping, resting in a city). When called, it updates the internal
    state of the player object to remove the specified flag, potentially affecting
    gameplay behavior and UI elements related to the player's rest status.
  parameters:
  - name: restFlag
    description: The RestFlag enumeration value representing the specific rest state
      to be removed from the player. Valid values typically include flags such as
      REST_FLAG_SIT, REST_FLAG_SLEEP, or REST_FLAG_CITY_REST, depending on the implementation
      and game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Sitting Flag
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      RestFlag flag = REST_FLAG_SIT;

      player->GetRestMgr()->RemoveRestFlag(flag);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove All Rest Flags
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      player->GetRestMgr()->RemoveRestFlag(REST_FLAG_SIT);

      player->GetRestMgr()->RemoveRestFlag(REST_FLAG_SLEEP);

      player->GetRestMgr()->RemoveRestFlag(REST_FLAG_CITY_REST);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player's
    rest state changes or when they perform actions that should clear their current
    rest flag. The implementation may also trigger updates to the player's UI, send
    packets to clients, and update internal game state variables. It's important to
    note that removing a rest flag does not necessarily mean the player is no longer
    resting; it simply removes the specific flag from their state.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the rest flag value may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect game state. Ensure that the RestFlag
    parameter corresponds to valid flags defined in the game's rest system, as invalid
    values could corrupt player data or cause unexpected gameplay issues.
