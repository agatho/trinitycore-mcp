  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float RogueCombatPositioning::GetOptimalRange(RogueSpec spec) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal combat range for a rogue based on their
    specialization.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    rogue should engage enemies in combat, tailored specifically to their chosen specialization.
    This value is crucial for AI decision-making and pathfinding logic within the
    TrinityCore framework. The method takes into account the unique mechanics and
    abilities associated with each rogue spec, such as stealth capabilities, weapon
    types, and tactical playstyles. It returns a float value representing the distance
    in yards. This method is typically used by AI systems to determine when to close
    or maintain distance from targets during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal combat range in yards for the specified
    rogue specialization. The value typically ranges between 5 and 30 yards depending
    on the spec, with stealth-based specs generally having shorter optimal ranges
    and burst damage specs having longer ranges.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine optimal range
    code: 'RogueCombatPositioning positioning;

      RogueSpec spec = RogueSpec::Assassination;

      float optimalRange = positioning.GetOptimalRange(spec);

      // Returns the optimal combat distance for Assassination rogue

      std::cout << "Optimal range: " << optimalRange << " yards" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using optimal range in AI decision logic
    code: "RogueCombatPositioning positioning;\nfloat currentDistance = unit->GetDistance(target);\n\
      float optimalRange = positioning.GetOptimalRange(player->GetRogueSpec());\n\n\
      if (currentDistance > optimalRange)\n{\n    // Move closer to target\n    player->MoveTowards(target,\
      \ optimalRange);\n}\nelse if (currentDistance < optimalRange * 0.8f)\n{\n  \
      \  // Move away from target\n    player->MoveAwayFrom(target, optimalRange);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or computed once per spec to improve performance
    in combat AI logic. The exact values returned may vary based on game updates and
    balance changes in TrinityCore. The implementation probably considers factors
    like weapon reach, ability ranges, and stealth mechanics specific to each rogue
    specialization.
  warnings: The method assumes a valid rogue specialization is set; calling it with
    an invalid or uninitialized spec could lead to unexpected behavior. This method
    should not be called during combat state transitions as the result may not reflect
    current tactical conditions.
