  brief: Updates the regeneration state of all runes for the player
  description: This method handles the internal logic for updating the regeneration
    status of all runes belonging to the player. It is typically invoked during player
    updates or when rune states need to be refreshed, ensuring that runes are properly
    managed according to game mechanics such as cooldowns and resource availability.
    The method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations,
    instead modifying internal player state related to rune management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core game loop or during
    specific player state transitions. It may be invoked automatically when runes
    are consumed or when a player's state changes in ways that affect rune availability.
