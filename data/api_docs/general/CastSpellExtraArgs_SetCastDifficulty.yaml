  method: SetCastDifficulty
  signature: CastSpellExtraArgs & CastSpellExtraArgs::SetCastDifficulty(Difficulty
    castDifficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the difficulty level for a spell cast operation within the CastSpellExtraArgs
    structure.
  description: The SetCastDifficulty method configures the difficulty setting that
    will be applied when executing a spell through the CastSpellExtraArgs structure.
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore to determine how spells
    behave based on instance difficulty levels such as normal, heroic, or mythic modes.
    The method accepts a Difficulty enum value and updates the internal state of the
    CastSpellExtraArgs object. It returns a reference to the same object to allow
    for method chaining. This functionality is essential for proper spell handling
    in dungeon and raid environments where spell effects may vary depending on the
    difficulty level selected by the player or game system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to the CastSpellExtraArgs object, enabling method chaining
    for fluent API usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CastSpellExtraArgs args;

      args.SetCastDifficulty(DIFFICULTY_NORMAL);

      // Spell will now be cast with normal difficulty settings'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining Example
    code: "CastSpellExtraArgs args;\nargs.SetCastDifficulty(DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\n \
      \   .SetTriggeredByAura(12345)\n    .SetCastTime(1000);\n// All settings applied\
      \ in sequence"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell casting systems where
    difficulty affects damage, healing, or other spell properties. The Difficulty
    enum values are defined within the TrinityCore codebase and correspond to standard
    WoW difficulty levels. This method does not validate the input parameter, so developers
    should ensure that only valid Difficulty values are passed.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in incorrect spell behavior during
    encounters with different difficulty settings. Ensure that the provided Difficulty
    value is appropriate for the current game context (e.g., dungeon, raid, or world
    encounter).
