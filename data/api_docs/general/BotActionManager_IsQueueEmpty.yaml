documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot action queue is empty
  description: The IsQueueEmpty method determines if there are any pending actions
    queued for execution within the BotActionManager. This method is typically used
    to evaluate whether the bot has work to perform or if it should wait for new actions
    to be added to the queue. The check is performed in a thread-safe manner and does
    not modify the state of the queue. It's commonly used in bot AI loops to decide
    when to process queued actions or when to idle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the action queue contains no pending actions, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Queue Check
    code: "if (botActionManager.IsQueueEmpty()) {\n    // Bot has no queued actions,\
      \ perform idle behavior\n    bot->DoIdleBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Action Processing
    code: "while (!botActionManager.IsQueueEmpty()) {\n    auto action = botActionManager.PopNextAction();\n\
      \    if (action) {\n        action->Execute();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple check on the internal queue size without locking,
    assuming that the underlying queue implementation is thread-safe or that access
    is properly synchronized by the caller. The method is lightweight and suitable
    for frequent checks in AI decision loops.
