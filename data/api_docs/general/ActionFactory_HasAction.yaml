documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific action exists within the ActionFactory's collection
  description: The HasAction method determines whether a particular action, identified
    by its name, is registered or available within the ActionFactory. This method
    is commonly used in AI and behavior tree implementations to validate that an action
    can be executed before attempting to invoke it. It performs a lookup operation
    against the internal collection of actions and returns true if the specified action
    exists, false otherwise. The method is typically called during initialization
    or execution phases to ensure action safety and prevent runtime errors due to
    missing actions.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The string identifier of the action to check for existence. This
      should match the exact name used when registering the action with the ActionFactory.
  returns: Returns true if an action with the specified name exists in the factory,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (actionFactory.HasAction(\"MoveToTarget\")) {\n    // Proceed with executing\
      \ the action\n    actionFactory.GetAction(\"MoveToTarget\")->Execute();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation Before Execution
    code: "std::string actionName = \"AttackTarget\";\nif (actionFactory.HasAction(actionName))\
      \ {\n    auto action = actionFactory.GetAction(actionName);\n    if (action)\
      \ {\n        action->Execute();\n    }\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Action\
      \ '%s' not found in factory\", actionName.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the internal action registry,
    so performance may degrade with a large number of registered actions. It is recommended
    to cache results or use a hash map for frequent lookups in high-performance scenarios.
