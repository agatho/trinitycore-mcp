  method: ~BotAccountMgr
  signature: void BotAccountMgr::~BotAccountMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotAccountMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotAccountMgr class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any internal data structures, closing connections if applicable, and
    ensuring no memory leaks occur when the manager is destroyed. In the context of
    TrinityCore's bot system, this method ensures that all bot-related account data
    and associated resources are properly disposed of when the manager instance is
    no longer needed. The destructor is automatically invoked when the object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotAccountMgr instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotAccountMgr* mgr = new BotAccountMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete mgr; // Destructor is called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It's important to ensure that all references to bot accounts are properly
    handled before destruction to prevent dangling pointers or resource access violations.
