documentation:
  brief: Logs a debug message to the TrinityCore logging system with DeathRecoveryManager
    context
  description: The LogDebug method outputs a formatted debug message to the game's
    logging subsystem, specifically tagged with the DeathRecoveryManager context.
    This method is typically used during development and debugging to track the flow
    of death recovery operations, monitor state changes, or log important events related
    to player death handling and resurrection processes. The message will be prefixed
    with relevant manager information to aid in debugging and monitoring. This method
    does not perform any game logic or state changes, but simply records diagnostic
    information for developers and administrators.
  parameters:
  - name: message
    description: The debug message string to be logged. This should contain relevant
      diagnostic information about the current death recovery operation or state being
      tracked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Logging
    code: "void SomeDeathRecoveryFunction() {\n    DeathRecoveryManager manager;\n\
      \    manager.LogDebug(\"Player death detected, initiating recovery process\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Recovery State Changes
    code: "void ProcessPlayerDeath(Player* player) {\n    DeathRecoveryManager manager;\n\
      \    manager.LogDebug(\"Processing death for player: \" + std::to_string(player->GetGUID().GetCounter()));\n\
      \    // ... recovery logic ...\n    manager.LogDebug(\"Recovery process completed\
      \ successfully\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on TrinityCore's logging infrastructure and will only
    output messages if the debug log level is enabled. The logged messages will include
    timestamp and thread information automatically. This method is const, meaning
    it does not modify any member variables of the DeathRecoveryManager instance.
  warnings: Debug logging can impact performance in production environments when enabled
    at high frequency. Ensure that debug logs are disabled or minimized in live server
    deployments. The message parameter should be carefully constructed to avoid potential
    security issues if used with user-provided data.
