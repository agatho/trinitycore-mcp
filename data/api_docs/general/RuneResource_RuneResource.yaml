documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new RuneResource object with default values.
  description: The RuneResource constructor initializes a new instance of the RuneResource
    class, setting up internal state for tracking rune-related resources. This method
    is typically called when creating a new rune resource manager or during player
    initialization in World of Warcraft's combat system. The constructor ensures that
    all internal rune counters and cooldown states are properly initialized to their
    default values, allowing subsequent operations on rune resources to function correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Construction
    code: 'RuneResource resource;

      // Initializes a new RuneResource object with default state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when creating a new RuneResource
    instance. It's important to note that this method does not perform any validation
    or initialization of external dependencies, as it only sets up internal state
    variables.
