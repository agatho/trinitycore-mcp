documentation:
  brief: Dumps the scheduled bot actions for a specified bot GUID to the console or
    log.
  description: The DumpBotSchedule method outputs detailed information about the scheduled
    actions and timing for a specific bot identified by its GUID. This function is
    primarily used for debugging and monitoring purposes, allowing developers or administrators
    to inspect what actions a bot is planned to perform at what times. It typically
    logs this information to the server console or log files, providing visibility
    into the bot's scheduling behavior. The method does not modify any internal state
    but serves as a diagnostic tool. This function assumes that the bot with the given
    GUID exists and has active scheduling data.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose schedule is to be dumped.
      Must correspond to an existing bot in the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Dump Schedule for a Specific Bot
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.DumpBotSchedule(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for use in development and debugging environments.
    It may produce verbose output depending on the number of scheduled actions. The
    GUID parameter must be valid; otherwise, the behavior is undefined or may result
    in no output.
