  class: QuestHubDatabase
  method: ValidateHubData
  signature: void QuestHubDatabase::ValidateHubData()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the integrity and consistency of quest hub data within the database.
  description: The ValidateHubData method performs a comprehensive check on the quest
    hub data stored in the database to ensure all entries are valid, consistent, and
    conform to expected formats. This method typically verifies that referenced quest
    IDs exist, that required fields are populated, and that relationships between
    quest hubs and associated quests are correct. It may also check for data corruption
    or inconsistencies that could affect quest functionality in the game world. The
    validation process is crucial for maintaining database integrity and preventing
    runtime errors during quest handling operations.

  - title: Basic Validation Call
    code: 'QuestHubDatabase db;

      db.ValidateHubData();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or maintenance windows
    to ensure database consistency. It may generate log entries for any validation
    failures found, which should be reviewed by administrators. The validation process
    might be resource-intensive on large databases and could benefit from being run
    asynchronously.
  warnings: Calling this method during active gameplay may cause performance degradation
    or temporary locking of database resources. It's recommended to execute ValidateHubData
    during low-traffic periods or server maintenance windows.
