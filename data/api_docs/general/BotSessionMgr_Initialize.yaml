  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotSessionMgr::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot session manager, setting up internal data structures
    and preparing for bot session handling.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotSessionMgr class for managing
    bot sessions by initializing required internal data structures, loading configuration
    settings, and establishing necessary system resources. This method should be called
    once during server startup or when the bot system is enabled. It performs essential
    setup tasks such as allocating memory for session tracking, initializing synchronization
    primitives, and validating prerequisite conditions. The method ensures that all
    dependent systems are ready before allowing bot sessions to be created or managed.
    If initialization fails, subsequent operations may not function correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all internal components
    were properly set up; returns false if any critical error occurred during setup,
    such as memory allocation failure or invalid configuration data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotSessionMgr* sessionMgr = BotSessionMgr::Instance();\nif (sessionMgr->Initialize())\
      \ {\n    // Initialization successful\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot session manager\
      \ initialized successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Initialization failed\n  \
      \  sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize bot session manager.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle.
    Multiple calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The initialization
    process is not thread-safe and should be performed before any concurrent access
    to bot sessions occurs.
  warnings: Calling Initialize after the manager has already been initialized may
    lead to memory corruption or inconsistent state. Ensure that all prerequisites
    for bot functionality are met before calling this method.
