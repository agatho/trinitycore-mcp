  method: GetUnitCriticalChanceDone
  signature: float Unit::GetUnitCriticalChanceDone(int attackType) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the critical chance percentage for a specific attack type.
  description: This method retrieves the critical chance percentage for a given attack
    type, which determines the likelihood that an attack will be critical. The method
    is used to calculate critical hit chances for different attack types such as melee,
    ranged, or spell attacks. It returns a float value representing the percentage
    chance of a critical hit, with values typically ranging from 0 to 100. This method
    is commonly used in combat calculations and game mechanics related to critical
    hits.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the critical chance percentage for the
    specified attack type. The value can range from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no
    chance of critical hit, and higher values indicate increased probability of critical
    hit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float criticalChance = unit->GetUnitCriticalChanceDone(ATTACK_TYPE_MELEE);\n\
      if (criticalChance > 0.0f) {\n    // Process critical hit logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and typically used in combat calculations.
    It may be affected by buffs, debuffs, or character stats that influence critical
    chance. The method should be called with appropriate attack type parameters to
    ensure correct results.
  warnings: The method might return zero if no critical chance modifiers are applied
    to the specified attack type. Care should be taken when using this method in combat
    calculations as it may affect game balance and player experience.
