  method: OptimizeInterruptTiming
  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeInterruptTiming()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the timing of interrupt abilities for the Monk AI to maximize effectiveness
    during combat.
  description: The OptimizeInterruptTiming method adjusts and calculates the optimal
    moments to use interrupt abilities within the Monk AI's behavior. This method
    evaluates current combat conditions, enemy casting states, and the Monk's available
    abilities to determine when an interrupt should be executed for maximum impact.
    It is typically invoked during the AI's update cycle to ensure timely and strategic
    use of interrupts such as Dampen Harm, Touch of Death, or other crowd control
    abilities that can disrupt enemy spellcasting. The method considers factors like
    cooldowns, mana costs, and priority targets to make intelligent decisions about
    when to apply interrupts.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    OptimizeInterruptTiming();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core Monk AI decision-making system and should
    be called regularly during combat updates. It relies on accurate state tracking
    of both the Monk and its targets to make effective interrupt decisions.
