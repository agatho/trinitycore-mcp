documentation:
  brief: Teleports a player to an exploit location within the battleground.
  description: The TeleportPlayerToExploitLocation method is responsible for moving
    a specified player to a predetermined location within the battleground, typically
    used during game mechanics such as handling players who have exploited game rules
    or moved outside of valid play areas. This method ensures that players are returned
    to appropriate locations to maintain fair play and game integrity. The teleportation
    usually occurs at specific points defined by the battleground's logic, often related
    to respawn points or safe zones. It is commonly invoked when a player's position
    becomes invalid due to exploits, glitches, or rule violations.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in battleground event handling
    code: "void OnPlayerExploitDetected(Battleground* bg, Player* player) {\n    if\
      \ (player && bg) {\n        bg->TeleportPlayerToExploitLocation(player);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal battleground teleportation logic and may
    involve checking player state, validating position, and ensuring the destination
    is within acceptable bounds. It should be used carefully to avoid disrupting normal
    gameplay or causing client-side issues.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method could result in players being teleported
    to invalid locations or causing client desyncs. Ensure that the player object
    is valid and that the battleground context is properly initialized before calling
    this method.
