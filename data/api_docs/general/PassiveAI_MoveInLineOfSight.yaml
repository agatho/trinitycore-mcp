documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming units that come within the AI's line of sight.
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight method is a core part of the PassiveAI class
    in TrinityCore, responsible for handling events when units enter the AI-controlled
    creature's line of sight. This method typically triggers the AI to perform actions
    such as aggroing enemies, initiating combat behavior, or updating target selection.
    It is automatically called by the game engine when unit movement brings them into
    the creature's detection range. The method does not take any parameters and serves
    purely as an event handler for visibility-based triggers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ExampleCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // MoveInLineOfSight is automatically called by the\
      \ core when units come into view\n    // No explicit call needed in most cases\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI event system and should not be overridden
    unless custom behavior is required. The PassiveAI class typically does not perform
    aggressive actions, so this method may simply update internal state without initiating
    combat.
