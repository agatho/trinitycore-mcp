  class: CharacterSelectedEvent
  method: CharacterSelectedEvent
  signature: void CharacterSelectedEvent::CharacterSelectedEvent(int guid, int req)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a character is selected in the game world, typically
    during login or character switching.
  description: The CharacterSelectedEvent method is invoked when a player selects
    a character from their character list, either during initial login or when switching
    between characters. This method is part of the TrinityCore's event system and
    is responsible for performing necessary operations such as loading character data,
    initializing player state, and triggering related game events. The method takes
    a unique identifier (guid) for the selected character and a request parameter
    that may indicate the type of selection or action being performed. It serves as
    a critical point in the character lifecycle within the World of Warcraft emulation
    environment.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the selected character. This is a
      numeric value that uniquely identifies the character within the database and
      is used to load all associated character data.
  - name: req
    description: The request parameter indicating the type or context of the character
      selection. This could represent different actions such as login, switch, or
      other character-related operations, with specific values defined by the game's
      internal logic.
  returns: null

    code: "#include \"CharacterSelectedEvent.h\"\n\nvoid OnPlayerCharacterSelect(Player*\
      \ player, int guid, int req)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Player %s selected character\
      \ GUID: %d with request type: %d\", \n                   player->GetName().c_str(),\
      \ guid, req);\n    CharacterSelectedEvent event;\n    event.CharacterSelectedEvent(guid,\
      \ req);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore server during
    character selection processes. Developers should ensure that all necessary character
    data is properly loaded and validated before this method completes. The implementation
    may involve database queries and state initialization.
  warnings: Improper handling of the guid parameter can lead to incorrect character
    loading or security vulnerabilities. Ensure that the request parameter is properly
    validated to prevent unexpected behavior during character selection.
