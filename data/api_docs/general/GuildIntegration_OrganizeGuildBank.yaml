  class: GuildIntegration
  method: OrganizeGuildBank
  signature: void GuildIntegration::OrganizeGuildBank(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Organizes the guild bank inventory by sorting items into appropriate slots
    based on item type and quality.
  description: The OrganizeGuildBank method reorganizes the contents of a guild's
    bank vault, arranging items in a standardized order according to their type, quality,
    and other attributes. This function ensures that guild members can quickly locate
    items by sorting them logically within the bank interface. The method typically
    handles item stacking, proper slot assignment, and maintains the integrity of
    the guild bank's inventory structure. It may also update internal data structures
    and trigger UI refreshes for all online guild members.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who initiated the organization request. This parameter is used to validate
      permissions and track which player performed the action.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.OrganizeGuildBank(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Permission Check Before Organization
    code: "if (player->GetSession()->GetSecurity() >= SEC_MODERATOR)\n{\n    int playerId\
      \ = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n    GuildIntegration guildInt;\n    guildInt.OrganizeGuildBank(&playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the guild bank is not currently being
    accessed by other players to prevent data corruption. The organization process
    may temporarily lock the guild bank interface for all members during execution.
  warnings: Calling this method while another player is actively interacting with
    the guild bank can result in lost or corrupted inventory data. Always verify that
    no other operations are in progress before invoking OrganizeGuildBank.
