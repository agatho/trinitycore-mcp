  class: MovementInfo
  method: SetMovementFlags
  signature: void MovementInfo::SetMovementFlags(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the movement flags for a MovementInfo object, defining the current movement
    state of a game entity.
  description: The SetMovementFlags method updates the movement flags stored within
    a MovementInfo object, which are used to track and communicate the current movement
    state of a player or creature in the World of Warcraft client. These flags determine
    how the entity is moving, such as walking, running, swimming, flying, or being
    affected by root/slow effects. The method directly modifies internal state that
    is serialized and sent to clients during movement updates. This operation typically
    occurs during movement handling within the game loop, particularly when processing
    player input or AI-driven movement changes.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the movement flags to set.
      These flags are defined by constants such as MOVEMENTFLAG_NONE, MOVEMENTFLAG_FORWARD,
      MOVEMENTFLAG_BACKWARD, MOVEMENTFLAG_LEFT, MOVEMENTFLAG_RIGHT, MOVEMENTFLAG_JUMPING,
      MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING, MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING, etc., which can be combined using
      bitwise OR operations to represent complex movement states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting basic walking movement flag
    code: 'MovementInfo movementInfo;

      movementInfo.SetMovementFlags(MOVEMENTFLAG_FORWARD);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combining multiple movement flags for running and swimming
    code: 'MovementInfo movementInfo;

      uint32 combinedFlags = MOVEMENTFLAG_FORWARD | MOVEMENTFLAG_SWIMMING | MOVEMENTFLAG_RUNMODE;

      movementInfo.SetMovementFlags(combinedFlags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state that affects network serialization
    and client-side movement behavior. It should be called carefully during movement
    processing to avoid inconsistent states. The movement flags are typically updated
    in response to player input, AI decisions, or environmental effects like water
    or terrain changes.
  warnings: Setting incorrect or conflicting movement flags can cause unexpected client
    behavior or desynchronization between server and client. Avoid setting flags that
    contradict each other (e.g., walking and running simultaneously) unless explicitly
    supported by the game mechanics.
