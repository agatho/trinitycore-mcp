  brief: Checks if the player meets all requirements to start a quest
  description: The MeetsQuestRequirements method evaluates whether the player character
    has satisfied all prerequisite conditions necessary to begin a specific quest.
    This includes checking for completed prerequisite quests, minimum level requirements,
    required items or currency, and other game-specific conditions that must be met
    before a quest can be accepted. The method returns true if all requirements are
    fulfilled, allowing the quest to be started, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is integral to the quest system's integrity, ensuring players progress through
    content in the intended order and with appropriate character development.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all requirements to start the quest, false
    if any requirement is not met
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Requirement Check
    code: "if (player->GetQuestManager()->MeetsQuestRequirements(quest)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can accept and start the quest\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Player cannot start the quest due to unmet requirements\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!GetQuestManager()->MeetsQuestRequirements(quest))\
      \ {\n        SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REASON_NOT_READY);\n     \
      \   return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest acceptance logic\n    AddQuest(quest);\n\
      \    SendQuestUpdateAdd(quest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before displaying quest details to the player
    or when attempting to accept a quest. It performs checks against the player's
    current state including level, completed quests, inventory items, and reputation
    requirements. The implementation may cache results for performance optimization
    in frequent calls.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a substitute for proper quest validation
    during quest completion. Players might still be able to bypass certain checks
    through exploits or by manipulating their character state. Always validate quest
    completion conditions separately.
