  class: PlayerBotHooks
  method: GetInitialized
  signature: bool & PlayerBotHooks::GetInitialized()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the initialized state flag of the player bot hooks
    instance.
  description: The GetInitialized method provides access to the internal initialized
    state flag of the PlayerBotHooks class. This boolean flag indicates whether the
    player bot hooks system has been properly initialized and is ready for use. The
    method returns a non-const reference to the flag, allowing callers to both read
    and modify its value directly. This design pattern is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    architecture to manage the lifecycle of subsystems and ensure proper initialization
    order before operations are performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A non-const reference to a boolean flag indicating whether the PlayerBotHooks
    system has been initialized. True indicates successful initialization, false indicates
    that initialization has not yet occurred or has failed.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Initialization Status
    code: "if (PlayerBotHooks::GetInitialized()) {\n    // System is ready for use\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\", \"Player bot hooks are initialized\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // System not ready\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Player bot hooks\
      \ are not initialized\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Forcing Initialization State
    code: 'bool& initialized = PlayerBotHooks::GetInitialized();

      initialized = true; // Manually set to initialized state

      // This might be used in testing or specific initialization scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference allows direct modification of the internal state flag.
    Care should be taken when modifying this value directly, as improper use may lead
    to inconsistent system states. The method is typically called during subsystem
    initialization and shutdown routines in TrinityCore's player bot framework.
  warnings: Modifying the returned boolean reference directly can affect the overall
    system state. This should only be done with careful consideration of the implications
    for the entire player bot system. Avoid modifying this flag unless you understand
    the complete initialization flow of the PlayerBotHooks subsystem.
