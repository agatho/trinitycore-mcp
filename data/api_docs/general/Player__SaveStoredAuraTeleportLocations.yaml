documentation:
  brief: Saves stored aura teleport locations for the player
  description: This method saves the current teleport location information for stored
    auras in the player's database. It stores the coordinates and map information
    associated with the player's current location when teleporting to stored auras.
    The method is typically called during player logout or when changing zones to
    preserve teleportation data for future sessions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->_SaveStoredAuraTeleportLocations(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include saving the player's current position coordinates
    and map ID to database tables. Performance considerations involve database write
    operations that may impact server performance during high-volume player sessions.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is actually teleporting
    to stored auras, not during regular gameplay. Improper usage can lead to incorrect
    data storage in database.
