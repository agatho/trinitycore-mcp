  class: ConversationAI
  method: OnUpdate
  signature: void ConversationAI::OnUpdate(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the conversation AI state based on elapsed time.
  description: The OnUpdate method is called periodically by the game engine to process
    and update the state of a conversation AI. It handles timing-based logic such
    as advancing dialogue, managing NPC responses, and updating internal timers. This
    method is essential for maintaining the flow of interactive conversations with
    NPCs in World of Warcraft. The method receives a time delta (diff) parameter that
    represents the milliseconds elapsed since the last update call, allowing precise
    timing control for conversation progression.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The number of milliseconds elapsed since the last update call. This
      value is used to determine how much time has passed and adjust conversation
      state accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void ConversationAI::OnUpdate(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update conversation\
      \ timers\n    if (m_conversationTimer > 0)\n    {\n        m_conversationTimer\
      \ -= diff;\n        if (m_conversationTimer <= 0)\n        {\n            //\
      \ Proceed with next dialogue step\n            AdvanceConversation();\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the game's main update loop at regular
    intervals. Developers should ensure that time-based logic within this method does
    not introduce significant performance overhead, as it may be called frequently
    during active conversations.
