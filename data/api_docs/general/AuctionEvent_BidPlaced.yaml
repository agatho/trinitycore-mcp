api:
  class: AuctionEvent
  method: BidPlaced
  signature: AuctionEvent AuctionEvent::BidPlaced(int playerGuid, uint32 auctionId,
    uint64 bidAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new AuctionEvent instance representing a bid placement
    action in the auction house system.
  description: The BidPlaced method is a static factory function that constructs and
    returns an AuctionEvent object to represent a successful bid placement on an auction
    item. This method is typically invoked when a player places a bid on an auction,
    either increasing their existing bid or making a new bid for an item. The returned
    AuctionEvent encapsulates the event data including the player's unique identifier
    (GUID), the auction ID of the item being bid upon, and the amount of the bid placed.
    This method is part of the auction house event system that tracks all auction-related
    activities in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who placed the bid. Must
      be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: auctionId
    description: The unique identifier of the auction for which the bid was placed.
      This corresponds to the auction entry in the database.
  - name: bidAmount
    description: The amount of gold (in copper) that the player has bid on the auction
      item. Must be a positive value greater than or equal to the current bid.
  returns: An AuctionEvent object representing the bid placement event, containing
    all relevant information about the bid action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bid Placement
    code: AuctionEvent event = AuctionEvent::BidPlaced(12345, 67890, 50000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Auction House Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerBid(uint32 playerGuid, uint32 auctionId, uint64 bidAmount)\
      \ {\n    AuctionEvent event = AuctionEvent::BidPlaced(playerGuid, auctionId,\
      \ bidAmount);\n    // Process the event further\n    event.Process();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be a static factory function and does not modify
    any global state directly. It creates an immutable AuctionEvent object that can
    be processed by other systems in the auction house logic. The method assumes valid
    input parameters and does not perform validation checks internally.
  warnings: Ensure that bidAmount represents a valid gold amount (in copper) and that
    playerGuid and auctionId correspond to existing entities in the game world. Invalid
    GUIDs or auction IDs may lead to undefined behavior when processing the returned
    AuctionEvent.
