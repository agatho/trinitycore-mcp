  class: Battleground
  method: RewardHonorToTeam
  signature: void Battleground::RewardHonorToTeam(int Honor, int team)
documentation:
  brief: Rewards honor points to all players on the specified team within the battleground.
  description: The RewardHonorToTeam method distributes a specified amount of honor
    points to all active players belonging to the given team in the current battleground.
    This function is typically invoked at the end of a battleground match to reward
    players for their performance. The method ensures that each eligible player on
    the team receives the honor bonus, taking into account factors such as player
    activity and participation duration. Honor rewards are an important aspect of
    World of Warcraft's competitive gameplay system, encouraging player engagement
    in battlegrounds and PvP activities.
  parameters:
  - name: Honor
    description: The amount of honor points to be awarded to each player on the team.
      Must be a non-negative integer value representing the honor bonus.
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier to which the honor will be awarded. Typically
      0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde, though values may vary based on battleground
      implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Honor Reward Example
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->RewardHonorToTeam(100, TEAM_ALLIANCE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reward Honor to Both Teams
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->RewardHonorToTeam(150, TEAM_ALLIANCE);\n    bg->RewardHonorToTeam(150,\
      \ TEAM_HORDE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally iterates through all players in the specified team
    and calls their individual honor reward functions. It's important to note that
    this function should only be called during appropriate battleground states where
    rewards are valid, typically after a match has concluded. The method does not
    validate whether the honor amount is within reasonable limits; it simply distributes
    the provided value.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper battleground match contexts may
    result in incorrect honor distribution or game state inconsistencies. Ensure that
    the battleground is in a valid state before calling this function, and verify
    that the team parameter corresponds to valid team identifiers for the specific
    battleground type.
