  method: DecreaseScriptCount
  signature: void ScriptMgr::DecreaseScriptCount()
documentation:
  brief: Decrements the global script count managed by the ScriptMgr instance.
  description: The DecreaseScriptCount method is used to reduce the internal script
    counter maintained by the ScriptMgr singleton. This counter typically tracks the
    number of active or registered scripts within the TrinityCore system. The method
    is generally called when a script is being unloaded, removed, or destroyed to
    ensure proper cleanup and resource management. It plays a role in maintaining
    accurate script lifecycle tracking during server runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: ScriptMgr::instance()->DecreaseScriptCount();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core scripting system.
    Developers should not usually call this directly unless implementing custom script
    lifecycle management. The internal counter may be used for debugging, logging,
    or ensuring proper shutdown sequences.
  warnings: Calling this method without understanding its role in the script lifecycle
    can lead to incorrect state tracking and potential memory leaks. It's recommended
    to use this only when necessary and in conjunction with corresponding IncreaseScriptCount
    calls.
