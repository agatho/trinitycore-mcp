  class: FormulaScript
  method: FormulaScript
  signature: void FormulaScript::FormulaScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new FormulaScript instance with the specified name.
  description: The FormulaScript constructor initializes a new formula script instance
    with the provided name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore scripting
    system to register and configure custom game formulas or calculations. The name
    parameter serves as an identifier for the script, allowing it to be referenced
    later in the game's formula evaluation system. This constructor likely sets up
    internal data structures and registers the script with the appropriate subsystems
    for execution during gameplay events.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that serves as the unique identifier for
      this FormulaScript instance. The name is used to register and retrieve the script
      within the TrinityCore scripting framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic FormulaScript Initialization
    code: FormulaScript* script = new FormulaScript("CustomDamageFormula");
    language: cpp
  - title: Using FormulaScript in a Custom Module
    code: "class MyCustomModule : public Module {\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\
      \ override {\n        FormulaScript* damageFormula = new FormulaScript(\"PlayerDamageCalculation\"\
      );\n        // Further configuration of the formula script\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of TrinityCore's scripting API and should only be
    called during module initialization or when dynamically creating new formula scripts.
    The name parameter must be a valid, null-terminated string; passing NULL or invalid
    pointers may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on existing FormulaScript instances
    as it will overwrite internal state. Ensure that the name parameter is unique
    within your module to prevent conflicts with other registered scripts.
