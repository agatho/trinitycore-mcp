documentation:
  brief: Applies buffs to the warlock bot based on baseline rotation logic.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for applying appropriate buffs
    to a warlock bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically manages
    the application of beneficial effects such as buffs that enhance the warlock's
    combat effectiveness, including stat increases, damage boosts, or other gameplay
    enhancements. It operates within the context of a baseline rotation system designed
    to optimize the warlock's performance during combat scenarios. The method likely
    evaluates the current state of the bot and applies necessary buffs according to
    predefined rules or conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage in Warlock AI
    code: 'WarlockBaselineRotation rotation;

      int bot = 12345;

      rotation.ApplyBuffs(&bot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the warlock AI system and should be called during
    appropriate combat or preparation phases. The 'bot' parameter is expected to be
    a valid identifier for the warlock instance within the TrinityCore environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid warlock instance before
    calling this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method does
    not perform validation on the input and assumes proper initialization of the warlock
    state.
