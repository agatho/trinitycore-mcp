  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: EvaluatePurgeBenefit
  signature: bool DispelCoordinator::EvaluatePurgeBenefit(const PurgeableBuff & buff,
    Unit * enemy) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether purging a specific buff from an enemy unit would be beneficial
    for the AI's tactical decision-making.
  description: The EvaluatePurgeBenefit method determines if removing a particular
    buff from an enemy unit provides strategic advantage. This function is typically
    used by AI systems to make decisions about when and which buffs to dispel. It
    considers factors such as the type of buff, its duration, and potential impact
    on the enemy's combat effectiveness. The method takes into account both the immediate
    tactical benefits and long-term consequences of purging a buff. It is part of
    the DispelCoordinator class, which manages AI decision-making for spell dispelling
    in TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: buff
    description: A reference to a PurgeableBuff structure containing information about
      the buff to be evaluated. This includes buff type, duration, and other relevant
      properties that determine its strategic value.
  - name: enemy
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the enemy target from which
      the buff is to be purged. The method evaluates the benefit based on this unit's
      current state and role in combat.
  returns: Returns true if purging the specified buff from the enemy would provide
    a tactical advantage, such as reducing their damage output or removing a harmful
    debuff. Returns false if purging would not be beneficial or could potentially
    harm the AI's strategy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (dispelCoordinator.EvaluatePurgeBenefit(purgeableBuff, targetEnemy))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with dispelling this buff\n    DoDispellingAction(purgeableBuff,\
      \ targetEnemy);\n} else {\n    // Consider other actions\n    SelectAlternativeStrategy();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell targeting system
    code: "void AIController::ProcessTargetingLogic(Unit* target) {\n    for (auto&\
      \ buff : target->GetPurgeableBuffs()) {\n        if (dispelCoordinator.EvaluatePurgeBenefit(buff,\
      \ target)) {\n            // Queue this buff for dispelling\n            dispelQueue.push_back({buff,\
      \ target});\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI-controlled units such as NPCs or bosses.
    The evaluation logic may be influenced by difficulty settings and encounter-specific
    rules. Performance is optimized for frequent calls during combat, so the implementation
    should avoid expensive operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the PurgeableBuff structure contains valid data before calling
    this method, as invalid buff information could lead to incorrect tactical decisions.
    Be cautious when using this in high-frequency loops as it may impact performance
    if not properly cached or optimized.
