  class: GossipHandler

  signature: int32 GossipHandler::ScoreOption(const GossipMenuOption & option, InteractionType
    desiredType) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a scoring value for a gossip menu option based on the
    desired interaction type.
  description: The ScoreOption method calculates a relevance score for a given GossipMenuOption,
    taking into account the desired interaction type. This scoring mechanism helps
    determine how well a particular gossip option matches the player's intended action
    or the current context of the interaction. The method is typically used internally
    by the GossipHandler to prioritize or filter menu options based on game state
    or player intent. It does not modify any internal state and is purely a calculation-based
    method.
  parameters:
  - name: option
    description: The GossipMenuOption object to be scored. This represents a single
      entry in the gossip menu, including its type, text, and associated data.
  - name: desiredType
    description: The InteractionType that indicates what kind of interaction is desired.
      This influences how the scoring is calculated for the given option.
  returns: An int32 value representing the calculated score for the gossip menu option.
    Higher scores indicate better relevance or match to the desired interaction type.
    Negative values may be returned if the option is not suitable for the desired
    interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Scoring a Gossip Option
    code: 'GossipMenuOption option;

      option.m_gossipOption = GOSSIP_OPTION_QUESTGIVER;

      option.m_text = "I want to quest.";

      InteractionType type = INTERACTION_TYPE_QUEST;

      int32 score = gossipHandler->ScoreOption(option, type);

      // Score will be positive if the option matches the quest interaction type.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal gossip handling logic and is not typically
    called directly by external code. The scoring algorithm may vary depending on
    the specific implementation details of the GossipHandler class, but generally
    considers factors like option type, player state, and interaction context.
