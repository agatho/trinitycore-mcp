documentation:
  brief: Destroys the bot session manager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the IBotSessionManager class is responsible for
    properly cleaning up all allocated resources and terminating active bot sessions
    managed by this instance. It ensures that any ongoing connections, memory allocations,
    or internal data structures are safely released when the manager object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method is typically invoked automatically
    by the C++ runtime during object destruction, but may also be called manually
    in certain cleanup scenarios within the TrinityCore framework.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of bot session manager
    code: "void Cleanup() {\n    IBotSessionManager* manager = new IBotSessionManager();\n\
      \    // ... perform operations with manager ...\n    delete manager; // Destructor\
      \ is automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should not be called directly unless managing the object's
    lifetime manually. The destruction process includes cleanup of all active bot
    sessions, releasing memory, and ensuring no dangling references remain in the
    system.
