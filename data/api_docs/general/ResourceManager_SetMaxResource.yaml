  class: ResourceManager
  method: SetMaxResource
  signature: void ResourceManager::SetMaxResource(ResourceType type, uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum amount of a specified resource type.
  description: The SetMaxResource method configures the upper limit for a given resource
    type within the ResourceManager. This method is typically used to adjust resource
    caps such as health, mana, or energy for players or game entities. It directly
    modifies internal resource tracking structures and may affect gameplay mechanics
    that depend on resource limits. The change takes immediate effect and can be used
    during runtime to dynamically modify resource availability.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The ResourceType enum value specifying which resource type to modify
      (e.g., HEALTH, MANA, ENERGY). Valid values are defined in the ResourceType enumeration.
  - name: amount
    description: The new maximum value for the specified resource type. Must be a
      non-negative integer representing the upper bound of the resource capacity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Mana
    code: resourceManager.SetMaxResource(ResourceType::MANA, 1000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Player Health Cap
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      resourceManager.SetMaxResource(ResourceType::HEALTH, player->GetLevel() * 100);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method updates internal resource tracking and should be called carefully
    to avoid unintended gameplay effects. It does not validate whether the new maximum
    is reasonable compared to current resource values or other game parameters.
  warnings: Setting a very high maximum value may cause performance issues or overflow
    in certain systems. Ensure that changes to resource limits are consistent with
    game balance and do not introduce exploits.
