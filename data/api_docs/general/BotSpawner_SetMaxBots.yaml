  class: BotSpawner
  method: SetMaxBots
  signature: void BotSpawner::SetMaxBots(uint32 maxBots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bots that can be spawned by this spawner instance.
  description: The SetMaxBots method configures the upper limit for the number of
    bots that the BotSpawner instance is allowed to create and manage. This value
    acts as a cap to prevent unlimited bot generation, which could lead to performance
    degradation or game balance issues. The method updates an internal counter that
    is checked during bot spawning operations. Setting this value to zero effectively
    disables bot spawning through this spawner. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with other spawner configuration methods to define the behavior of automated bot
    management systems.
  parameters:
  - name: maxBots
    description: The maximum number of bots that this spawner can manage. Must be
      a non-negative integer value. A value of zero disables bot spawning, while any
      positive value sets an upper limit on the number of bots.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Bots to 10
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner;

      spawner.SetMaxBots(10);

      // This allows up to 10 bots to be spawned by this spawner instance.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Bot Spawning
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner;

      spawner.SetMaxBots(0);

      // This disables all bot spawning for this spawner instance.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies an internal state variable and does not perform
    any validation beyond ensuring the input is a valid uint32. The actual enforcement
    of the limit occurs during bot creation attempts, not when this method is called.
    Multiple calls to SetMaxBots will overwrite previous values without any cumulative
    effect.
  warnings: Setting maxBots to a very high value may cause performance issues in environments
    with limited resources or when used in conjunction with other spawners that do
    not enforce their own limits. Changing this value while bots are already active
    may not affect existing bots, only future spawning operations.
