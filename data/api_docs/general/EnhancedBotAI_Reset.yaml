documentation:
  brief: Resets the EnhancedBotAI state to its initial conditions
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the EnhancedBotAI instance,
    clearing any existing state and preparing it for a fresh operation. This typically
    involves resetting internal flags, clearing cached data, and ensuring all AI subsystems
    are in their default configuration. The method is commonly invoked when a bot
    needs to be restarted or reconfigured without destroying the object itself. It
    ensures that subsequent AI behavior starts from a clean slate, which is essential
    for maintaining predictable bot performance and preventing state-related bugs.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'EnhancedBotAI* botAI = new EnhancedBotAI();

      // ... perform some AI operations ...

      botAI->Reset(); // Reset the AI to initial state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before reusing an existing EnhancedBotAI instance
    to avoid carryover of stale data or inconsistent internal states. It's recommended
    to call Reset() after significant changes to bot configuration or when transitioning
    between different AI modes.
