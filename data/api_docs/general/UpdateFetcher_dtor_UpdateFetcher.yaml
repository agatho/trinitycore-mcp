documentation:
  brief: Destroys an UpdateFetcher instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the UpdateFetcher class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This typically includes releasing references to game objects,
    canceling pending updates, or freeing internal buffers. In the context of TrinityCore's
    update system, this method ensures that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur
    when an UpdateFetcher instance is removed from scope or explicitly deleted. The
    destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when the object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of UpdateFetcher
    code: 'UpdateFetcher* fetcher = new UpdateFetcher();

      // ... use fetcher ...

      delete fetcher; // Triggers ~UpdateFetcher()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only once per object instance. It is important
    to ensure that no other code holds references to the object when the destructor
    is invoked, as this could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The UpdateFetcher
    class likely manages internal state related to game object updates, so proper
    cleanup ensures consistency in the game world state.
