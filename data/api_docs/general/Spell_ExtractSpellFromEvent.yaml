  signature: const Spell * Spell::ExtractSpellFromEvent(BasicEvent * event)
documentation:
  brief: Extracts and returns the Spell object associated with a BasicEvent
  description: This method retrieves the Spell object from a BasicEvent, allowing
    access to spell-related data and functionality within the context of game mechanics.
    It is commonly used in event handling systems where spells are triggered through
    various events such as spell casts, periodic effects, or other game actions. The
    method ensures proper retrieval of spell information from event-based contexts,
    making it essential for spell processing and event management in TrinityCore's
    core architecture.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Spell object associated with the BasicEvent. If
    no valid spell is found in the event, it returns nullptr, indicating that the
    event does not contain spell data or that the spell has been invalidated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "const Spell* spell = spell->ExtractSpellFromEvent(event);\nif (spell)\n\
      {\n    // Process spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with event handling
    code: "Spell* spell = ExtractSpellFromEvent(event);\nif (spell && spell->IsSpellValid())\n\
      {\n    // Handle spell logic\n    SpellInfo* info = spell->GetSpellInfo();\n\
      \    // Process spell data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with event management systems
    and requires careful handling of event pointers to avoid accessing invalid memory.
    Performance considerations include checking for valid event pointers before calling
    this method, as it may involve pointer dereferencing operations.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper event validation.
    Calling it on invalid or null events can lead to memory access violations or undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that the event contains valid spell data before invoking
    this method.
