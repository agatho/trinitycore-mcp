  class: Unit
  method: GetBaseAttackTime
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetBaseAttackTime(int att) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the base attack time for a specified attack type.
  description: This method retrieves the base attack time in milliseconds for a given
    attack type, which is used to determine the speed at which a unit performs melee
    attacks. The attack type parameter specifies whether the method should return
    the main hand, off hand, or ranged attack time. This value directly affects combat
    calculations and damage output in World of Warcraft mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the base attack time in milliseconds for the specified attack type.
    A value of 0 indicates that no attack time is available for the given attack type,
    which may occur when the unit does not have a valid weapon or attack type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 baseAttackTime = unit->GetBaseAttackTime(BASE_ATTACK);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "uint32 baseAttackTime = unit->GetBaseAttackTime(OFF_ATTACK);\nif (baseAttackTime\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use baseAttackTime for calculations\n    // ... \n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle case where no off-hand attack is available\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat calculations and damage output determination.
    Performance considerations include that this method should be called sparingly
    during combat processing, as it involves accessing unit's weapon data. Thread
    safety is not an issue since the method is const and does not modify any state.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method with different attack types,
    as incorrect usage can lead to inaccurate combat calculations. The method may
    return 0 for invalid attack types or when no weapon is available, which could
    cause division by zero errors in calculations if not handled properly.
