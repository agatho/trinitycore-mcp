  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: ProcessSpawnRequest
  signature: void BotSpawnOrchestrator::ProcessSpawnRequest(const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a bot spawn request by handling the associated logic and state
    changes within the orchestrator.
  description: The ProcessSpawnRequest method in the BotSpawnOrchestrator class is
    responsible for managing incoming bot spawn requests. It evaluates the provided
    request identifier, determines the appropriate spawning behavior based on internal
    logic, and updates the state of the spawn orchestrator accordingly. This method
    typically handles queue management, validation of spawn conditions, and triggering
    the actual creation or activation of bot entities within the game world. The method
    ensures that spawn requests are processed in a controlled manner while maintaining
    consistency with the overall bot management system.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific spawn request to
      be processed. This value typically corresponds to a unique request ID or type
      code used internally by the orchestrator to determine how to handle the spawn
      operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;

      int spawnRequest = 12345;

      orchestrator.ProcessSpawnRequest(spawnRequest);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Manager
    code: "void HandleBotSpawnCommand(Player* player, int requestType) {\n    BotSpawnOrchestrator&\
      \ orchestrator = BotSpawnOrchestrator::Instance();\n    orchestrator.ProcessSpawnRequest(requestType);\n\
      \    // Additional logic to notify player or update UI\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called from a thread-safe context as it may interact
    with shared resources such as spawn queues and bot state tracking. The internal
    implementation likely includes checks for valid request types, resource availability,
    and cooldown periods between spawns.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the request parameter
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the request identifier
    is within expected ranges before invoking this method.
