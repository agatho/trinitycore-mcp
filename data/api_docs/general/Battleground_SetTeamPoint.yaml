  class: Battleground
  method: SetTeamPoint
  signature: void Battleground::SetTeamPoint(int team, int points)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the point value for a specified team in the battleground.
  description: The SetTeamPoint method assigns a specific point value to a given team
    within the battleground context. This method is typically used to configure scoring
    mechanics for different teams during gameplay, allowing developers to define how
    many points each team should earn under certain conditions. The method operates
    on the internal team point tracking system of the battleground and updates the
    score accordingly. It's commonly invoked during battleground initialization or
    when modifying scoring rules dynamically.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier (0 for alliance, 1 for horde) whose points are
      being set.
  - name: points
    description: The number of points to assign to the specified team. Can be positive
      or negative values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Points for Alliance Team
    code: "Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(player->GetBattlegroundId());\n\
      if (bg)\n{\n    bg->SetTeamPoint(0, 100); // Set alliance team points to 100\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Negative Points for Horde Team
    code: "Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(player->GetBattlegroundId());\n\
      if (bg)\n{\n    bg->SetTeamPoint(1, -50); // Deduct 50 points from horde team\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal point tracking of the battleground.
    It should be used carefully as it may affect scoring calculations and win/loss
    conditions. The method does not validate whether the provided team ID is valid,
    so calling with an invalid team index (e.g., greater than 1) may result in undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Using this method with invalid parameters can lead to incorrect scoring
    or crashes. Always ensure that the team parameter is either 0 (alliance) or 1
    (horde). Avoid calling this method during critical gameplay moments without proper
    synchronization.
