  brief: Removes expired corpses from the world based on configured corpse removal
    time
  description: The RemoveOldCorpses method iterates through all existing corpses in
    the game world and removes those that have exceeded the maximum corpse removal
    time threshold. This cleanup operation ensures that the server does not accumulate
    stale corpse data indefinitely, which could impact performance and memory usage.
    The method is typically called periodically by the game loop or through dedicated
    cleanup routines. Corpses are considered expired when their creation time plus
    the configured corpse removal delay has passed.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    sWorld->RemoveOldCorpses();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other operations ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the World class's periodic
    cleanup routines. The corpse removal time is configurable via the ' corpses.remove_time'
    server configuration option. The operation is thread-safe and does not require
    explicit locking as it operates on a copy of the corpse list.
