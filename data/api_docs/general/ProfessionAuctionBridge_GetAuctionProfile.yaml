api:
  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: GetAuctionProfile
  signature: ProfessionAuctionProfile ProfessionAuctionBridge::GetAuctionProfile(uint32
    playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction profile data for a specified player GUID.
  description: The GetAuctionProfile method fetches the ProfessionAuctionProfile associated
    with a given player's unique identifier (GUID). This profile typically contains
    information related to the player's auction house activities, such as bid history,
    item listings, and profession-specific auction settings. The method is designed
    to provide centralized access to a player's auction behavior within the context
    of professions like Engineering, Blacksmithing, or Enchanting. It assumes that
    the player has previously interacted with the auction system and that their profile
    data exists in the database or cache.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: A unique identifier (GUID) representing the player whose auction
      profile is to be retrieved. This value must correspond to a valid player entry
      in the database.
  returns: Returns a ProfessionAuctionProfile object containing all relevant auction-related
    data for the specified player. If no profile exists for the given GUID, an empty
    or default-initialized profile may be returned depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      ProfessionAuctionProfile profile = bridge.GetAuctionProfile(playerId);

      // Use profile data for further processing or display'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Profile Validity Before Use
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nProfessionAuctionProfile profile = bridge.GetAuctionProfile(playerId);\n\
      if (!profile.IsEmpty()) {\n    // Proceed with auction logic\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Player has auction activity: \" << profile.GetBidCount() << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where no profile exists\n    std::cout << \"No\
      \ auction data found for player.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses cached or database-stored data, so performance
    may vary based on how frequently profiles are updated. It is recommended to cache
    results when used in high-frequency contexts such as real-time auction updates
    or UI refreshes.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid corresponds to an actual logged-in
    player; otherwise, undefined behavior or invalid data might be returned. Also,
    be cautious about thread safety if this method is called from multiple threads
    concurrently without proper synchronization.
