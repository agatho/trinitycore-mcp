  signature: void Battleground::IncreaseInvitedCount(int team)
documentation:
  brief: Increments the invited player count for the specified team in the battleground.
  description: The IncreaseInvitedCount method is used to increase the number of players
    that have been invited to join a specific team within a battleground. This method
    is typically called when a player is invited to join a battleground team, and
    it updates an internal counter that tracks how many players have been invited
    for each team. The method takes a single integer parameter representing the team
    ID (usually 0 for alliance and 1 for horde) and increments the corresponding invited
    count. This functionality is essential for managing battleground invitations and
    ensuring proper team balance during matchmaking and queue processing.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier for which to increment the invited count. Typically
      0 represents the Alliance team and 1 represents the Horde team.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Inviting a player to the Alliance team
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      bg->IncreaseInvitedCount(0); // Increment Alliance invited count'
    language: cpp
  - title: Managing team invitations in battleground queue
    code: "void HandlePlayerInvite(Player* player, Battleground* bg) {\n    if (bg\
      \ && bg->GetInvitedCount(0) < 15) { // Max 15 Alliance players\n        bg->IncreaseInvitedCount(0);\n\
      \        player->SetBattlegroundId(bg->GetBgId());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground matchmaking system and directly affects
    team balance. The method likely updates internal state variables that are used
    for queue management and player assignment to teams. It should only be called
    when a legitimate invitation is being processed, as incorrect usage can lead to
    imbalanced teams or queue inconsistencies.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in incorrect
    team counts, potentially causing matchmaking issues or unbalanced battlegrounds.
    Ensure that the team parameter is valid (0 or 1) before calling this method. This
    method should not be called directly by external code without understanding the
    broader battleground state management system.
