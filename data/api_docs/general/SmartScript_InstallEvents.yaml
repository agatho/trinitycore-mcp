  class: SmartScript
  method: InstallEvents
  signature: void SmartScript::InstallEvents()
documentation:
  brief: Installs and initializes all AI events for a SmartScript object, setting
    up event handlers and triggers for creature or game object behavior.
  description: The InstallEvents method is responsible for registering and configuring
    all AI events within a SmartScript instance. This method typically processes event
    definitions stored in the script data and sets up appropriate callbacks or handlers
    to respond to various game events such as creature aggro, death, spell casts,
    or player interactions. It ensures that the AI system is properly initialized
    with all necessary event triggers before the object becomes active in the world.
    The method is usually called during object creation or activation phases, and
    it's essential for proper AI behavior implementation. This method does not take
    any parameters and performs no direct return operations; instead, it modifies
    internal state to enable event-driven AI functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SmartScript Event Installation
    code: 'SmartScript* script = new SmartScript();

      script->InstallEvents();

      // AI events are now installed and ready to trigger'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during the initialization
    phase of SmartScript objects. It's important to note that InstallEvents should
    only be called once per SmartScript instance to avoid duplicate event registrations.
    The method may perform internal setup operations including memory allocation for
    event handlers and validation of event definitions.
  warnings: Calling InstallEvents multiple times on the same SmartScript object can
    lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks due to duplicate event handler registration.
    Ensure that this method is only called during object initialization, not during
    runtime when events are already active.
