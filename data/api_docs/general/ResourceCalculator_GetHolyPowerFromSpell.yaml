  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: GetHolyPowerFromSpell
  signature: uint32 ResourceCalculator::GetHolyPowerFromSpell(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the amount of holy power generated by a specified spell.
  description: The GetHolyPowerFromSpell method calculates and returns the quantity
    of holy power that a given spell would generate for the player. This function
    is typically used in conjunction with paladin class mechanics, as holy power is
    a resource consumed by certain abilities and generated through specific spells.
    The method performs internal lookups to determine the holy power value associated
    with the provided spell ID, ensuring consistency with game balance and class-specific
    behavior. It assumes that the spell ID corresponds to a valid spell known to the
    player's class and that the spell has a defined holy power generation component.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to calculate holy power
      generation. This must correspond to a valid spell in the game's database, typically
      one that is usable by paladins and generates holy power.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the amount of holy power generated
    by the specified spell. A return value of zero indicates either an invalid spell
    ID or a spell that does not generate holy power.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 holyPower = resourceCalculator.GetHolyPowerFromSpell(20473); //\
      \ Holy Shock\nif (holyPower > 0)\n{\n    // Use holyPower value for further\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Spell Validity
    code: "uint32 spellId = 184501; // Light of Dawn\nuint32 power = resourceCalculator.GetHolyPowerFromSpell(spellId);\n\
      if (power == 0)\n{\n    // Handle invalid or non-holy-power-generating spell\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Spell %u does not generate holy power.\", spellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell data tables and assumes that the provided
    spell ID exists in the game's spell database. It is intended for use within the
    context of paladin gameplay mechanics where holy power is a core resource. The
    function may return zero if the spell does not generate holy power or if the spell
    ID is invalid.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid
    spell that can generate holy power, otherwise the result will be zero. This function
    should only be called for paladin-specific spells as it's designed around paladin
    class mechanics.
