  class: LFGMgr
  method: RemoveGroupData
  signature: void LFGMgr::RemoveGroupData(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes LFG group data associated with the specified GUID from the LFG manager.
  description: The RemoveGroupData method is responsible for cleaning up and removing
    all LFG (Looking For Group) related data associated with a specific group identified
    by its GUID. This typically occurs when a group disbands, expires, or is otherwise
    removed from the LFG system. The method ensures that no stale or orphaned LFG
    data remains in the system, preventing potential issues such as duplicate entries
    or incorrect group matching. It is commonly invoked during group destruction or
    cleanup processes within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group whose LFG data should be
      removed. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the group's identifier
      in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LFGMgr* lfgMgr = sLFGMgr;

      lfgMgr->RemoveGroupData(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Group Disband Handler
    code: "void HandleGroupDisband(Player* player)\n{\n    if (Group* group = player->GetGroup())\n\
      \    {\n        uint32 groupId = group->GetId();\n        sLFGMgr->RemoveGroupData(groupId);\n\
      \        // Continue with group disband logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal cleanup operations such as removing
    entries from internal data structures, clearing associated LFG queues, and notifying
    other subsystems about the removal. It is important to ensure that this method
    is called only after verifying that no active players are still part of the group
    to avoid dangling references.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or internal errors if not properly validated. Ensure that the
    GUID corresponds to a valid LFG group before invoking this method.
