  class: BGQueueInviteEvent
  method: Abort
  signature: void BGQueueInviteEvent::Abort(uint64 e_time)
documentation:
  brief: Aborts a battleground queue invitation event, canceling the pending invite
    for a player.
  description: The BGQueueInviteEvent::Abort method cancels an ongoing battleground
    queue invitation by marking the event as aborted. This typically occurs when a
    player's queue status changes or when the invitation is no longer valid. The method
    ensures that any pending battleground invitations are properly cleared from the
    system, preventing invalid or stale invites from being processed later. It is
    commonly used during player logout, queue cancellation, or when a player rejoins
    a different queue. This method does not return any value and operates directly
    on the event's internal state.
  parameters:
  - name: e_time
    description: The expiration time for the queue invite event, specified as a uint64
      timestamp. This parameter determines when the invite should be considered expired
      and is used to manage the lifecycle of the invitation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Abort a battleground queue invite
    code: 'BGQueueInviteEvent* event = new BGQueueInviteEvent();

      uint64 expirationTime = time(nullptr) + 300; // 5 minutes from now

      event->Abort(expirationTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore battleground
    system when a player's queue status changes or when an invitation becomes obsolete.
    It is critical to ensure that this method is called with a valid expiration time
    to maintain proper queue state management.
  warnings: Calling Abort without a valid e_time parameter may lead to inconsistent
    queue states or memory leaks. Always ensure the expiration timestamp is set appropriately
    to avoid stale invites.
