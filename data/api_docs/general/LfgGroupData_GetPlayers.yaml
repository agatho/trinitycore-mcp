  class: LfgGroupData
  method: GetPlayers
  signature: const int & LfgGroupData::GetPlayers() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the number of players in the LFG group.
  description: The GetPlayers method retrieves the count of players currently registered
    in the Looking for Group (LFG) group associated with this LfgGroupData instance.
    This value represents the total number of players that have joined the group through
    the LFG system, and it is used to determine group size limits, eligibility for
    dungeon matching, and other group-based game mechanics. The returned reference
    points to an internal integer member variable that tracks the player count, ensuring
    consistency with the current state of the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the number of players in
    the LFG group. This value is always non-negative and reflects the actual count
    of players currently part of the group.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve player count for an LFG group
    code: "LfgGroupData* groupData = ...; // Assume this points to a valid LFG group\n\
      const int& playerCount = groupData->GetPlayers();\nif (playerCount >= 1 && playerCount\
      \ <= 5)\n{\n    // Process group with valid number of players\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Group has \" << playerCount << \" players\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference to an internal data member, so modifications
    to the returned value will not affect the actual group data. The value is updated
    automatically as players join or leave the LFG group through the system.
