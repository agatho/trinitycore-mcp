  class: MultiPersonalPhaseTracker
  method: RegisterTrackedObject
  signature: void MultiPersonalPhaseTracker::RegisterTrackedObject(uint32 phaseId,
    const int & phaseOwner, WorldObject * object)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a WorldObject to be tracked for a specific phase and phase owner
    within the MultiPersonalPhaseTracker system.
  description: The RegisterTrackedObject method adds a WorldObject to the tracking
    system for a given phase ID and phase owner. This allows the system to manage
    object visibility or interaction based on player phases. The method ensures that
    objects are correctly associated with their respective phase contexts, enabling
    personalized phase-based gameplay mechanics such as phased events, instance content,
    or dynamic world object visibility. It is typically used during object creation
    or phase transition events to maintain proper tracking state.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseId
    description: The unique identifier of the phase that this object should be tracked
      for. Must be a valid phase ID defined in the phase system.
  - name: phaseOwner
    description: The identifier of the phase owner (typically a player GUID or similar
      unique identifier). Used to determine which player's phase context this object
      belongs to.
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that should be registered for tracking.
      Must not be null and must be a valid object in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Registration
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      WorldObject* obj = ...;

      uint32 phaseId = 12345;

      tracker->RegisterTrackedObject(phaseId, player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), obj);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Phase-Specific Object Tracking
    code: "if (player->InPhase(78901))\n{\n    GameObject* go = ...;\n    tracker->RegisterTrackedObject(78901,\
      \ player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), go);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object initialization or when a phase
    transition occurs. It's important to ensure that the phaseId and phaseOwner are
    valid before calling this function. The system may internally store references
    to these objects, so proper cleanup should be handled when objects are destroyed.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'object' will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that all parameters are validated before calling this method.
    Incorrect phaseId or phaseOwner values can lead to tracking inconsistencies in
    phased gameplay.
