  signature: void LootCoordination::SummarizeCoordinationResults(Group * group, const
    LootSession & session)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and summarizes loot coordination results for a group during a loot
    session.
  description: The SummarizeCoordinationResults method handles the finalization of
    loot distribution decisions within a group context. It analyzes the outcomes of
    loot coordination, such as which items were awarded to which players, and prepares
    summary data for logging or display purposes. This method is typically invoked
    after all loot decisions have been made and before the loot is actually distributed
    to players. The method operates on a provided Group object and a LootSession object
    that contains the details of the ongoing loot coordination process.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group participating
      in the loot session. This parameter is required and must point to a valid group
      instance.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to a LootSession object containing the current loot coordination
      data, including decisions made during the loot process and item distribution
      details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void example() {\n    Group* group = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(123);\n \
      \   LootSession session;\n    // ... populate session with loot data ...\n \
      \   LootCoordination coordination;\n    coordination.SummarizeCoordinationResults(group,\
      \ session);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal loot coordination system in TrinityCore
    and should only be called during active loot sessions. It does not perform any
    direct player communication or item distribution; it merely summarizes the results
    for logging or display purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer and LootSession reference are valid before
    calling this method, as invalid pointers may lead to undefined behavior. This
    method assumes all loot coordination decisions have already been finalized.
