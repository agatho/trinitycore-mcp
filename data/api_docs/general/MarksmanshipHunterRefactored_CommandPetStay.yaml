documentation:
  brief: Commands the hunter's pet to stop moving and remain in place.
  description: The CommandPetStay method instructs the hunter's currently active pet
    to cease all movement and remain stationary at its current location. This command
    is typically issued when the hunter wants to hold their pet in position, often
    during combat situations where maintaining a specific distance or positioning
    is crucial. The method operates within the context of the Marksmanship Hunter's
    AI behavior and interacts with the pet's movement state. It does not affect the
    pet's ability to attack or perform other actions, only its movement behavior.

    code: "void MyHunterAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Command pet to stay during\
      \ combat\n    CommandPetStay();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's AI state machine and may trigger
    updates to the pet's movement flags. It should be called when the hunter has control
    over their pet and the pet is in a state where it can receive movement commands.
