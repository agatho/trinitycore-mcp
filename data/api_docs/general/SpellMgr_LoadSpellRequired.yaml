  brief: Loads and initializes the spell required data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadSpellRequired method is responsible for loading the spell required
    relationships from the database into memory. This method ensures that all spells
    which have prerequisites or requirements are properly loaded and available for
    use within the game system. It typically reads data from the SpellRequired table
    in the database, which defines which spells are required to be learned before
    another spell can be accessed. The method is usually called during server startup
    or when reloading spell data dynamically. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    proper spell progression and ensuring that players cannot access advanced spells
    without meeting prerequisite conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadSpellData()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellRequired();\n \
      \   // Other spell loading operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload
    operations. It should only be called after the database connection is established
    and valid. The loaded data is stored in internal lookup tables for fast access
    during spell validation checks.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries in internal data structures. Ensure that any existing spell
    required data is properly cleared before reloading.
