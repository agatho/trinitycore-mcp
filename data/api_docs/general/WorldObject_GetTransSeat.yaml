  class: WorldObject
  method: GetTransSeat
  signature: int8 WorldObject::GetTransSeat() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the seat index of the object within a transport vehicle.
  description: The GetTransSeat method retrieves the specific seat position occupied
    by a WorldObject (such as a player or creature) on a transport vehicle. This is
    used internally by the TrinityCore server to manage passenger positioning and
    ensure proper interaction with transport systems like boats, zeppelins, or other
    vehicles. The returned value corresponds to the seat index in the transport's
    passenger list, which determines how the object is positioned relative to the
    transport's movement and orientation.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int8 value representing the seat index of the object on a transport
    vehicle. A value of -1 indicates that the object is not currently seated on any
    transport. Valid seat indices typically start from 0 and increment for each additional
    passenger position on the transport.
  examples:
  - title: Check if player is on a transport and get their seat
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nint8 seat = player->GetTransSeat();\nif (seat >=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Player is on a transport, seated in seat 'seat'\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player is seated in transport seat %d\", seat);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is\
      \ not on any transport\n    sLog->outString(\"Player is not on a transport\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on objects that can potentially be passengers
    on a transport vehicle. The return value is meaningful only when the object's
    transport data has been properly initialized and the object is actually mounted
    on a transport.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-negative return value means the object is actively
    moving with the transport; it simply indicates that the object is seated in a
    specific position. Also, this method may return -1 even if the object is on a
    transport if the seat information has not been fully initialized.
