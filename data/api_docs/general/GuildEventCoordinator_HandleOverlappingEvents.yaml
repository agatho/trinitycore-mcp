documentation:
  brief: Handles overlapping guild events by resolving conflicts between two specified
    events.
  description: The HandleOverlappingEvents method is responsible for managing and
    resolving conflicts that occur when two guild events overlap in time or resources.
    This method ensures proper event scheduling and prevents conflicts such as double-booking
    of guild facilities or conflicting event types. It typically checks the overlapping
    conditions and applies appropriate resolution strategies, such as rescheduling
    one of the events or notifying guild members about the conflict. The method is
    part of the GuildEventCoordinator's core functionality for maintaining organized
    and conflict-free guild event management within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId1
    description: The unique identifier of the first guild event that may be overlapping
      with another event.
  - name: eventId2
    description: The unique identifier of the second guild event that may be overlapping
      with the first event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Overlap Resolution
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 event1Id = 1001;

      uint32 event2Id = 1002;

      coordinator.HandleOverlappingEvents(event1Id, event2Id);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the guild event system when a
    new event is scheduled or modified. It may also be invoked during periodic checks
    to identify and resolve existing overlaps in the guild calendar.
  warnings: Improper handling of overlapping events can lead to scheduling conflicts,
    resource misallocation, or incorrect notifications to guild members. Ensure that
    eventId parameters are valid before calling this method.
