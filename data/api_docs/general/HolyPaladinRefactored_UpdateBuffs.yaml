  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void HolyPaladinRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff states and effects for the Holy Paladin instance.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs, auras, and spell effects that are currently applied to the Holy
    Paladin character. This method typically iterates through the paladin's active
    aura list, evaluates their duration and stacking rules, and applies or removes
    buffs as necessary based on game mechanics such as mana regeneration, healing
    bonuses, and defensive enhancements. It ensures that all buff-related statistics
    and visual effects remain synchronized with the current state of the character's
    abilities and spell cooldowns. The method may also handle interactions between
    different buffs, such as stacking limitations or mutual exclusivity rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void HolyPaladinAI::Update()\n{\n    // Other AI logic\n    m_paladin->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Buff Refresh Trigger
    code: "void HolyPaladinRefactored::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spell)\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle spell-specific logic\n    if (spell->HasAttribute(SPELL_ATTR0_CU_AURA_REFRESH))\n\
      \    {\n        UpdateBuffs(); // Force refresh all active buffs\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle or when significant
    state changes occur. It may perform performance-intensive operations such as iterating
    through aura lists and recalculating stat modifiers, so it should be used judiciously
    in time-sensitive contexts.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper cooldowns can lead to
    performance degradation. Ensure that buff updates are not triggered on every game
    tick unless absolutely necessary, as this could cause excessive CPU usage during
    combat or high-traffic scenarios.
