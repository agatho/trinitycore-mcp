  class: ResourceMonitor
  method: GetAverageResourceUsage
  signature: float ResourceMonitor::GetAverageResourceUsage(ResourceType type)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average resource usage for the specified resource
    type.
  description: The GetAverageResourceUsage method computes the average consumption
    of a specific resource type over a defined monitoring period. This method is typically
    used by the ResourceMonitor class to provide performance metrics and resource
    utilization data for various system resources such as CPU, memory, or network
    usage. The returned value represents the average usage percentage or units consumed,
    depending on the resource type being monitored. This functionality is essential
    for server administrators and developers to track system load and optimize performance
    in real-time environments.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: Specifies the ResourceType to calculate average usage for. Valid
      values include CPU, Memory, Network, or other resource types supported by the
      ResourceMonitor class.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the average resource usage for the specified
    resource type. The value typically ranges from 0.0 (no usage) to 1.0 (full utilization),
    though exact scale may vary based on implementation and resource type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float cpuUsage = ResourceMonitor::GetAverageResourceUsage(ResourceType::CPU);

      float memoryUsage = ResourceMonitor::GetAverageResourceUsage(ResourceType::Memory);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Loop
    code: "void MonitorServerResources() {\n    float avgCpu = ResourceMonitor::GetAverageResourceUsage(ResourceType::CPU);\n\
      \    float avgMem = ResourceMonitor::GetAverageResourceUsage(ResourceType::Memory);\n\
      \    \n    if (avgCpu > 0.8f) {\n        // Log high CPU usage\n        sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SERVER,\
      \ \"High CPU usage detected: %.2f%%\", avgCpu * 100);\n    }\n    \n    if (avgMem\
      \ > 0.9f) {\n        // Log high memory usage\n        sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SERVER,\
      \ \"High Memory usage detected: %.2f%%\", avgMem * 100);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may aggregate data over a configurable time window to provide
    meaningful averages. The implementation likely uses internal counters or sampling
    mechanisms to track resource consumption. For accurate results, the ResourceMonitor
    should be actively running and collecting data before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior initialization of the ResourceMonitor
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect values. Ensure that monitoring has
    been started and sufficient data points have been collected for meaningful averages.
