  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::IsProfileActive(const std::string & name)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified adaptive behavior profile is currently active in the
    manager.
  description: The IsProfileActive method determines whether a given adaptive behavior
    profile, identified by its name, is currently active within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
    This functionality is essential for managing dynamic AI behaviors that can be
    enabled or disabled based on game conditions, player actions, or other runtime
    factors. The method performs a lookup in the manager's internal collection of
    active profiles and returns true if the specified profile exists and is marked
    as active, false otherwise. This check is commonly used before applying or modifying
    behavior rules to ensure consistency with the current AI state.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier string of the adaptive behavior profile to
      check for activation status. This should correspond to a valid profile name
      registered with the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
  returns: Returns true if the specified profile is currently active, false if it
    is not active or does not exist in the manager's collection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Profile Activation Check
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;\nif (behaviorManager->IsProfileActive(\"\
      AggressiveCombat\")) {\n    // Perform aggressive combat behavior logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Behavior Execution Based on Profile Status
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = PlayerAI->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();\n\
      if (manager && manager->IsProfileActive(\"NightmareMode\")) {\n    // Apply\
      \ nightmare difficulty settings\n    player->SetDifficulty(DIFFICULTY_MYTHIC);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the active profiles list, so
    performance may degrade with a large number of active profiles. It is recommended
    to cache the result if checking the same profile multiple times within a single
    update cycle.
  warnings: Ensure that the profile name passed to this method exactly matches the
    registered name (case-sensitive), as mismatches will cause the method to return
    false even if the profile exists but under a different identifier.
