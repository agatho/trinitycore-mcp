documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the target character for a complaint ticket
  description: The SetTargetCharacterGuid method assigns a unique identifier (GUID)
    to the character being reported in a complaint ticket. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to associate a specific player character
    with a complaint record, allowing administrators to track and manage player-reported
    issues. The GUID parameter represents the internal database identifier for the
    target character, which must be valid and correspond to an existing player in
    the game world. This method does not perform any validation on the provided GUID
    value and assumes it is correctly formatted.
  parameters:
  - name: targetCharacterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target character being reported
      in the complaint ticket. This should be a valid player GUID from the TrinityCore
      database system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Target Character GUID for Complaint
    code: 'ComplaintTicket* ticket = new ComplaintTicket();

      ticket->SetTargetCharacterGuid(123456);

      // The complaint ticket now references character with GUID 123456'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Target Character GUID from Player Object
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ 789012));\nif (targetPlayer)\n{\n    ticket->SetTargetCharacterGuid(targetPlayer->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly assigns the GUID value without any validation checks.
    It is recommended to verify that the provided GUID corresponds to an existing
    player character before calling this method to avoid potential issues with invalid
    references.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    broken references within the complaint system. Ensure proper validation of the
    GUID value before assignment.
