documentation:
  brief: Resets all combat specialization metrics to their default values.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears and reinitializes all tracking data
    associated with a combat specialization, including damage dealt, healing done,
    and other performance statistics. This method is typically invoked when switching
    between different combat specializations or at the start of a new combat encounter
    to ensure accurate metric collection. The reset operation does not affect the
    specialization's core configuration or settings, only the accumulated metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();

      spec->ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully during combat transitions to avoid
    disrupting ongoing metric tracking. It is recommended to call ResetMetrics before
    starting a new encounter or when switching between different specialization builds.
