  class: VengeanceDemonHunter
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool VengeanceDemonHunter::CanUseAbility(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a Vengeance Demon Hunter can use a specified ability based
    on game state and resource requirements.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a Vengeance Demon Hunter character
    is eligible to cast or activate a specific spell or ability. It checks various
    conditions such as mana cost, cooldown status, player state (e.g., dead, stunned),
    and class-specific restrictions. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    logic to determine valid actions during combat. The method returns true if all
    prerequisites are met and the ability can be used, otherwise false.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability to check. This corresponds
      to the Spell.dbc entry ID in TrinityCore's database.
  returns: Returns true if the Vengeance Demon Hunter can use the specified ability;
    otherwise returns false. This includes checks for resource availability, cooldowns,
    player state, and class restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (vengeanceDH->CanUseAbility(204021)) {\n    // Execute the ability\n\
      \    vengeanceDH->CastSpell(target, 204021);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI Logic
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunter::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (CanUseAbility(204021)\
      \ && !me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING)) {\n        DoCastVictim(204021);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Vengeance Demon Hunter's AI behavior and should
    be called before attempting to cast any spell or ability. It does not perform
    actual casting but only evaluates eligibility. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific subclass of VengeanceDemonHunter being used.
  warnings: Do not assume that a return value of true guarantees successful execution
    of the spell. Additional checks such as line of sight, target validity, and combat
    state should also be performed before casting.
