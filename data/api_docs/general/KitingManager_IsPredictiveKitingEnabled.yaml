  signature: bool KitingManager::IsPredictiveKitingEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether predictive kiting behavior is enabled for the KitingManager
    instance.
  description: The IsPredictiveKitingEnabled method checks if predictive kiting is
    currently active within the KitingManager. Predictive kiting is a feature that
    allows NPCs or players to anticipate target movement and adjust their positioning
    or attack timing accordingly. This functionality enhances combat realism by simulating
    more intelligent AI behavior, particularly in scenarios where targets are mobile.
    The method returns a boolean value indicating the current state of this feature.
    This check is typically used before performing actions that depend on predictive
    kiting being active, such as calculating future positions or adjusting movement
    patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether predictive kiting is enabled (true)
    or disabled (false).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (kitingManager.IsPredictiveKitingEnabled()) {\n    // Perform actions\
      \ that rely on predictive kiting\n    DoPredictiveMovement();\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Fall back to standard movement\n    DoStandardMovement();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a simple getter function and should have minimal performance
    impact. It's recommended to cache the result if checking this value frequently
    in tight loops or performance-critical code paths.
