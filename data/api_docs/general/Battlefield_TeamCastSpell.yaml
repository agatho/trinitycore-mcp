  class: Battlefield
  method: TeamCastSpell
  signature: void Battlefield::TeamCastSpell(int team, int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Casts a spell on all players belonging to the specified team within the battlefield.
  description: The TeamCastSpell method broadcasts a spell effect to all players currently
    active in the battlefield who belong to the specified team. This function is typically
    used during battlefield events or objectives where a spell needs to be applied
    uniformly across all members of a faction. The method does not validate if the
    spell is actually castable or if the players are in a valid state to receive the
    spell effect; it simply triggers the spell application for the entire team. It's
    commonly used for area-of-effect spells, buffs, or debuffs that should affect
    an entire team during battleground combat.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) to which the spell
      will be applied. Must be either 0 or 1.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell to cast on the team members. This should correspond
      to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Cast Healing Spell on Horde Team
    code: battlefield->TeamCastSpell(1, 20543); // Casts Healing Wave on all Horde
      players
    language: cpp
  - title: Apply Aura to Alliance Team
    code: battlefield->TeamCastSpell(0, 12345); // Applies a custom aura to all Alliance
      players
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the battlefield's internal player list and assumes
    that all players in the specified team are currently participating in the battlefield.
    It does not perform any validation of spell usability or player eligibility before
    casting.
  warnings: Using invalid spell IDs may result in undefined behavior or client-side
    errors. Ensure that the spell ID corresponds to an actual spell entry in the database,
    and that the team parameter is either 0 (Alliance) or 1 (Horde).
