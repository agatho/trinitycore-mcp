    & data) const
documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to the provided packet for transmission
    to clients.
  description: The Append method is responsible for populating a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with relevant channel-related information. This method is typically used
    by the Channel system to prepare and send notifications about channel events such
    as join, leave, or moderation actions to connected players. It ensures that the
    appropriate data fields are set according to the channel's current state and the
    type of notification being sent. The method operates on a const object, meaning
    it does not modify the internal state of the ChannelOwnerAppend instance but instead
    reads from it to construct the packet payload.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Channel Event Handling
    code: 'ChannelOwnerAppend owner;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      owner.Append(notifyPacket);

      // notifyPacket is now populated with channel data and can be sent to players'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal channel management system in TrinityCore.
    It assumes that the ChannelOwnerAppend object has valid channel state information
    and that the provided packet is properly initialized for use. The method should
    only be called when preparing to send a notification packet, typically during
    channel operations like player joins or leaves.
