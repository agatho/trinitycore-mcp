  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: QueueForBattleground
  signature: bool AdvancedBehaviorManager::QueueForBattleground(BattlegroundType type)
documentation:
  brief: Queues the player for a battleground of the specified type.
  description: The QueueForBattleground method attempts to add the current player
    to the queue for a specific battleground type. This method is typically used within
    AI behavior scripts or game logic to automatically queue players for competitive
    PvP content. The method will return true if the player was successfully queued,
    or false if the operation failed due to various conditions such as being in a
    group, already queued, or not meeting eligibility requirements. The battleground
    type must be valid and supported by the server configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of battleground to queue for. This parameter specifies which
      battleground template the player should be added to the queue for. Valid values
      are typically defined by the BattlegroundType enumeration, such as BATTLEGROUND_AV,
      BATTLEGROUND_WS, etc.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully queued for the specified battleground
    type; otherwise returns false. The method may return false if the player is already
    queued, in a group that cannot join the battleground, or if the battleground type
    is invalid or unavailable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to queue for a specific battleground
    code: "if (player->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager()->QueueForBattleground(BATTLEGROUND_AV))\n\
      {\n    // Player successfully queued for Alterac Valley\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player queued for Alterac Valley.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to queue player\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Failed to queue player for Alterac Valley.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Queueing based on player's current zone or status
    code: "BattlegroundType bgType = BATTLEGROUND_WS;\nif (player->GetMap()->GetId()\
      \ == 30)\n{\n    bgType = BATTLEGROUND_AV; // Alterac Valley\n}\nelse if (player->GetMap()->GetId()\
      \ == 489)\n{\n    bgType = BATTLEGROUND_EY; // Eye of the Storm\n}\n\nplayer->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager()->QueueForBattleground(bgType);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying battleground queue system and may not
    immediately queue the player if they are in a group or if certain conditions are
    not met. The method does not handle group queuing directly, so players should
    be ungrouped before calling this method if required. Implementation details depend
    on TrinityCore's battleground management system.
  warnings: Calling this method while the player is already queued for another battleground
    may result in a failed operation. Also, attempting to queue for a battleground
    type that is disabled or unsupported by the server configuration will return false
    without any error message.
