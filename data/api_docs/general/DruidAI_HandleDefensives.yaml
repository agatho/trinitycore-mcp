documentation:
  brief: Handles defensive abilities for the Druid AI during combat.
  description: The HandleDefensives method is responsible for managing and executing
    defensive actions for a Druid AI character in combat. It evaluates the current
    combat situation, checks for available defensive spells or abilities, and applies
    them appropriately based on the Druid's current health, mana, and threat level.
    This method typically integrates with the broader AI decision-making system to
    ensure optimal use of defensive cooldowns and abilities such as Barkskin, Survival
    Instincts, or Healing Touch when needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a defensive ability was successfully applied or queued;
    otherwise returns false if no suitable defensive action could be performed or
    if the AI is in an invalid state for defensive actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat loop
    code: "if (druidAI->HandleDefensives()) {\n    // Defensive ability was applied\n\
      \    // Continue with other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the Druid AI's main update loop or
    combat decision-making sequence. It assumes that the AI has access to valid target
    information and sufficient resources (mana, cooldowns) to execute defensive abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the Druid AI object is properly initialized with a valid creature
    and player context before calling this method. Improper usage may lead to incorrect
    behavior or crashes if required data members are not set.
