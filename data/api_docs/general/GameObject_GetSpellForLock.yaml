  signature: const int * GameObject::GetSpellForLock(const int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell associated with a game object's lock, if any.
  description: The GetSpellForLock method retrieves the spell ID that is associated
    with a game object's lock mechanism. This typically occurs when a player interacts
    with a locked object such as a door or chest, and the spell represents the action
    that gets triggered upon successful lock picking or interaction. The method returns
    a pointer to an integer representing the spell ID, which can be used for various
    game mechanics including spell casting, lock picking, or determining whether a
    specific spell is required to interact with the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer representing the spell ID associated with
    the object's lock. If no lock exists or no spell is defined, this value may be
    NULL or zero, indicating no spell is associated with the lock mechanism.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "GameObject* go = player->GetGameObject();\nconst int* spellId = go->GetSpellForLock();\n\
      if (spellId != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use spellId to determine what spell is associated\
      \ with the lock\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with lock-related game mechanics
    and requires proper handling of the returned pointer. The spell ID returned may
    be zero or NULL if no valid lock exists on the object.
  warnings: The method may return NULL or zero if the object does not have a lock
    defined, so developers should always check for null values before using the result.
