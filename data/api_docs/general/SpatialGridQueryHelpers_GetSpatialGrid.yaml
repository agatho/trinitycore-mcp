  signature: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid * SpatialGridQueryHelpers::GetSpatialGrid(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spatial grid associated with a player bot for spatial queries
    and navigation.
  description: The GetSpatialGrid method retrieves a DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid instance
    that represents the spatial grid data structure used by the AI system for pathfinding
    and spatial awareness. This grid contains information about the environment around
    the player bot, including nearby objects, terrain features, and other entities.
    The returned grid is double-buffered to ensure thread safety during concurrent
    access, allowing for safe read operations while updates occur in the background.
    This method is typically used internally by AI systems to perform spatial queries
    such as finding nearby enemies, obstacles, or waypoints.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid object that contains spatial data
    for the specified player bot. Returns nullptr if the bot is invalid or if no spatial
    grid has been initialized for the bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid player pointer\nDoubleBufferedSpatialGrid*\
      \ grid = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::GetSpatialGrid(bot);\nif (grid != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the spatial grid for queries\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Grid for Pathfinding
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nDoubleBufferedSpatialGrid* grid = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::GetSpatialGrid(bot);\n\
      if (grid != nullptr)\n{\n    // Lock the grid for reading\n    auto lockedGrid\
      \ = grid->GetReadLock();\n    // Perform spatial queries or pathfinding operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid returned by this method is designed to be thread-safe.
    The grid may be updated asynchronously while the caller holds a read lock, ensuring
    that spatial data remains consistent during AI processing. This method assumes
    that the bot has been properly initialized with spatial awareness capabilities.
  warnings: Calling this method on a player bot that hasn't been initialized with
    spatial grid data will return nullptr. Always check for null before using the
    returned grid to avoid segmentation faults. Additionally, be aware that accessing
    the grid without proper locking mechanisms can lead to race conditions in multi-threaded
    environments.
