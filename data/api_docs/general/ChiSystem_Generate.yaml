  class: ChiSystem
  method: Generate
  signature: void ChiSystem::Generate(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates chi energy for the player based on the specified amount.
  description: The Generate method is responsible for increasing a player's chi energy
    by the provided amount. This functionality is typically used within the context
    of martial arts or healing abilities in World of Warcraft, particularly for classes
    that utilize chi-based mechanics such as monks. The method updates internal chi
    tracking variables and may trigger visual effects or notifications to the player.
    It does not validate whether the player has sufficient resources or if the generation
    exceeds maximum limits; this is usually handled by calling methods or game logic
    prior to invoking Generate.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of chi energy to generate. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the amount of chi to add to the player's current chi pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Generation
    code: 'ChiSystem* chiSystem = player->GetChiSystem();

      chiSystem->Generate(10); // Adds 10 units of chi to the player''s pool'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Chi Generation
    code: "if (player->HasAura(SPELL_ID_CHI_ENERGY_BOOST)) {\n    ChiSystem* chiSystem\
      \ = player->GetChiSystem();\n    chiSystem->Generate(25); // Generates additional\
      \ chi when aura is active\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal chi state of a player and should
    only be called from within appropriate game logic or ability execution contexts.
    It assumes that the caller has already validated the context in which chi generation
    occurs, such as ensuring the player is not in an invalid state (e.g., dead, stealthed,
    etc.).
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may lead to unexpected behavior
    or exploits. Ensure that chi generation is only performed under controlled conditions
    like during specific abilities, talents, or game events.
