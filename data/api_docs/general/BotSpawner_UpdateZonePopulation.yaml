  class: BotSpawner
  method: UpdateZonePopulation
  signature: void BotSpawner::UpdateZonePopulation(uint32 zoneId, uint32 mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the population count for bots in a specified zone and map.
  description: The UpdateZonePopulation method is responsible for maintaining accurate
    bot population data within a specific zone and map context. This method likely
    adjusts internal counters or data structures that track how many bots are currently
    active or present in the given zone. It may be invoked during zone loading, unloading,
    or periodic updates to ensure that the server's bot management system reflects
    current conditions. The method operates on the zone ID and map ID parameters to
    scope its operation to a specific area of the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier for the zone within the game world. This value
      determines which specific zone's population data will be updated.
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier for the map where the zone is located. This
      helps to further narrow down the scope of the population update to a particular
      map context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner;

      spawner.UpdateZonePopulation(1234, 5678);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the bot management system or during
    zone transition events. It may trigger additional logic such as spawning or despawning
    bots based on current population thresholds.
