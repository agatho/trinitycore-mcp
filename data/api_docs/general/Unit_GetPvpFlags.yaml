documentation:
  brief: Returns the PvP flag state of the unit, indicating whether the unit is in
    a PvP state.
  description: The GetPvpFlags method retrieves the current PvP flag state of a Unit
    object, which determines whether the unit is considered PvP flagged. This state
    is crucial for understanding player behavior in World of Warcraft's PvP mechanics,
    as it affects various gameplay elements including combat interactions, loot eligibility,
    and character status. The method returns a UnitPVPStateFlags enum value that represents
    the current PvP status of the unit, with possible values indicating whether the
    unit is flagged for PvP, unflagged, or in a specific PvP state.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns a UnitPVPStateFlags enum value representing the current PvP flag
    state of the unit. Possible return values include: Unflagged (0), Flagged (1),
    PVP flagged (2), and other specific states depending on the unit''s current status
    in PvP combat.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "UnitPVPStateFlags flags = unit->GetPvpFlags();\nif (flags == UNIT_FLAG_PVP)\
      \ {\n    // Unit is flagged for PvP\n    std::cout << \"Unit is in PvP state\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other PvP-related methods
    to determine the overall PvP status of a unit. It's important to note that this
    method does not directly modify the PvP flag state; it merely returns the current
    state. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple getter method.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combat situations, as incorrect
    handling of PvP flags can lead to unintended consequences in player versus player
    interactions. Also, ensure that the unit being queried is actually a player or
    NPC with valid PvP status.
