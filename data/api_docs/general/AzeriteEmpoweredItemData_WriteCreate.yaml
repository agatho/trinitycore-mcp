  class: AzeriteEmpoweredItemData
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void AzeriteEmpoweredItemData::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, int fieldVisibilityFlags,
    const AzeriteEmpoweredItem * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes Azerite empowered item data to a network packet buffer for client
    synchronization.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state of an AzeriteEmpoweredItemData
    object into a ByteBuffer, which is typically used to send item creation or update
    information to players in the game world. This method handles the serialization
    of Azerite-related fields such as empowered abilities and their levels, ensuring
    that client-side representations are accurately synchronized with server-side
    data. The method respects field visibility flags to determine which data should
    be included based on player permissions or visibility settings. It is commonly
    invoked during item creation, when players acquire new Azerite items, or when
    updating the state of existing Azerite empowered items.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: The ByteBuffer to which the serialized AzeriteEmpoweredItemData will
      be written. This buffer is typically used for constructing network packets sent
      to players.
  - name: fieldVisibilityFlags
    description: Integer flags that control which fields of the AzeriteEmpoweredItemData
      should be included in the serialization. These flags determine visibility based
      on player permissions or game context.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the AzeriteEmpoweredItem object that contains the data
      being serialized. This represents the source item from which the data is extracted.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this data. Used to
      determine visibility and field access based on player-specific permissions or
      context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in item creation
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      AzeriteEmpoweredItemData azeriteData;

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = ...; // Get item reference

      azeriteData.WriteCreate(data, VISIBILITY_FLAG_DEFAULT, item, player);

      // Send ''data'' buffer to player via network'
    language: cpp
  - title: Writing Azerite data with custom visibility
    code: 'ByteBuffer packet;

      AzeriteEmpoweredItemData azeriteData;

      Player* receiver = ...;

      AzeriteEmpoweredItem* owner = ...;

      int visibilityFlags = VISIBILITY_FLAG_OWNER | VISIBILITY_FLAG_PARTY;

      azeriteData.WriteCreate(packet, visibilityFlags, owner, receiver);

      // Send packet to player with limited visibility'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's networking and serialization system
    for Azerite items. It should only be called when preparing data to be sent over
    the network to ensure proper synchronization between server and client states.
    The method assumes that all input parameters are valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the ByteBuffer passed in is large enough to accommodate all
    serialized data; otherwise, it may cause buffer overflows or undefined behavior.
    Also, verify that the owner and receiver pointers are not null before calling
    this method to prevent crashes.
