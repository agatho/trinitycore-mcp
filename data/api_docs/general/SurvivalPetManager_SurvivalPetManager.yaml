  method: SurvivalPetManager
  signature: void SurvivalPetManager::SurvivalPetManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SurvivalPetManager instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The SurvivalPetManager constructor initializes a new instance of the
    SurvivalPetManager class, associating it with a specific player bot. This manager
    is responsible for handling the behavior and management of survival pets in the
    context of AI-driven gameplay. The constructor sets up internal state and references
    needed to control pet actions, combat decisions, and resource management. It prepares
    the manager to integrate with the player's AI system and ensures proper initialization
    before any pet-related operations are performed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be managed
      by this SurvivalPetManager instance. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume player is already created

      SurvivalPetManager petManager(myBot);

      // The pet manager is now initialized and ready to manage the bot''s survival
      pet'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per instance. The Player object
    passed must be a valid, initialized bot player with proper AI systems set up.
    The manager assumes that the player has a valid pet associated with it.
