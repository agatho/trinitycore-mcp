  class: LootDistribution
  method: GetPlayerLootProfile
  signature: PlayerLootProfile LootDistribution::GetPlayerLootProfile(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the loot distribution profile associated with a specific player
    GUID.
  description: The GetPlayerLootProfile method fetches the PlayerLootProfile object
    that contains the loot distribution settings and preferences for a given player.
    This is used internally by the TrinityCore server to manage how loot is distributed
    among players in a group or raid context. The method typically looks up the profile
    in an internal data structure indexed by player GUID, ensuring each player's specific
    loot rules (such as greed, need, or disenchant settings) are respected during
    loot rolling. It is commonly invoked during loot distribution events to determine
    how items should be awarded.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PlayerLootProfile object containing the loot preferences and distribution
    settings for the specified player. Returns an empty or default profile if no specific
    profile exists for the given GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a Player's Loot Profile
    code: 'uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      PlayerLootProfile profile = lootDistribution->GetPlayerLootProfile(playerGuid);

      // Use profile to determine loot distribution behavior for this player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger loot management system and may be
    called frequently during group loot events. It assumes that the player GUID is
    valid and corresponds to an existing player in the database. The returned profile
    object should not be modified directly unless the system supports mutable profiles.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID could
    result in undefined behavior or return a default/empty profile. Ensure proper
    validation of player GUIDs before calling this method if strict error handling
    is required.
