  class: PrioritySpawnRequest
  method: GetAge
  signature: int PrioritySpawnRequest::GetAge() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the age of the priority spawn request in milliseconds.
  description: The GetAge method retrieves the elapsed time since the priority spawn
    request was created. This value represents how long the request has been pending
    in the system, measured in milliseconds. The age is typically used to determine
    request priority, expiration, or for debugging purposes. The method performs no
    side effects and is safe to call at any time during the request's lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the age of the priority spawn request in
    milliseconds. A return value of 0 indicates the request was just created, while
    larger values indicate longer waiting times.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PrioritySpawnRequest* request = new PrioritySpawnRequest();

      int age = request->GetAge();

      printf("Request age: %d ms\n", age);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Age for Priority Logic
    code: "PrioritySpawnRequest* request = GetPendingRequest();\nint age = request->GetAge();\n\
      if (age > 30000) // 30 seconds\n{\n    // Handle stale request\n    ProcessStaleRequest(request);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Process normally\n    ProcessRequest(request);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The age is calculated from the time the PrioritySpawnRequest object was instantiated.
    This method does not account for any delays in processing or system clock adjustments.
    The returned value may be affected by system performance and timing precision.
  warnings: This method returns a raw millisecond count that can grow very large over
    time. Ensure proper handling of potential integer overflow when comparing against
    large values. The age reflects only the time since object creation, not actual
    processing time or network delays.
