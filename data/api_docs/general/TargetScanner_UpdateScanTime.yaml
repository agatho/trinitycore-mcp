documentation:
  brief: Updates the scan time for the target scanner to the current time.
  description: The UpdateScanTime method is responsible for updating the internal
    timestamp of a TargetScanner instance to the provided current time value. This
    method is typically used in AI or targeting systems within TrinityCore to ensure
    that the scanner's last scan operation is properly recorded. It helps maintain
    accurate timing for target detection logic, such as when to re-scan for new targets
    or how long since the last scan occurred. The method does not perform any complex
    operations but simply updates an internal time tracking variable.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_targetScanner)\n \
      \       m_targetScanner->UpdateScanTime(getMSTime());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called during AI update cycles to maintain accurate
    timing for target scanning behaviors. It's important to note that the method does
    not validate the input time value, so developers should ensure that currentTime
    represents a valid millisecond timestamp.
