  method: SendQuestGiverRequestItems
  signature: void PlayerMenu::SendQuestGiverRequestItems(const Quest * quest, int
    npcGUID, bool canComplete, bool autoLaunched)
documentation:
  brief: Sends quest request items dialog to the player for a given quest and NPC.
  description: The SendQuestGiverRequestItems method displays the quest request items
    interface to the player, allowing them to turn in required items for a specific
    quest. This method is typically called when a player interacts with a quest giver
    NPC and has completed the necessary objectives. The dialog shows which items are
    required to complete the quest, and whether the player can immediately complete
    it based on their inventory. It also handles the auto-launch behavior of the quest
    completion process.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that defines the quest being offered.
      Must not be null.
  - name: npcGUID
    description: The GUID of the NPC quest giver. Used to identify which quest giver
      is offering the quest.
  - name: canComplete
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player can complete the quest
      immediately. If true, the quest completion dialog will be shown with a 'Complete'
      button.
  - name: autoLaunched
    description: Boolean flag that determines if the quest should be automatically
      launched without requiring player interaction. When true, the quest may proceed
      directly to completion or reward distribution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendQuestGiverRequestItems
    code: 'PlayerMenu* playerMenu = player->GetPlayerMenu();

      Quest const* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      playerMenu->SendQuestGiverRequestItems(quest, npcGUID, true, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending quest with auto-launch enabled
    code: 'PlayerMenu* playerMenu = player->GetPlayerMenu();

      Quest const* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12346);

      playerMenu->SendQuestGiverRequestItems(quest, npcGUID, true, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest handling system in TrinityCore.
    It relies on proper quest data being loaded in the database and ensures that all
    required items are checked against the player's inventory before displaying the
    request items dialog.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer may lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Also,
    be cautious with the autoLaunched parameter as it bypasses normal user interaction
    flow.
