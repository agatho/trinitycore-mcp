documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a calendar invite by its unique identifier from the calendar manager.
  description: The GetInvite method retrieves a specific CalendarInvite object from
    the CalendarMgr based on the provided invite ID. This method is used internally
    by the TrinityCore calendar system to access individual invites that have been
    created for events. The returned pointer can be used to inspect or modify the
    invite's properties, such as the invite status, invitee information, or associated
    event details. The method performs a lookup in an internal data structure that
    maps invite IDs to CalendarInvite objects, ensuring efficient retrieval of invite
    data without requiring iteration through all invites.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the CalendarInvite object corresponding to the specified invite
    ID, or nullptr if no such invite exists. The returned pointer is valid only as
    long as the invite remains in the calendar system and has not been removed or
    expired.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Invite
    code: "uint64 inviteId = 123456789ULL;\nCalendarInvite* invite = sCalendarMgr->GetInvite(inviteId);\n\
      if (invite)\n{\n    // Process the invite\n    sLog->outString(\"Found invite\
      \ for player: %u\", invite->GetInviteeGuid().GetCounter());\n}\nelse\n{\n  \
      \  sLog->outString(\"No invite found with ID: %llu\", inviteId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the invite ID is valid and corresponds to an existing
    calendar invite in the system. The CalendarMgr maintains internal structures for
    fast lookup of invites by their unique identifiers, making this operation efficient
    with O(1) complexity. Developers should ensure proper null checking when using
    the returned pointer.
  warnings: The returned CalendarInvite pointer becomes invalid if the invite is removed
    from the calendar system or expires. Always verify that the invite still exists
    before using it. This method does not perform any automatic cleanup of expired
    invites, so calling code must handle such cases appropriately.
