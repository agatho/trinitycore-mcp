documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of members in the combat specialization group
  description: The GetGroupMembers method returns the total count of players currently
    assigned to the combat specialization group. This method is typically used within
    the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to manage
    group-based combat specializations, such as those used in raid encounters or battlegrounds
    where specific roles or specializations are required for optimal performance.
    The returned value represents the active member count and does not include any
    offline or inactive players.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of active members in the combat specialization
    group. Returns 0 if the group is empty or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nint\
      \ memberCount = spec->GetGroupMembers();\nif (memberCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with group-based specialization logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Group has %d\
      \ members\", memberCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the combat specialization group is properly initialized
    and maintained by the TrinityCore server. The returned count may vary dynamically
    as players join or leave the group during gameplay.
