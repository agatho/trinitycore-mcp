  signature: void BaselineRotationManager::InitializeEvokerBaseline()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the evoker baseline rotation behavior for the player's current
    specialization.
  description: The InitializeEvokerBaseline method sets up the core rotation logic
    and state management for evoker characters within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method configures the baseline spell priorities, cooldown tracking, and resource
    management systems specific to the evoker class. It ensures that all necessary
    data structures are properly initialized before the combat rotation begins. The
    method typically gets invoked during player login or specialization change events
    to prepare the AI for optimal spell casting decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login Context
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    if (GetSpecialization() == SPEC_EVOKER)\n\
      \    {\n        m_RotationManager->InitializeEvokerBaseline();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the player's specialization and class
    data are fully loaded. It assumes that all necessary evoker-specific resources
    have been allocated in memory.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the player's evoker
    class may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player is actually
    an evoker before invoking this method.
