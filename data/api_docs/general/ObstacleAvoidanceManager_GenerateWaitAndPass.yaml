  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: GenerateWaitAndPass
  signature: AvoidanceManeuver ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GenerateWaitAndPass(const
    CollisionPrediction & collision)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a wait-and-pass avoidance maneuver based on collision prediction
    data.
  description: The GenerateWaitAndPass method computes and returns an AvoidanceManeuver
    object that represents a strategic response to an impending collision. This maneuver
    instructs the AI-controlled unit to temporarily halt movement and then proceed
    in a specific direction once the obstacle is cleared. The method analyzes the
    provided CollisionPrediction data to determine optimal timing and trajectory for
    safe passage. It is typically invoked during pathfinding or movement execution
    when dynamic obstacles are detected in the unit's intended path.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AvoidanceManeuver object that encapsulates the wait-and-pass strategy,
    including timing information and target direction for safe navigation after the
    obstacle is cleared.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager avoidanceManager;

      CollisionPrediction prediction = GetCollisionPrediction();

      AvoidanceManeuver maneuver = avoidanceManager.GenerateWaitAndPass(prediction);

      // Apply the maneuver to unit movement logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's AI pathfinding system and relies on
    accurate collision prediction data. The generated maneuver may be used in conjunction
    with other avoidance strategies for complex obstacle scenarios.
