  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: GenerateThreatResponses
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::GenerateThreatResponses()
documentation:
  brief: Generates threat responses for all units in the threat coordinator's management
    scope.
  description: The GenerateThreatResponses method processes and updates the threat
    state of all units managed by the ThreatCoordinator. It evaluates current combat
    situations, applies threat generation rules based on damage dealt or received,
    and ensures that threat levels are accurately maintained across the battlefield.
    This method is typically invoked during combat updates to maintain proper mob
    targeting behavior and prevent players from exploiting threat mechanics. The method
    does not take any parameters and performs its operations internally using the
    coordinator's stored unit references and threat data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    threatCoordinator.GenerateThreatResponses();\n\
      \    // ... continue with AI updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during active combat scenarios to
    ensure accurate threat management. It is designed to be efficient and thread-safe
    for use in the main game loop. The internal processing may involve iterating through
    all units in the coordinator's scope, so performance can scale with the number
    of active threats.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat contexts unless you are certain
    that threat management is required. Excessive calls during non-combat periods
    may cause unnecessary overhead and could interfere with other systems expecting
    stable threat states.
