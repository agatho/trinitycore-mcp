documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables a specific guild activity for a player
  description: The EnableGuildActivity method controls whether a specified guild activity
    is active for a given player. This functionality allows the game to manage which
    activities (such as guild quests, events, or achievements) are available to players
    within their guild context. The method takes a player's unique identifier, the
    type of guild activity to modify, and a boolean flag indicating whether to enable
    or disable that activity. This is typically used in conjunction with guild management
    systems to dynamically adjust player engagement with guild-related content.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player for whom the guild activity
      state is being modified. This should be a valid player GUID from the TrinityCore
      database.
  - name: activity
    description: The type of guild activity to enable or disable, represented as a
      GuildActivityType enum value. This defines which specific activity (e.g., guild
      quest, raid participation, etc.) is affected by this call.
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean flag that determines the state of the guild activity. If
      true, the activity is enabled; if false, it is disabled for the specified player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable a Guild Quest Activity
    code: GuildIntegration::EnableGuildActivity(123456, GUILD_ACTIVITY_QUEST, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Raid Participation for Player
    code: GuildIntegration::EnableGuildActivity(playerGuid, GUILD_ACTIVITY_RAID, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal player state or database records to reflect
    the new activity status. It may trigger UI updates or event notifications depending
    on how the activity is implemented in the game client.
  warnings: Ensure that playerGuid corresponds to an actual online or existing player,
    as invalid GUIDs might cause undefined behavior or database inconsistencies. The
    GuildActivityType must be a valid enum value; otherwise, the method may silently
    fail or produce unexpected results.
