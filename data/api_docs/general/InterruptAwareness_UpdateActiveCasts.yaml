  brief: Updates the state of active spell casts for the interrupt awareness system
  description: The UpdateActiveCasts method is responsible for maintaining and synchronizing
    the current state of all active spell casts within the interrupt awareness framework.
    This method typically iterates through ongoing cast processes, evaluates their
    interruptibility, and updates internal tracking structures accordingly. It plays
    a crucial role in ensuring that NPCs or players can properly respond to interruption
    events during spell casting, such as when taking damage or being targeted by other
    actions. The method is generally called during game loop updates or specific event
    triggers related to spell casting mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    interruptAwareness.UpdateActiveCasts();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked frequently during the game loop, so performance
    considerations are important. It may involve checking multiple active casts and
    updating their states, which could be computationally intensive if many spells
    are active simultaneously.
