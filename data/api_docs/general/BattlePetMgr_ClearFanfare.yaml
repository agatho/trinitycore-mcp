  method: ClearFanfare
  signature: void BattlePetMgr::ClearFanfare(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the fanfare associated with a battle pet GUID.
  description: The ClearFanfare method removes or resets any fanfare effects that
    are currently active for a specified battle pet identified by its global unique
    identifier (GUID). This method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    Battle Pet system to manage visual and audio feedback when pets are summoned,
    defeated, or undergo other significant events. The operation does not return any
    value and affects only the internal state related to fanfare display for the given
    pet.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet whose fanfare
      should be cleared. This value uniquely identifies a specific battle pet instance
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear Fanfare for a Specific Pet
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetBattlePetMgr();

      uint32 petGuid = 12345;

      petMgr->ClearFanfare(petGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal system managing battle pet visual
    effects and should be called carefully to avoid unintended side effects. It may
    interact with the pet's state machine or UI components, so calling it outside
    appropriate contexts could lead to inconsistent behavior.
