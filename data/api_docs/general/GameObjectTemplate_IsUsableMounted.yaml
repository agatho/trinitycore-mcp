  signature: bool GameObjectTemplate::IsUsableMounted() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the game object can be used while mounted.
  description: The IsUsableMounted method checks if a GameObjectTemplate allows players
    to interact with it while they are mounted on a vehicle or beast. This is typically
    used for game objects like doors, levers, or quest items that may have different
    usability rules depending on the player's mount state. The method evaluates internal
    flags or properties of the GameObject template to determine this behavior. It
    does not consider the actual player's mount status at runtime, but rather the
    object's defined interaction rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the game object can be used while mounted; otherwise returns
    false. This indicates whether the object's usability is not restricted by the
    player's mount state.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a GameObject can be used while mounted
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate && goTemplate->IsUsableMounted()) {\n    // Object can be used\
      \ while mounted\n    printf(\"This object is usable while mounted.\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Object cannot be used while mounted\n    printf(\"This object\
      \ is not usable while mounted.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the GameObjectTemplate's internal flags or data structure
    that defines mount usability rules. It should be called during gameplay logic
    to determine interaction eligibility based on mount state, but does not perform
    runtime checks of whether a player is actually mounted.
  warnings: Do not assume this method accurately reflects real-time mount status;
    it only reflects the template definition. Also, ensure that GameObjectTemplate
    objects are properly initialized before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
