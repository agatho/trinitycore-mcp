  method: operator=

    param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one ManagerRegistry object to another
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy assignment of a ManagerRegistry
    object, transferring all managed resources and state from the source object to
    the target object. This is a fundamental assignment operator that ensures proper
    resource management and prevents shallow copying issues. In the context of TrinityCore's
    architecture, this method likely handles the copying of manager instances or registry
    data structures that manage various subsystems within the game server. The operation
    typically involves releasing existing resources in the target object before copying
    resources from the source.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source ManagerRegistry object to copy from. This parameter represents
      the right-hand side of the assignment expression and contains the data that
      will be copied into the current object.
  returns: A reference to the current ManagerRegistry object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Operation
    code: 'ManagerRegistry registry1;

      ManagerRegistry registry2 = registry1; // Uses operator=

      // or

      ManagerRegistry registry3;

      registry3 = registry1; // Uses operator='
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'ManagerRegistry reg1, reg2, reg3;

      reg1 = reg2 = reg3; // Chained assignment using operator='
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements the rule of three/five pattern for proper
    resource management. The implementation should handle self-assignment correctly
    to prevent memory corruption or undefined behavior. In TrinityCore's context,
    this method may be part of a larger system that manages various game subsystems,
    so careful attention should be paid to thread safety if used in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this operator with objects that manage significant
    resources or have complex internal state. Ensure proper memory management and
    avoid potential issues with self-assignment. If the ManagerRegistry contains pointers
    or handles to external resources, make sure those are properly copied or managed
    during assignment.
