documentation:
  brief: Builds and initializes quest chains for dynamic quest system
  description: The BuildQuestChains method constructs and organizes quest dependencies
    within the dynamic quest system. It processes all available quests in the database,
    identifies prerequisite relationships between quests, and establishes chain structures
    that determine quest progression order. This method is typically called during
    server initialization or when quest data is refreshed to ensure proper quest flow
    and dependency resolution. The method does not require any input parameters and
    modifies internal quest chain data structures for efficient quest retrieval and
    validation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;

      questSystem.BuildQuestChains();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after all quest data has been loaded into
    the system. It performs intensive processing on quest dependencies and may cause
    temporary performance degradation during execution. The method is designed to
    be thread-safe, but concurrent calls to other quest-related methods should be
    avoided during execution.
  warnings: Calling this method while active quests are in progress may result in
    inconsistent quest states. Ensure all quest data is fully loaded before invoking
    this method. Do not call this method from within quest completion handlers as
    it may cause deadlocks.
