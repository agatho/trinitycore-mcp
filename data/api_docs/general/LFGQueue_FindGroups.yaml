  signature: uint8 LFGQueue::FindGroups()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a search for suitable groups within the LFG queue system
  description: The FindGroups method is responsible for scanning the current LFG (Looking
    For Group) queue to identify and match players who are seeking groups based on
    their queued roles, levels, and other criteria. This method typically triggers
    group matching logic that attempts to form parties or raids from players with
    compatible requirements. It operates within the TrinityCore's LFG framework and
    is part of the core matchmaking system for dungeon and raid content. The method
    may update internal state variables and potentially notify players of successful
    matches or continue waiting for more suitable candidates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the number of groups successfully found
    or initiated during this operation. A return value of 0 typically indicates no
    matching groups were found, while higher values suggest multiple groups were created
    or matched.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in LFG queue processing
    code: "uint8 groupsFound = lfgQueue->FindGroups();\nif (groupsFound > 0)\n{\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Successfully formed %u new groups\", groupsFound);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically by the LFG system's internal timer
    or as a result of player actions such as joining or leaving queues. It may have
    performance implications if many players are queued, as it needs to process all
    relevant player data and match criteria.
