  method: ShouldWaitForFormation
  signature: bool FormationManager::ShouldWaitForFormation()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit should wait for its formation before continuing
    with movement or actions.
  description: The ShouldWaitForFormation method checks if a unit in a formation is
    currently required to delay its movement or action execution until it has properly
    aligned with its assigned formation position. This behavior is typically used
    during group movement, combat positioning, or scripted events where units must
    maintain specific spatial relationships. The method evaluates internal formation
    state flags and positioning data to make this determination. It returns true when
    the unit should pause its current activity until formation alignment is achieved,
    and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit should wait for proper formation alignment before
    proceeding with movement or actions; returns false if the unit can continue executing
    its current behavior without waiting for formation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CustomCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_formationManager\
      \ && m_formationManager->ShouldWaitForFormation())\n    {\n        // Do not\
      \ move or attack until formation is ready\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed\
      \ with normal AI behavior\n    DoNormalBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to determine if a
    unit should hold its position. The decision-making process involves checking formation
    leader status, distance from formation point, and alignment requirements. Performance-wise,
    this check is lightweight but may be called frequently during movement.
  warnings: Do not use this method as a standalone condition for movement control
    without considering other AI states. Misusing it could cause units to indefinitely
    wait in place if formation data becomes inconsistent or invalid.
