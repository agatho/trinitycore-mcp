documentation:
  brief: Returns the time when the grid expires and is removed from the map.
  description: The GetGridExpiry method retrieves the timestamp at which a grid cell
    will be removed from the map due to inactivity. This is used internally by TrinityCore
    to manage grid loading and unloading operations, ensuring that inactive grids
    are properly cleared from memory. The method is typically called during grid management
    operations and helps determine when a grid should be unloaded from memory based
    on its last update time.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a time_t value representing the expiration timestamp of the grid.
    This timestamp indicates when the grid will be removed from memory, typically
    after a specified period of inactivity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "time_t expiry = map->GetGridExpiry();\nif (expiry > 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ grid expiration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal grid management system and should not
    be called directly by external code. It's used primarily for determining when
    to unload grids from memory based on their last activity time.
  warnings: This method should not be used for general gameplay logic as it's an internal
    implementation detail. Calling this method may result in undefined behavior if
    the grid is already unloaded or if the map is not properly initialized.
