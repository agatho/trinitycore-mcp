  brief: Appends voice channel notification data to the provided packet for transmission
    to clients.
  description: The Append method is responsible for populating a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with relevant voice channel information. This method is typically used
    within the TrinityCore framework to synchronize voice channel states between the
    server and connected clients. It ensures that client-side voice chat functionality
    reflects the current server state, including channel membership, permissions,
    and other relevant metadata. The method operates on a const object and modifies
    the provided packet in-place without returning any value.
