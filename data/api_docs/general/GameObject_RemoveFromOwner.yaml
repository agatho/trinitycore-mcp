documentation:
  brief: Removes the game object from its owner's data structures and marks it for
    removal from the world.
  description: The RemoveFromOwner method is responsible for dissociating a GameObject
    from its associated owner, typically a player or creature. This method ensures
    that the object is properly unlinked from its owner's internal tracking systems
    and prepares it for either destruction or repositioning. The operation usually
    involves updating ownership references, removing the object from the owner's list
    of summoned creatures or placed game objects, and scheduling the object for removal
    from the world state. This method is commonly invoked when an object needs to
    be destroyed, despawned, or transferred to a different owner.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a spell effect
    code: "void SpellEffectRemoveGameObject(Spell* spell)\n{\n    if (GameObject*\
      \ go = spell->GetExplTarget()->ToGameObject())\n    {\n        go->RemoveFromOwner();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a door object when player leaves area
    code: "void Player::OnAreaLeave(AreaTrigger* trigger)\n{\n    if (GameObject*\
      \ door = GetGameObjectByEntry(12345))\n    {\n        door->RemoveFromOwner();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately destroy the GameObject instance. It only
    removes it from the owner's tracking and prepares it for removal. The actual destruction
    may occur later during the next update cycle or when the object is explicitly
    deleted. This method should be called before any other operations that might depend
    on the object being owned by a valid entity.
  warnings: Calling RemoveFromOwner() on an already removed or destroyed GameObject
    can lead to undefined behavior. Always verify that the GameObject is still valid
    and properly owned before calling this method. Additionally, if the GameObject
    has active AI or scripts, ensure proper cleanup of those systems before removing
    it from the owner.
