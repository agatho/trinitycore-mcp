  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: HandleInitializationFailure
  signature: void BotAIInitializer::HandleInitializationFailure()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the failure case during bot AI initialization by cleaning up resources
    and logging the error.
  description: The HandleInitializationFailure method is invoked when the initialization
    process of a BotAI fails. It ensures proper cleanup of allocated resources, logs
    the failure for debugging purposes, and may trigger fallback mechanisms or notify
    the system about the failed initialization. This method is crucial for maintaining
    system stability and preventing resource leaks in case of initialization errors
    within the bot AI subsystem. The method typically does not take any parameters
    as it operates on internal state that indicates the failure context.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI initialization flow
    code: "void BotAIInitializer::Initialize()\n{\n    if (!SetupBotAI())\n    {\n\
      \        HandleInitializationFailure();\n        return;\n    }\n    // Continue\
      \ with normal initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the BotAIInitializer class
    upon detection of an initialization failure. It's important to ensure that all
    allocated memory or resources are properly released before this method returns,
    as it may be invoked in error recovery paths.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior initialization failure detection may
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect cleanup. It should only be invoked when
    a failure condition has been explicitly identified.
