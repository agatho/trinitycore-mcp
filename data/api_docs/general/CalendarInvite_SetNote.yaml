documentation:
  brief: Sets the note associated with a calendar invite
  description: The SetNote method assigns a textual note to a calendar invite object.
    This note typically represents additional information or comments that a player
    may add when inviting others to an event. The method updates the internal state
    of the CalendarInvite instance with the provided string value. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, calendar invites are used for
    organizing group activities such as raids, dungeons, or social events, and notes
    help provide context or details about the invite. This method does not validate
    the note content beyond basic string assignment.
  parameters:
  - name: note
    description: The string value to set as the note for this calendar invite. This
      can be any valid UTF-8 encoded string, including empty strings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a simple note on a calendar invite
    code: 'CalendarInvite* invite = new CalendarInvite();

      invite->SetNote("Please bring your own food for the raid.");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing an existing note by setting an empty string
    code: 'CalendarInvite* invite = GetPlayer()->GetCalendarInvite(inviteId);

      invite->SetNote(""); // Clears the note'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the CalendarInvite object.
    It is typically used in conjunction with other calendar-related APIs to fully
    construct a calendar event invitation. The implementation likely stores the note
    in an internal member variable without additional processing or validation.
