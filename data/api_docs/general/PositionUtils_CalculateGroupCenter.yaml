  class: PositionUtils
  method: CalculateGroupCenter
  signature: int PositionUtils::CalculateGroupCenter(const int & players)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the center position of a group of players in the World
    of Warcraft world.
  description: The CalculateGroupCenter method determines the geometric center point
    of all active players within a group. This utility function is commonly used for
    positioning mechanics such as grouping NPCs, determining raid formations, or calculating
    spawn points relative to player concentrations. The method processes the current
    player positions and computes an average coordinate that represents the group's
    central location. It assumes that the input parameter 'players' refers to a collection
    or identifier of players in the group, though the exact implementation details
    are inferred from typical TrinityCore usage patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: An integer reference representing the identifier or count of players
      in the group. This value is used internally to locate and retrieve player positions
      for center calculation.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated group center position,
    typically encoded as a unique identifier or coordinate value that can be used
    for further spatial operations within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to calculate group center
    code: 'int groupId = 12345;

      int centerPosition = PositionUtils::CalculateGroupCenter(groupId);

      // Use centerPosition for positioning logic

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger utility system for managing group-based
    spatial calculations in TrinityCore. It may rely on internal player position tracking
    and could be optimized for performance in high-frequency scenarios like raid management
    or dynamic event placement.
  warnings: The method signature suggests that 'players' is passed by reference, which
    implies potential side effects or state changes depending on how the parameter
    is interpreted. Ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded environments.
