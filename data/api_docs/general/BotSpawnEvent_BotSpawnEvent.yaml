  class: BotSpawnEvent
  method: BotSpawnEvent
  signature: void BotSpawnEvent::BotSpawnEvent(BotSpawnEventType eventType)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a bot spawn event with the specified event type.
  description: The BotSpawnEvent constructor initializes a new instance of the BotSpawnEvent
    class, setting up internal state based on the provided event type. This method
    is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to manage bot spawning behavior
    and events. The event type determines how the bot spawn will be processed, including
    whether it's a regular spawn, respawn, or special event-based spawn. This constructor
    likely integrates with the game's event system to trigger appropriate actions
    when bots are spawned into the world.
  parameters:
  - name: eventType
    description: Specifies the type of bot spawn event to initialize. Valid values
      include regular spawn events, respawn events, and special event-based spawns
      that may have different handling logic within the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic BotSpawnEvent Initialization
    code: 'BotSpawnEvent event(BotSpawnEventType::BOT_SPAWN_REGULAR);

      // Initializes a regular bot spawn event'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Respawn Event
    code: 'BotSpawnEvent event(BotSpawnEventType::BOT_SPAWN_RESPAWN);

      // Creates a respawn event for existing bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely sets up internal state variables and may register
    the event with the game's event manager. The actual bot spawning logic is probably
    handled by separate methods in the class or related systems.
