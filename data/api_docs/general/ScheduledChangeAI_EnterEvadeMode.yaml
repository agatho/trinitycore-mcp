  class: ScheduledChangeAI
  method: EnterEvadeMode
  signature: void ScheduledChangeAI::EnterEvadeMode(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Places the AI into evade mode, causing the creature to return to its initial
    position and orientation.
  description: The EnterEvadeMode method is used to trigger the AI's evade behavior,
    which typically occurs when a creature loses its target or becomes unable to continue
    combat. This method causes the AI-controlled creature to stop attacking, reset
    its current target, and return to its original spawn position and facing direction.
    The method is commonly invoked during combat state transitions or when an NPC
    is no longer able to engage enemies due to various conditions such as being stunned,
    feared, or having its target become invalid. This behavior ensures that creatures
    do not remain in combat indefinitely without a valid target.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that may control the evade mode behavior or
      specify the type of evade action to perform. The exact meaning is implementation-specific
      and may vary based on subclass overrides.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Evade Mode Trigger
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_creature->GetHealth()\
      \ < m_creature->GetMaxHealth() / 4)\n    {\n        m_creature->AI()->EnterEvadeMode(0);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Evade Mode with Custom Parameter
    code: "void ScheduledChangeAI::DoEvadeWithReason(int reason)\n{\n    switch (reason)\n\
      \    {\n        case 1:\n            m_creature->AI()->EnterEvadeMode(1);\n\
      \            break;\n        case 2:\n            m_creature->AI()->EnterEvadeMode(2);\n\
      \            break;\n        default:\n            m_creature->AI()->EnterEvadeMode(0);\n\
      \            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method typically resets the AI's current target and movement state. It
    should not be called during combat updates unless necessary, as it may interrupt
    ongoing actions. The parameter value might influence how the evade behavior is
    executed, such as whether to play a specific animation or sound effect.
  warnings: Calling EnterEvadeMode while already in evade mode may cause unexpected
    behavior or infinite loops if not handled properly by subclasses. Ensure that
    target validation occurs before invoking this method to avoid unnecessary evades.
