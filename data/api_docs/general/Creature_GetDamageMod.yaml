  class: Creature
  method: GetDamageMod
  signature: float Creature::GetDamageMod(int classification)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the damage modifier value for a creature based on its classification.
  description: The GetDamageMod method retrieves the damage modifier applied to a
    creature's damage output based on its classification level. This method is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to adjust creature damage calculations
    according to their difficulty or classification. The classification parameter
    typically represents the creature's level or type, such as normal, elite, rare,
    or boss classifications. This function allows developers to modify creature damage
    based on game mechanics and ensures proper balance in combat systems.
  parameters:
  - name: classification
    description: Represents the creature's classification level, which determines
      how damage is modified. Valid values include normal, elite, rare, and boss classifications.
      This parameter affects the multiplier applied to base damage.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the damage modifier multiplier for the
    specified classification. The value typically ranges from 0.0 to 2.0, where 1.0
    represents normal damage, values less than 1.0 represent reduced damage, and values
    greater than 1.0 represent increased damage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float damageMod = creature->GetDamageMod(1); // Returns 1.0f for normal
      classification
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: float damageMod = creature->GetDamageMod(3); // Returns 1.5f for elite classification
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature damage calculation
    methods to determine final damage output. It's important to note that the actual
    damage modifier may vary based on game balance settings and difficulty levels.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as incorrect classification values
    can lead to improper damage calculations, potentially affecting game balance and
    player experience.
