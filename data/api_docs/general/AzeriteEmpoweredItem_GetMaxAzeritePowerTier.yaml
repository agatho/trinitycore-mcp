  signature: int AzeriteEmpoweredItem::GetMaxAzeritePowerTier() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum Azerite power tier available for this empowered item.
  description: The GetMaxAzeritePowerTier method returns the highest tier level of
    Azerite powers that can be applied to the current Azerite empowered item. This
    value determines the upper limit of power progression for the item, which is essential
    for calculating how many Azerite upgrades can be applied and what abilities become
    available at each tier. The returned value typically corresponds to the maximum
    number of Azerite power levels that the item supports, often influenced by the
    item's quality, level, and type within the Azerite system. This method does not
    modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum Azerite power tier for this item. This
    value indicates the highest tier of Azerite powers that can be applied to the
    item, with typical values ranging from 1 to 10 depending on item type and progression.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = player->GetAzeriteEmpoweredItem();

      int maxTier = item->GetMaxAzeritePowerTier();

      TC_LOG_INFO("custom", "Maximum Azerite power tier for item: %d", maxTier);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Tier Against Current Progression
    code: "AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = player->GetAzeriteEmpoweredItem();\nint maxTier\
      \ = item->GetMaxAzeritePowerTier();\nint currentTier = item->GetCurrentAzeritePowerTier();\n\
      if (currentTier < maxTier) {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"custom\", \"Item can still be\
      \ upgraded to tier %d.\", maxTier);\n} else {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"custom\", \"\
      Item has reached maximum Azerite power tier.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Azerite empowerment system introduced in World
    of Warcraft's Legion expansion. The returned value may vary based on item type,
    such as weapons or armor pieces, and can be influenced by factors like item level
    and quality. It is recommended to cache this value if it's accessed frequently
    during gameplay loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the AzeriteEmpoweredItem pointer is valid before calling this
    method, as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. This
    method does not perform any validation on the item's internal state and assumes
    the item is properly initialized.
