  class: ScopedPatternRecording
  method: ScopedPatternRecording
  signature: void ScopedPatternRecording::ScopedPatternRecording(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a scoped pattern recording session for the specified player.
  description: The ScopedPatternRecording constructor initializes a scoped recording
    session for a given player, typically used to track or log specific gameplay patterns
    such as movement, spell usage, or interaction sequences. This mechanism ensures
    that recording is automatically managed within a defined scope, often tied to
    the lifetime of the object instance. The method sets up internal state tracking
    and may register the player with a pattern logging system for subsequent data
    capture.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the pattern recording session
      is being initialized. Must not be null; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in a Game Event Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerEnterCombat(Player* player)\n{\n    ScopedPatternRecording\
      \ recording(player);\n    // Pattern recording begins automatically for this\
      \ player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pattern logging or
    replay systems within TrinityCore. It's recommended to ensure that the Player
    pointer remains valid for the duration of the recording scope.
  warnings: Passing a null player pointer will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate the input before calling this constructor.
