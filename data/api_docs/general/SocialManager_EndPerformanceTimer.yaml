documentation:
  brief: Stops and finalizes the performance timer for social interactions.
  description: The EndPerformanceTimer method terminates an ongoing performance monitoring
    cycle within the SocialManager class. This method is typically invoked after initiating
    a performance timer using a corresponding StartPerformanceTimer call. It records
    the elapsed time and may update internal statistics or log performance data related
    to social system operations such as friend list processing, guild communications,
    or chat message handling. The method ensures that timing measurements are properly
    concluded and resources are released.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      // Assume a timer was started previously

      socialMgr->EndPerformanceTimer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a matching StartPerformanceTimer
    invocation. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior or incorrect timing
    measurements. The implementation likely uses high-resolution timers for accurate
    performance tracking.
