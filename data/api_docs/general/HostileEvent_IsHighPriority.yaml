  method: IsHighPriority
  signature: bool HostileEvent::IsHighPriority() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hostile event is classified as high priority.
  description: The IsHighPriority method checks if a HostileEvent instance has been
    marked with high priority status. This classification typically influences how
    the event is processed within the game's AI and combat systems, potentially affecting
    reaction timing, threat generation, or resource allocation. The method returns
    true if the event meets criteria for high priority, such as involving critical
    targets or imminent threats, and false otherwise. This functionality is integral
    to TrinityCore's hostile encounter management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the hostile event is classified as high
    priority. Returns true if the event has high priority status; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (hostileEvent.IsHighPriority()) {\n    // Handle high priority hostile\
      \ event\n    HandleHighPriorityThreat();\n} else {\n    // Handle normal priority\
      \ hostile event\n    HandleNormalThreat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (m_hostileEvent && m_hostileEvent->IsHighPriority())\
      \ {\n        // Prioritize high priority events in combat logic\n        DoHighPriorityCombatAction();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Execute standard combat behavior\n        DoStandardCombatAction();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal flags or properties set during event
    creation or evaluation. It may be used in conjunction with other priority-based
    systems such as threat calculation, aggro management, or AI decision-making trees.
