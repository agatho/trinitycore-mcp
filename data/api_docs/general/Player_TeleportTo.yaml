  class: Player
  method: TeleportTo
  signature: bool Player::TeleportTo(const TeleportLocation & teleportLocation, TeleportToOptions
    options, uint32 teleportSpellId)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports the player to a specified location with optional spell effects
    and teleportation options.
  description: The TeleportTo method allows players to be moved to a specific location
    within the game world, supporting various teleportation scenarios including custom
    locations, spell-based teleports, and different teleportation options. This method
    handles both immediate and delayed teleportations, and can be used with or without
    a teleportation spell. The method returns true if successful, false otherwise,
    and is commonly used in quest scripts, GM commands, and player movement operations.
  parameters:
  - name: teleportLocation
    description: The target location to teleport the player to, including coordinates,
      map ID, and orientation. This parameter defines where the player will be moved.
  - name: options
    description: Optional flags that control how the teleportation is handled, such
      as whether to use the player's current position or override it with the specified
      location. These options can include flags like 'TeleportToOptions::TeleportNoOrientation'
      or 'TeleportToOptions::TeleportNoUpdate'.
  - name: teleportSpellId
    description: Optional spell ID that will be used to trigger the teleportation
      effect, if applicable. This parameter allows for custom spell-based teleportations,
      such as using a specific teleportation spell or using a default teleportation
      spell.
  returns: Returns true if the teleportation was successful, false otherwise. The
    method may return false if the target location is invalid or if the player cannot
    be teleported due to game restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Teleport Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      TeleportLocation loc;

      loc.mapId = 123;

      loc.x = 100.0f;

      loc.y = 200.0f;

      loc.z = 300.0f;

      loc.orientation = 0.0f;

      bool success = player->TeleportTo(loc, TeleportToOptions::TeleportNoUpdate);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell-Based Teleport Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      TeleportLocation loc;

      loc.mapId = 123;

      loc.x = 100.0f;

      loc.y = 200.0f;

      loc.z = 300.0f;

      loc.orientation = 0.0f;

      bool success = player->TeleportTo(loc, TeleportToOptions::TeleportNoUpdate,
      50000);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other movement methods and
    can be affected by game mechanics like player state or map restrictions. It should
    be used carefully to avoid unintended teleportation behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in players being teleported to
    invalid locations or causing client-side issues. Ensure that the teleportLocation
    is valid before calling this method.
