documentation:
  brief: Retrieves stored data value associated with the specified identifier from
    the conversation AI instance.
  description: The GetData method retrieves a 32-bit unsigned integer value that has
    been previously stored using a corresponding SetData method within the ConversationAI
    class. This method is typically used to access state information or configuration
    values during conversation handling in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
    The retrieved data may represent various conversation-related states such as quest
    progress, NPC dialogue flags, or custom AI parameters. The method does not modify
    any internal state and is safe for repeated calls. It assumes that the data identifier
    corresponds to a valid stored value; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the 32-bit unsigned integer value associated with the specified
    identifier. If no value has been set for the given ID, the return value is undefined
    and may be garbage or zero depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve conversation state
    code: "uint32 questState = conversationAI->GetData(QUEST_STATE_ID);\nif (questState\
      \ == QUEST_STARTED)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest dialogue\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check NPC response flag
    code: "uint32 responseFlag = conversationAI->GetData(NPC_RESPONSE_FLAG);\nswitch\
      \ (responseFlag)\n{\n    case RESPONSE_NORMAL:\n        SendNormalResponse();\n\
      \        break;\n    case RESPONSE_QUEST:\n        SendQuestResponse();\n  \
      \      break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system for handling in-game conversations and
    should only be called when the ConversationAI instance is properly initialized.
    The data identifiers used must match those previously set using SetData to ensure
    meaningful results.
  warnings: Calling GetData with an invalid or unset identifier may return unpredictable
    values. Always verify that data has been set before retrieving it, especially
    in multi-threaded environments where concurrent access could lead to race conditions.
