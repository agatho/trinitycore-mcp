  class: GatheringManager
  method: GetGatheringSpellId
  signature: uint32 GatheringManager::GetGatheringSpellId(GatheringNodeType nodeType,
    uint16 skillLevel) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell ID associated with a specific gathering node type and
    skill level.
  description: The GetGatheringSpellId method returns the unique identifier of the
    spell that is used to gather resources from a particular type of gathering node,
    based on the player's skill level. This method is typically used within the context
    of World of Warcraft's gathering systems such as mining, herbalism, or skinning.
    The returned spell ID corresponds to the actual in-game spell that gets cast when
    a player interacts with a resource node. It ensures that players can only use
    appropriate spells depending on their skill level and the type of node they are
    attempting to gather from.
  parameters:
  - name: nodeType
    description: The type of gathering node (e.g., mining vein, herbalism plant).
      This determines which spell is associated with the resource being gathered.
  - name: skillLevel
    description: The current skill level of the player performing the gathering action.
      Different skill levels may correspond to different spells or abilities for the
      same node type.
  returns: A uint32 representing the spell ID that should be used to gather resources
    from a node of the specified type at the given skill level. Returns 0 if no valid
    spell is found for the provided parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 spellId = gatheringManager.GetGatheringSpellId(GATHERING_NODE_TYPE_MINING,
      150);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using returned spell ID in a spell cast scenario
    code: "uint32 spellId = gatheringManager.GetGatheringSpellId(GATHERING_NODE_TYPE_HERBALISM,\
      \ playerSkillLevel);\nif (spellId != 0)\n{\n    // Cast the spell using the\
      \ retrieved ID\n    player->CastSpell(player, spellId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal mappings or lookup tables that define
    which spell IDs are valid for each node type and skill level combination. It is
    important to ensure that the nodeType and skillLevel values passed in are within
    expected ranges to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Passing invalid nodeType or skillLevel values may result in a return value
    of 0, indicating no matching spell was found. Always validate input parameters
    before calling this method if strict error handling is required.
