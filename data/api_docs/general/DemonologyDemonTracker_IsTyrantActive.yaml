documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the Tyrant demon buff is currently active on the player.
  description: The IsTyrantActive method determines if the player has the Tyrant demon
    buff applied, which is a key mechanic in the Demonology warlock specialization.
    This buff typically provides increased damage or other beneficial effects for
    a limited duration. The method returns true if the buff is active and false otherwise.
    This check is commonly used in spell logic, cooldown management, and damage calculation
    systems within the Demonology class.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Tyrant demon buff is currently active on the player;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (demons->IsTyrantActive()) {\n    // Apply additional damage or effects\n\
      \    damage *= 1.2f;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Logic
    code: "void DemonologyWarlock::HandleTyrantSpell() {\n    if (IsTyrantActive())\
      \ {\n        // Increase spell damage by 20%\n        ApplyDamageMultiplier(1.2f);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks for a specific aura or buff ID associated with
    the Tyrant ability. The implementation may involve checking the player's active
    auras or a dedicated internal flag. This check is performance-sensitive and should
    be used judiciously in frequently called functions.
  warnings: Do not assume this method will return accurate results if called outside
    of proper combat or aura update contexts. The buff state may change rapidly during
    combat, so caching the result for extended periods might lead to stale data.
