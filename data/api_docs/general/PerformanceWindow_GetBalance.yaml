  method: GetBalance
  signature: float PerformanceWindow::GetBalance() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current performance balance value for the window
  description: The GetBalance method retrieves the balance value associated with a
    PerformanceWindow instance. This balance typically represents a metric used to
    measure or control performance-related parameters within the game's system, such
    as resource allocation, efficiency tracking, or load balancing. The returned float
    value is usually normalized or scaled to a specific range depending on the context
    in which the PerformanceWindow is utilized. This method is commonly used in performance
    monitoring systems, resource management logic, or game state evaluation routines
    where maintaining balanced performance metrics is crucial.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the current balance of the performance
    window. The exact meaning and scale of this value depends on the specific implementation
    context, but it typically indicates a normalized performance metric or resource
    allocation level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float balance = performanceWindow.GetBalance();\nif (balance > 0.8f)\n\
      {\n    // Performance is good\n    Log(\"High performance detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorPerformance()\n{\n    float balance = performanceWindow.GetBalance();\n\
      \    if (balance < 0.3f)\n    {\n        // Trigger performance warning\n  \
      \      HandleLowPerformance();\n    }\n    else if (balance > 0.9f)\n    {\n\
      \        // Optimize resource usage\n        OptimizeResources();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically a read-only accessor that does not modify the internal
    state of the PerformanceWindow. The balance value may be updated by other methods
    or system processes, so calling this method multiple times in quick succession
    might return different values. The method is expected to be thread-safe as it
    only reads from internal state.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned balance value for critical decisions
    without considering its context. The meaning of 'high' vs 'low' balance values
    may vary depending on implementation and should be verified against documentation
    or testing. If performance window balancing is tied to game mechanics, changes
    in balance might affect gameplay behavior.
