documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement arbiter configuration with the provided settings
  description: The SetConfig method allows updating the internal configuration of
    a MovementArbiter instance. This method is used to apply new movement-related
    parameters and behaviors to the arbiter, which controls how units navigate through
    the game world. The configuration typically includes movement speed factors, pathfinding
    parameters, and other behavioral settings that influence unit movement patterns.
    This method should be called when runtime adjustments to movement behavior are
    required, such as during dynamic difficulty scaling or specific encounter mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: A constant reference to a MovementArbiterConfig object containing
      the new configuration settings to apply to the arbiter. This includes parameters
      such as movement speed multipliers, pathfinding thresholds, and other movement-related
      behavioral flags.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Update
    code: 'MovementArbiterConfig newConfig;

      newConfig.movementSpeedFactor = 1.5f;

      newConfig.pathfindingRadius = 20.0f;

      unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetMovementArbiter()->SetConfig(newConfig);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Encounter-Specific Movement Settings
    code: 'MovementArbiterConfig encounterConfig;

      encounterConfig.movementSpeedFactor = 0.8f;

      encounterConfig.allowStrafing = false;

      encounterConfig.useSmartPathfinding = true;

      unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetMovementArbiter()->SetConfig(encounterConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the MovementArbiter.
    Changes take effect immediately for subsequent movement operations. The configuration
    object is copied, so modifications to the original after calling this method will
    not affect the arbiter's behavior.
  warnings: Calling SetConfig on an active movement arbiter may interrupt current
    movement paths. Ensure that any ongoing movement operations are properly handled
    before updating the configuration to avoid unexpected behavior or pathfinding
    issues.
