  signature: void WarriorAI::OnCombatStart(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes warrior AI behavior when entering combat with a target unit
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a warrior AI unit begins combat
    with a specified target. This method sets up the initial combat state for the
    warrior, including establishing target tracking, initializing combat abilities,
    and preparing the AI for engagement. The method typically handles the transition
    from idle or patrol states to active combat mode, ensuring that the warrior's
    AI behavior is properly configured for battle. It may also perform necessary setup
    such as caching the target reference, resetting combat timers, or triggering initial
    combat actions based on the warrior's class-specific abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target that initiated
      combat. This parameter cannot be null and must point to a valid unit in the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic combat start handling
    code: "void WarriorAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target)\n    \
      \    return;\n    \n    // Initialize combat state\n    _target = target;\n\
      \    _combatTimer = 0;\n    \n    // Start combat abilities\n    DoZoneInCombat();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the core AI system when a unit enters
    combat. Developers should ensure that target validation is performed before using
    the target pointer. The method may be overridden in custom warrior AI implementations
    to add class-specific behaviors.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is properly validated as non-null before
    accessing its members. Improper handling of the target reference can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior during combat.
