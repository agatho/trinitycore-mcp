  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: SetMaxRange
  signature: void LineOfSightManager::SetMaxRange(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum range for line-of-sight calculations within the LineOfSightManager.
  description: The SetMaxRange method configures the maximum distance at which line-of-sight
    checks will be performed by the LineOfSightManager. This parameter determines
    how far spells, abilities, or other game mechanics will check for obstructions
    between two points. The range value is typically specified in yards and affects
    performance and gameplay behavior. Setting this value too high may impact server
    performance due to increased computational overhead, while setting it too low
    may prevent proper detection of obstructed paths. This method should be called
    during initialization or configuration phases before the manager begins performing
    line-of-sight checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Range for Line-of-Sight Checks
    code: 'LineOfSightManager* losManager = new LineOfSightManager();

      losManager->SetMaxRange(100.0f); // Set maximum range to 100 yards

      // Subsequent line-of-sight checks will not exceed this distance'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Line-of-Sight Manager for Spell Casting
    code: "void ConfigureSpellLOS() {\n    // Configure the LOS manager with appropriate\
      \ range for spell targeting\n    Spell* spell = new Spell();\n    LineOfSightManager*\
      \ los = spell->GetLineOfSightManager();\n    los->SetMaxRange(50.0f); // Adjust\
      \ for specific spell range requirements\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The maximum range setting affects all subsequent line-of-sight calculations
    performed by this manager instance. It's recommended to set this value during
    initialization and avoid frequent changes during active gameplay to prevent performance
    degradation. The actual implementation may clamp values to reasonable bounds based
    on server configuration.
  warnings: Changing the maximum range after the manager has started performing line-of-sight
    checks may lead to inconsistent behavior or undefined results. This method does
    not validate input parameters, so invalid ranges (e.g., negative values) could
    cause unexpected behavior in the underlying system.
