  class: VendorInteraction
  method: UpdateVendorStock
  signature: void VendorInteraction::UpdateVendorStock(uint32 vendorGuid, uint32 itemId,
    int32 stockChange)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the stock quantity of an item offered by a vendor in the game world.
  description: The UpdateVendorStock method adjusts the available inventory count
    for a specific item sold by a vendor. This function is typically invoked when
    items are purchased, restocked, or modified through game mechanics such as quest
    rewards, loot drops, or administrative commands. It ensures that the vendor's
    stock reflects real-time changes in the game world and maintains synchronization
    between client and server data. The method handles both increases and decreases
    in item availability, with appropriate validation to prevent negative stock levels
    where necessary.
  parameters:
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor entity whose stock is
      being updated. This value must correspond to a valid NPC in the game world that
      acts as a merchant.
  - name: itemId
    description: The identifier of the specific item within the vendor's inventory
      that needs its stock adjusted. This corresponds to the ItemTemplate entry in
      the database.
  - name: stockChange
    description: The numeric change to apply to the item's stock count. Positive values
      increase stock, negative values decrease it. Zero results in no change to the
      current stock level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Decrease vendor stock by one item
    code: VendorInteraction::UpdateVendorStock(12345, 67890, -1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Restock a vendor with 10 additional items
    code: VendorInteraction::UpdateVendorStock(54321, 98765, 10);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal updates to the vendor's inventory database
    records and may broadcast changes to connected clients. Developers should ensure
    that all stock modifications are properly validated before calling this function
    to avoid inconsistencies in the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative stock change that would result in
    a negative total stock count might lead to undefined behavior or client-side display
    issues if not handled by underlying validation logic.
