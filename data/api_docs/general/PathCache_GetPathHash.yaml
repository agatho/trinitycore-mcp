  method: GetPathHash
  signature: uint64_t PathCache::GetPathHash(const int & src, const int & dest) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a unique hash value for a path between two given nodes
    in the navigation mesh.
  description: The GetPathHash method computes a deterministic 64-bit hash identifier
    based on the source and destination node indices provided. This hash is used internally
    by the PathCache to uniquely identify and retrieve cached navigation paths. The
    method ensures that identical paths between the same source and destination will
    always produce the same hash value, enabling efficient caching and lookup operations.
    It is commonly used in pathfinding systems where performance and consistency are
    critical for smooth gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: src
    description: The index of the starting node in the navigation mesh. Must be a
      valid node identifier within the current map's pathfinding system.
  - name: dest
    description: The index of the destination node in the navigation mesh. Must be
      a valid node identifier within the current map's pathfinding system.
  returns: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique hash of the path from
    source to destination. This value can be used as a key for caching or identifying
    specific paths in the PathCache.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint64_t pathHash = pathCache->GetPathHash(100, 200);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Hash for Cache Lookup
    code: "uint64_t hash = pathCache->GetPathHash(sourceNode, destNode);\nif (pathCache->HasCachedPath(hash))\
      \ {\n    // Retrieve cached path\n    Path* cachedPath = pathCache->GetCachedPath(hash);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided node indices are valid and exist within
    the current navigation mesh. Invalid or out-of-bounds node indices may lead to
    undefined behavior. The hash calculation is deterministic, meaning identical source/destination
    pairs will always produce the same result across different calls.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'src' and 'dest' parameters refer to nodes that are part
    of the same map's navigation mesh; otherwise, the resulting hash may not be meaningful
    for pathfinding operations. Do not use this method with invalid node indices without
    proper validation.
