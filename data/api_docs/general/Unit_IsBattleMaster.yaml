  signature: bool Unit::IsBattleMaster() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is a battle master.
  description: This method checks if the Unit object represents a battle master, which
    is a type of NPC that offers battleground services in World of Warcraft. The function
    returns true when the unit is specifically a battle master and false otherwise.
    This functionality is commonly used to identify NPCs who provide battleground
    services such as arena team registration, battleground entry, and other related
    activities. The method is part of the general unit classification system and can
    be used in conjunction with other unit-related methods to determine NPC type and
    behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is a battle master, false otherwise. This indicates
    that the object represents an NPC who offers battleground services.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsBattleMaster()) {\n    // Handle battle master specific behavior\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (target && target->IsBattleMaster())\
      \ {\n    // Perform actions specific to battle masters\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation relies on internal unit classification logic. This method
    may be used in conjunction with other methods like IsGossip and IsQuestgiver to
    determine NPC types. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a simple
    boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with IsBattlefieldMaster or similar
    methods which might have different functionality. The method does not check for
    specific battleground types or conditions, only the general battle master classification.
