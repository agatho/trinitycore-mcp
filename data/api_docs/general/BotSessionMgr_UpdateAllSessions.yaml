  method: UpdateAllSessions
  signature: void BotSessionMgr::UpdateAllSessions(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active bot sessions with the specified time difference.
  description: The UpdateAllSessions method iterates through all currently active
    bot sessions managed by the BotSessionMgr and performs necessary updates based
    on the elapsed time difference provided. This typically includes processing AI
    behaviors, handling session timeouts, updating bot states, and managing resource
    allocation for each active session. The method is designed to be called regularly
    from the game loop to ensure that all bot behaviors remain synchronized with the
    passage of time. It serves as a central coordination point for maintaining the
    state and activity of multiple bot sessions simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    botSessionMgr->UpdateAllSessions(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with World Update Cycle
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other world updates ...\n\
      \    botSessionMgr->UpdateAllSessions(diff);\n    // ... more world updates\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game update loop and should
    be invoked with the time difference (in milliseconds) since the last call. The
    implementation likely uses a timer-based approach to manage session expiration
    and AI processing intervals. Performance considerations include avoiding heavy
    computations within this method as it may be called frequently.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or zero time differences, as this
    could lead to incorrect session state updates. Ensure that the BotSessionMgr instance
    is properly initialized before calling this method.
