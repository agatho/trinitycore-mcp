api:
  class: Map
  method: GetObjectsStore
  signature: int & Map::GetObjectsStore()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the object store identifier for the map.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier associated with the object
    store of a Map instance, which is used to distinguish different object stores
    within the game world. The returned value represents the internal ID used by TrinityCore's
    object management system to track and categorize various objects in the map. This
    identifier is essential for maintaining proper object referencing and ensuring
    correct gameplay mechanics when dealing with different map instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer reference representing the object store identifier of
    the map, which is used internally by TrinityCore to distinguish between different
    object stores in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int& storeId = map->GetObjectsStore();

      // Use storeId for object management purposes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related methods
    to manage object references within the game world. The returned value should be
    treated as an internal identifier and not modified directly.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect object referencing or
    memory corruption if used inappropriately. This method should only be used when
    working with internal TrinityCore object management systems.
