  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: ResetAdapterStats
  signature: void BotSpawnerAdapter::ResetAdapterStats()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all statistics and counters within the BotSpawnerAdapter instance
    to their initial state.
  description: The ResetAdapterStats method clears all internal tracking data, counters,
    and statistical information maintained by the BotSpawnerAdapter. This includes
    resetting spawn counts, failure metrics, and any other performance or usage statistics
    that have been accumulated since the adapter was initialized or last reset. The
    method is typically invoked when a clean state is required for testing, debugging,
    or after significant changes to bot spawning configurations. It ensures that subsequent
    operations start with a known baseline, preventing carryover of outdated metrics
    that could affect behavior or reporting.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter adapter;

      // ... perform some bot spawning operations ...

      adapter.ResetAdapterStats(); // Reset all statistics'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before Testing
    code: "void TestBotSpawning()\n{\n    BotSpawnerAdapter adapter;\n    // Configure\
      \ and run tests\n    adapter.ResetAdapterStats();\n    // Run fresh test with\
      \ clean metrics\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in production environments where statistics
    are being monitored, as it will erase all accumulated data. It is primarily intended
    for development and testing scenarios.
