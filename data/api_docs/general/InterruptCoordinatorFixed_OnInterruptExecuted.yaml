  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: OnInterruptExecuted
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::OnInterruptExecuted(int botGuid, int
    targetGuid, uint32 spellId, bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the interrupt coordinator that an interrupt attempt has been executed,
    updating internal state based on execution result.
  description: The OnInterruptExecuted method is invoked when an interrupt action
    (such as a spell or ability) has been attempted and completed. It updates the
    internal tracking state of the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class to reflect whether
    the interrupt was successful or not. This method plays a critical role in managing
    interrupt cooldowns, success rates, and state transitions within the AI behavior
    system of TrinityCore's bot framework. The method does not perform any direct
    game logic but serves as a callback to maintain consistency between the bot's
    interrupt actions and its internal decision-making process.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that attempted the interrupt.
      Used to track which entity performed the action.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the target that was interrupted. Helps
      identify the context of the interrupt attempt.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell or ability used for the interrupt. Allows differentiation
      between various interrupt types and their effects.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the interrupt was successful (true)
      or failed (false). Determines subsequent behavior in the interrupt coordinator.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.OnInterruptExecuted(12345, 67890, 1234, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Interrupt Failure
    code: "if (!bot->TryInterrupt(target, spellId)) {\n    coordinator.OnInterruptExecuted(botGuid,\
      \ targetGuid, spellId, false);\n} else {\n    coordinator.OnInterruptExecuted(botGuid,\
      \ targetGuid, spellId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within bot AI logic or interrupt handling
    systems. It assumes that the GUIDs and spell ID are valid and have been previously
    verified. The internal state of the coordinator may be updated asynchronously
    depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are validated before calling this method to
    prevent incorrect tracking of interrupt attempts. Improper use could lead to inconsistent
    behavior in AI decision-making or incorrect cooldown management.
