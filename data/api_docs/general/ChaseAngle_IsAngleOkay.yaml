  class: ChaseAngle
  method: IsAngleOkay
  signature: bool ChaseAngle::IsAngleOkay(float relativeAngle) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given relative angle falls within the acceptable range
    for chase behavior.
  description: The IsAngleOkay method evaluates whether a specified relative angle
    is within the valid angular range that allows a creature or unit to continue its
    chase movement. This method is typically used in AI logic to ensure that a chasing
    unit maintains proper orientation toward its target, preventing unnecessary turning
    or erratic movement patterns. The acceptable angle range is defined by internal
    parameters of the ChaseAngle class, which may vary based on the specific implementation
    and context of the chasing behavior. This method does not modify any state and
    serves purely as a validation check for angular alignment during chase operations.
  parameters:
  - name: relativeAngle
    description: The relative angle in radians to evaluate against the acceptable
      range. Positive values indicate clockwise rotation from the forward direction,
      while negative values indicate counter-clockwise rotation.
  returns: Returns true if the provided relative angle is within the valid angular
    range for chase behavior; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Angle Validation
    code: "ChaseAngle chaseAngle;\nfloat testAngle = 0.5f; // 0.5 radians\nbool isValid\
      \ = chaseAngle.IsAngleOkay(testAngle);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with\
      \ chase movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Movement Logic
    code: "void UpdateChaseBehavior(Unit* target)\n{\n    float angleToTarget = GetRelativeAngle(target);\n\
      \    if (!chaseAngle.IsAngleOkay(angleToTarget))\n    {\n        // Adjust orientation\
      \ or stop chase\n        StopChasing();\n        return;\n    }\n    // Continue\
      \ normal chase behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: "This method assumes that the relative angle is normalized to a range suitable\
    \ for comparison, typically between -\u03C0 and \u03C0 radians. The internal threshold\
    \ values defining the acceptable angular range are likely configurable based on\
    \ creature type or AI difficulty settings."
  warnings: Ensure that the input angle is properly normalized before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior. Improperly normalized angles may lead to
    incorrect validation results, especially near boundary conditions.
