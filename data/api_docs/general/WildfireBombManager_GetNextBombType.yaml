documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the next bomb type to be deployed by the wildfire
    bomb manager.
  description: The GetNextBombType method is responsible for calculating and returning
    the type of bomb that will be deployed next in a wildfire bomb sequence. This
    method likely implements logic to cycle through different bomb types, possibly
    based on game state, difficulty settings, or procedural randomness. The returned
    BombType enum value indicates which specific type of wildfire bomb should be created
    and activated. This method is typically called during the initialization or activation
    phase of a wildfire bomb system within the game's AI or spell mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a BombType enumeration value representing the type of bomb that
    will be deployed next. The specific values depend on the BombType enum definition,
    which likely includes types such as RegularBomb, ExplosiveBomb, or other specialized
    wildfire bomb variants.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "void WildfireAI::Update()\n{\n    BombType nextBomb = m_bombManager.GetNextBombType();\n\
      \    switch (nextBomb)\n    {\n        case BOMB_TYPE_REGULAR:\n           \
      \ // Spawn regular wildfire bomb\n            break;\n        case BOMB_TYPE_EXPLOSIVE:\n\
      \            // Spawn explosive wildfire bomb\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during active wildfire bomb sequences
    and should be optimized for performance. The implementation may involve state
    tracking or random number generation, so it's important to ensure thread safety
    if used in concurrent contexts.
