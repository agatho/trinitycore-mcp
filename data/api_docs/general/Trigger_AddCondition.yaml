  method: AddCondition
  signature: void Trigger::AddCondition(std::function<bool (BotAI *)> condition)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a condition function to the trigger that determines when the trigger
    should activate.
  description: The AddCondition method allows developers to register a condition function
    with a Trigger object. This condition function is evaluated each time the trigger
    checks if it should activate. The function takes a BotAI pointer as input and
    returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is met. When the condition
    returns true, the trigger's associated actions may be executed. This mechanism
    enables dynamic and context-sensitive triggering of AI behaviors in the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: condition
    description: A std::function object that accepts a BotAI* parameter and returns
      bool. The function should evaluate whether certain conditions are met for the
      trigger to activate.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Condition Addition
    code: "trigger->AddCondition([](BotAI* ai) {\n    return ai->GetHealthPercent()\
      \ < 30;\n});"
    language: cpp
  - title: Complex Condition with Multiple Checks
    code: "trigger->AddCondition([=](BotAI* ai) {\n    return ai->GetTarget() != nullptr\
      \ &&\n           ai->GetTarget()->IsInCombat() &&\n           ai->GetDistanceTo(ai->GetTarget())\
      \ < 10.0f;\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: The condition function is called during the trigger's evaluation cycle, typically
    in the AI update loop. It's important to ensure that the condition logic is efficient
    as it may be called frequently. The BotAI pointer passed to the condition function
    is guaranteed to be valid during execution.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations within the
    condition function as this can impact AI performance. Ensure thread safety if
    the condition accesses shared data structures, though typically these are evaluated
    in the main game thread.
