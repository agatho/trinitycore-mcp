documentation:
  brief: Applies spell penetration bonus to the player's spell damage.
  description: This method modifies the player's spell penetration value by applying
    or removing a specified bonus amount. Spell penetration reduces the effectiveness
    of enemy spell resistance, allowing spells to penetrate more effectively. The
    method is typically used during spell casting or when applying buffs/debuffs to
    adjust the player's spell penetration stat. It affects both direct and periodic
    spell damage calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The spell penetration bonus value to apply or remove. Positive values
      increase penetration, negative values decrease it.
  - name: apply
    description: If true, applies the bonus; if false, removes it. This determines
      whether the bonus is added or subtracted from current spell penetration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Spell Penetration Bonus
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->ApplySpellPenetrationBonus(50, true);

      // This increases the player''s spell penetration by 50'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Spell Penetration Bonus
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->ApplySpellPenetrationBonus(-30, false);

      // This decreases the player''s spell penetration by 30'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when modifying spell penetration values during
    gameplay. It may affect spell calculations and should be used carefully to avoid
    unintended consequences in combat.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell damage calculations
    or unexpected behavior in combat. Ensure that the bonus value is properly applied
    or removed before any spell effects are calculated.
