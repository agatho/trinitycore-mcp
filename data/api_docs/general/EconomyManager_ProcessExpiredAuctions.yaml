  class: EconomyManager
  method: ProcessExpiredAuctions
  signature: void EconomyManager::ProcessExpiredAuctions()
documentation:
  brief: Processes all expired auctions in the economy system, handling refunds and
    cleanup.
  description: The ProcessExpiredAuctions method iterates through all currently active
    auctions that have reached their expiration time and performs necessary cleanup
    operations. This includes returning the auctioned item to the original owner,
    refunding the bid amount (if applicable), and removing the auction record from
    the database. The method ensures proper handling of auction expiration mechanics
    within the TrinityCore economy system, maintaining data integrity and player balance.
    It is typically invoked by the game's economy manager at regular intervals or
    during server maintenance cycles.

    code: 'EconomyManager* econMgr = sEconomyManager;

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to maintain proper auction house functionality.
    It may involve database operations and could impact performance during high-traffic
    periods. The method is designed to be thread-safe as it operates on a dedicated
    economy manager instance.
  warnings: Calling this method manually outside of normal game flow may cause inconsistencies
    in auction data. Ensure that all related auction transactions are properly synchronized
    before invoking this function.
