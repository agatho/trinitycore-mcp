  class: TradeSystem
  method: UpdateTradeSession
  signature: void TradeSystem::UpdateTradeSession(uint32 sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of a trade session identified by the given session ID.
  description: The UpdateTradeSession method is responsible for processing and updating
    the state of an active trade session within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    typically handles synchronization of trade data between two players, including
    item updates, gold amounts, and trade status changes. It ensures that both parties
    in a trade have consistent views of the current trade state and manages any necessary
    validation or conflict resolution. The method is usually invoked during trade
    interactions to maintain synchronization between client and server states.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier for the trade session to be updated. This ID
      typically corresponds to a specific trade interaction between two players and
      is used to locate and process the relevant trade data within the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Session Update
    code: TradeSystem::UpdateTradeSession(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Trade Sessions
    code: "for (uint32 sessionId : activeTradeSessions)\n{\n    TradeSystem::UpdateTradeSession(sessionId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation to ensure the session exists
    and is in a valid state before processing. It may also handle serialization of
    trade data to maintain consistency across the network. The implementation should
    be thread-safe as multiple players might be updating their trade sessions simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent session ID could result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the sessionId parameter refers to
    a currently active trade session before invoking this method.
