  signature: Player * Battleground::_GetPlayerForTeam(int team, int itr, const char

documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a player object from a specified team and iteration index within
    the battleground.
  description: The _GetPlayerForTeam method is used internally by the Battleground
    class to retrieve a specific Player object based on the team and an iterator index.
    This method is typically employed during battleground operations such as player
    assignment, scoring, or status checks. It allows access to players participating
    in a particular team (e.g., Alliance or Horde) at a given position within that
    team's list of participants. The method requires valid team and iteration parameters;
    otherwise, it may return a null pointer. This function is part of the internal
    API and should not be called directly by external code.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier (typically 0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) to specify
      which team's player list to query.
  - name: itr
    description: The zero-based index within the specified team's list of players.
      Must be a valid index; otherwise, returns nullptr.
  - name: context
    description: A string identifier used for debugging or logging purposes to indicate
      where this method was called from.
  returns: A pointer to the Player object if a valid player exists at the specified
    team and index; otherwise, returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground logic
    code: "Player* player = bg->_GetPlayerForTeam(0, 2, \"CheckPlayerPosition\");\n\
      if (player)\n{\n    // Process player data\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating through all players on a team
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < bg->GetMaxPlayersPerTeam(); ++i)\n{\n    Player* player\
      \ = bg->_GetPlayerForTeam(1, i, \"IterateHorde\");\n    if (player)\n    {\n\
      \        // Perform actions with each Horde player\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use within the Battleground class. It
    assumes that team and index values are valid, and does not perform bounds checking
    beyond basic sanity checks. Calling this method outside of battleground context
    may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you're implementing or extending
    battleground logic. Incorrect usage with invalid indices or teams can cause crashes
    or memory access violations.
