  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: MarketAnalysis
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::MarketAnalysis()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the market analysis system for tracking and evaluating in-game
    economic data.
  description: The MarketAnalysis constructor initializes the market analysis framework
    within TrinityCore, setting up internal structures for monitoring item prices,
    auction house activity, and player trading behaviors. This method prepares the
    system to collect and process economic data from various sources including auctions,
    vendor transactions, and player interactions. The initialization includes allocating
    memory for data storage, registering event handlers for relevant game events,
    and preparing statistical analysis modules. No preconditions are required as this
    is a constructor method, but it should be called during server startup or when
    the market analysis module is first needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analyzer;

      // Constructor automatically initializes the market analysis system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once during server initialization.
    The system relies on various TrinityCore event handlers to populate data, so proper
    server startup order is essential for accurate market analysis.
