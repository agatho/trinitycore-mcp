  class: Spell
  method: ExecuteLogEffectUnsummonObject
  signature: void Spell::ExecuteLogEffectUnsummonObject(int effect, WorldObject *
    obj)
documentation:
  brief: Unsummons an object as part of a spell effect log.
  description: This method handles the unsummoning of objects during spell effect
    execution, specifically when a spell's effect requires the removal of summoned
    objects from the game world. It is typically invoked during spell processing to
    ensure proper cleanup of summoned creatures or GameObjects that are no longer
    needed. The method operates on the provided WorldObject, which could be either
    a creature or GameObject, and removes it from the game world through appropriate
    mechanisms such as despawning or removing from the map. This behavior is essential
    for maintaining game balance and preventing object accumulation in the world.
  parameters:
  - name: effect
    description: The effect index that triggered this unsummoning action. This parameter
      determines which specific effect within the spell's effect list is being processed,
      and helps identify the correct behavior for the unsummoning operation.
  - name: obj
    description: The WorldObject to be unsummoned. This parameter represents either
      a creature or GameObject that has been summoned as part of the spell's effects.
      The object is removed from the game world and its associated data is cleaned
      up.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::ExecuteLogEffectUnsummonObject(int effect, WorldObject * obj)\n\
      {\n    // Implementation logic\n    if (obj)\n    {\n        obj->RemoveFromWorld();\n\
      \        obj->SetOwner(nullptr);\n    }\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell effect handling system and should be called
    during spell execution when a summoned object needs to be removed. It is typically
    invoked from within the Spell::EffectUnsummon method or similar functions, and
    is not meant to be directly called by external code unless explicitly required
    by game mechanics.
  warnings: This method should not be called on objects that are already removed from
    the world, as doing so may lead to memory access violations or crashes. Care must
    be taken to ensure the object is valid before calling this method.
