documentation:
  brief: Checks if a combat specialization interrupt ability is ready to be used.
  description: The IsInterruptReady method determines whether a player's combat specialization
    interrupt ability (such as a spell or ability that interrupts enemy casts) is
    currently available for use. This check typically evaluates cooldown status, resource
    requirements, and other game state conditions necessary for the interrupt to be
    executable. The method returns true if all prerequisites are met and the interrupt
    can be cast immediately, otherwise false. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this is commonly used in combat logic to conditionally execute interrupt abilities
    based on current readiness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat specialization interrupt ability is ready for
    use, false otherwise. This indicates that all cooldowns, resource costs, and other
    preconditions have been satisfied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->IsInterruptReady())\n{\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ INTERRUPT_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interrupt Application
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nif (target && target->IsNonMeleeSpellCast())\n\
      {\n    if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->IsInterruptReady())\n    {\n \
      \       player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_INTERRUPT, true);\n        // Reset\
      \ interrupt cooldown\n        player->GetCombatSpecialization()->SetInterruptCooldown();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat state checks
    and should be called before attempting to cast an interrupt spell. The readiness
    check may involve cooldown timers, mana/resource levels, and target validity conditions
    specific to the specialization's interrupt ability.
  warnings: Ensure that the player has a valid combat specialization assigned before
    calling this method, as it might not behave correctly on units without proper
    specialization data. Also, be aware that some interrupt abilities have additional
    restrictions beyond simple readiness checks such as line of sight or target type
    requirements.
