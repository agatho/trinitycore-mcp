  method: ResetMetrics
  signature: void PathfindingManager::ResetMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all pathfinding performance metrics and statistics to their initial
    state.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated performance data and
    statistics tracked by the PathfindingManager. This includes reseting counters,
    timers, and any other metric-related variables that have been collected during
    pathfinding operations. The method is typically called to provide clean baseline
    measurements for performance analysis or to reset internal tracking after a specific
    period of operation. It ensures that subsequent metrics reflect only the activity
    occurring after the reset, making it useful for monitoring and debugging pathfinding
    behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathfindingManager* manager = sObjectMgr->GetPathfindingManager();

      manager->ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Reset
    code: "void ResetAndLogPathfindingStats()\n{\n    PathfindingManager* manager\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetPathfindingManager();\n    manager->ResetMetrics();\n   \
      \ // Additional logging or reporting code here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may temporarily affect ongoing pathfinding operations. The reset operation
    is atomic and thread-safe, but calling it during active pathfinding may cause
    temporary inconsistencies in real-time metrics.
  warnings: Calling ResetMetrics while pathfinding operations are actively running
    may lead to inconsistent metric reporting until the next measurement cycle. Avoid
    frequent resets in production environments without proper monitoring.
