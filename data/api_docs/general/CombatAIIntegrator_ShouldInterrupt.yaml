  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: ShouldInterrupt
  signature: bool CombatAIIntegrator::ShouldInterrupt()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat AI should interrupt the current spell cast.
  description: The ShouldInterrupt method evaluates if the current spell casting should
    be interrupted based on various combat conditions and AI logic. This method is
    typically called during combat to assess whether an interruptible spell should
    be canceled, such as when a target becomes unattackable or when specific interrupt
    conditions are met. It integrates with the overall combat decision-making process
    of the AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current spell cast should be interrupted; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI logic
    code: "if (combatAIIntegrator.ShouldInterrupt()) {\n    // Cancel current spell\
      \ cast\n    unit->CastStop();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CombatAIIntegrator class and is expected to be
    called regularly during combat updates. The decision logic may depend on target
    state, spell properties, and AI configuration.
