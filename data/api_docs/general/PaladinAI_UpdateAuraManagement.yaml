  brief: Manages aura application and removal for paladin AI behavior.
  description: The UpdateAuraManagement method is responsible for handling the application,
    updating, and removal of auras specific to paladin class abilities within the
    AI system. This method evaluates the current state of the paladin's target and
    self, determines which auras should be applied or removed based on combat conditions,
    and manages the cooldowns and requirements for aura usage. It integrates with
    the paladin's spell casting logic to ensure proper buff and debuff management
    during combat encounters.

    code: "void UpdateAuraManagement()\n{\n    // Called every AI update cycle\n \
      \   if (me->GetVictim())\n    {\n        // Apply appropriate auras based on\
      \ target state\n        ApplyBlessingOfMight();\n        ApplySealOfRighteousness();\n\
      \    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually. It relies on the paladin's current target state, spell cooldowns,
    and resource availability to make decisions about aura management.
