  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordAsyncCallback
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordAsyncCallback(uint64 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records an asynchronous callback duration in microseconds for performance
    monitoring.
  description: The RecordAsyncCallback method logs the execution time of an asynchronous
    operation within the bot performance monitoring system. This method is typically
    invoked after an async task completes to track how long it took, enabling developers
    to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize bot behavior. The recorded data
    contributes to overall performance metrics used for debugging and improving AI
    responsiveness in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The duration of the asynchronous callback execution in microseconds.
      This value should be a positive integer representing the time elapsed since
      the start of the async operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      // Simulate an async operation

      uint64 duration = 1500; // 1.5 milliseconds

      monitor.RecordAsyncCallback(duration);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Async Task Completion
    code: "void MyBot::OnAsyncTaskComplete()\n{\n    uint64 endTime = getTickCount();\n\
      \    uint64 startTime = asyncTaskStartTime;\n    uint64 duration = endTime -\
      \ startTime;\n    performanceMonitor.RecordAsyncCallback(duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not block execution.
    It's recommended to call this method immediately after an async operation finishes
    to maintain accurate timing data.
