documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a vehicle seat allows passengers to be ejected.
  description: The IsEjectable method checks if a specific vehicle seat entry permits
    the ejection of its passenger. This is typically used in vehicle-related game
    mechanics to control whether players or creatures can be forcibly removed from
    a vehicle seat. The method evaluates internal flags or properties associated with
    the vehicle seat entry to determine ejectability. It does not perform any external
    validation or side effects, and simply returns a boolean value based on the seat's
    configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the vehicle seat is configured to allow ejection of passengers;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a vehicle seat is ejectable
    code: "VehicleSeatEntry* seat = sVehicleSeatStore.LookupEntry(12345);\nif (seat\
      \ && seat->IsEjectable()) {\n    // Handle ejectable seat logic\n    printf(\"\
      Seat can be ejected\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle non-ejectable seat\n   \
      \ printf(\"Seat cannot be ejected\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data from the VehicleSeat.dbc file and assumes
    that the entry has been properly loaded into memory. The result is determined
    by flags or fields within the vehicle seat entry structure, which may vary depending
    on the game version or patch.
