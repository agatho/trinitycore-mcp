  class: AuraEffect
  method: ResetPeriodic
  signature: void AuraEffect::ResetPeriodic(bool resetPeriodicTimer)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the periodic timer for the aura effect, optionally resetting the periodic
    tick counter.
  description: The ResetPeriodic method is used to reset the internal periodic timer
    of an AuraEffect, which controls how often a periodic spell effect (such as DoT
    or HoT) applies its damage or healing. When called, it can either reset only the
    timer or also reset the periodic tick counter depending on the parameter value.
    This functionality is commonly used during aura refreshes, reapplications, or
    when certain conditions require resetting the periodic effect timing. The method
    directly affects the behavior of ongoing periodic effects without removing the
    aura itself.
  parameters:
  - name: resetPeriodicTimer
    description: If true, resets both the periodic timer and tick counter; if false,
      only resets the timer while preserving the tick count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset periodic timer for a DoT aura
    code: "AuraEffect* auraEffect = player->GetAuraEffect(12345, 0);\nif (auraEffect)\n\
      {\n    auraEffect->ResetPeriodic(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset only the timer without resetting tick count
    code: "AuraEffect* auraEffect = player->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_ID, EFFECT_INDEX);\n\
      if (auraEffect)\n{\n    auraEffect->ResetPeriodic(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore engine during
    aura updates or refreshes. It's important to ensure that the AuraEffect pointer
    is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. The effect of
    calling ResetPeriodic with resetPeriodicTimer=true is similar to restarting a
    periodic spell effect from its initial tick.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or null AuraEffect pointer will result
    in a crash. Always verify that the aura effect exists and is active before invoking
    ResetPeriodic. Misuse can cause unexpected behavior in periodic effects such as
    double-dipping damage or incorrect healing application.
