  class: GuildIntegration
  method: OrganizeGuildRuns
  signature: void GuildIntegration::OrganizeGuildRuns(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Organizes guild runs by processing player data and coordinating group activities.
  description: The OrganizeGuildRuns method is responsible for managing and coordinating
    guild-related activities, particularly focusing on organizing group runs or instances.
    This method likely processes player data to ensure proper grouping, assigns roles,
    and handles logistics such as instance scheduling, loot distribution, and communication
    between guild members. It may also handle queue management for dungeons, raids,
    or other group content. The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's
    guild management system and integrates with the broader player and group subsystems
    to facilitate seamless guild participation in world content.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index
      within the guild. This parameter likely serves as input for identifying which
      player's data should be processed during the organization of guild runs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.OrganizeGuildRuns(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Multiple Players
    code: "std::vector<int> playerIds = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nGuildIntegration guildInt;\n\
      for (int playerId : playerIds) {\n    guildInt.OrganizeGuildRuns(&playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild data structures and may
    require the player to be part of an active guild. It might also perform synchronization
    operations to ensure all players are properly coordinated before initiating group
    activities.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it modifies player data through a pointer,
    so care must be taken to ensure that the referenced integer is valid and properly
    initialized. Incorrect usage may lead to undefined behavior or data corruption.
