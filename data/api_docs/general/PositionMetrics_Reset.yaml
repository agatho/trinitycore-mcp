  method: Reset
  signature: void PositionMetrics::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all position metrics to their default values.
  description: The Reset method clears and initializes all internal position tracking
    metrics within the PositionMetrics class. This method is typically used to clear
    accumulated data when starting a new measurement period or when resetting performance
    tracking for pathfinding or movement calculations. The method ensures that all
    counters, accumulators, and statistical values are set back to their initial state,
    allowing for clean metric collection in subsequent operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'PositionMetrics metrics;

      metrics.Reset(); // Resets all internal metrics to default values'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before Performance Measurement
    code: 'PositionMetrics metrics;

      // ... perform some movement calculations ...

      metrics.Reset(); // Prepare for new measurement cycle

      // ... continue with fresh metrics ...'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting new performance measurements
    to ensure accurate results. The reset operation is lightweight and does not involve
    memory allocation or deallocation.
