documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the cell coordinates for a given position within the
    LOS cache grid.
  description: The GetCellCoords method converts a world position coordinate into
    corresponding cell coordinates within the LOS (Line of Sight) cache grid system.
    This is essential for efficiently managing and querying line-of-sight data across
    different map cells. The method takes a single position value and maps it to a
    pair of unsigned 32-bit integers representing the X and Y cell coordinates. The
    implementation likely uses internal constants or configuration values to determine
    cell size and grid alignment. This functionality is crucial for performance optimization
    in large-scale world environments where only relevant cells need to be checked
    for line-of-sight calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::pair<uint32, uint32> where the first element represents the X cell
    coordinate and the second element represents the Y cell coordinate. Both values
    are unsigned 32-bit integers indicating the position within the LOS cache grid
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LOSCache cache;

      int position = 1000;

      std::pair<uint32, uint32> coords = cache.GetCellCoords(position);

      // coords.first contains X cell coordinate

      // coords.second contains Y cell coordinate'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the LOS system to determine which
    grid cells need to be checked for line-of-sight queries. The exact mapping logic
    depends on internal cell size constants and world coordinate scaling factors.
    Performance is critical as this method may be called frequently during pathfinding
    or visibility checks.
  warnings: The parameter 'pos' is passed by const reference, but the method signature
    suggests it's a single value rather than a coordinate pair. This could indicate
    either an error in the signature or that the method handles only one dimension
    at a time, which would be unusual for typical grid coordinate systems.
