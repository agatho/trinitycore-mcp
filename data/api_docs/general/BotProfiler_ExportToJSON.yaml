  class: BotProfiler
  method: ExportToJSON
  signature: void BotProfiler::ExportToJSON(const ProfilingSession * session, std::ofstream
    & file)
documentation:
  brief: Exports profiling session data to a JSON-formatted file.
  description: The ExportToJSON method serializes profiling session data into a structured
    JSON format and writes it to the provided output file stream. This functionality
    is typically used for analyzing bot performance, debugging, or generating reports
    on gameplay behavior. The method takes a pointer to a ProfilingSession object
    which contains the collected profiling data and outputs it in a human-readable
    and machine-parseable JSON structure. It assumes that the file stream is already
    opened and valid for writing.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the ProfilingSession object containing the data to be
      exported. Must not be null.
  - name: file
    description: Reference to an open std::ofstream stream where the JSON output will
      be written. The file must already be opened in write mode.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Export Usage
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      ProfilingSession* session = new ProfilingSession();

      // ... populate session with profiling data ...

      std::ofstream outFile("bot_profile.json");

      profiler.ExportToJSON(session, outFile);

      outFile.close();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method does not handle file opening or closing; the caller is responsible
    for managing the file stream lifecycle. It's recommended to ensure that the ProfilingSession
    object contains valid data before calling this method to avoid empty or malformed
    JSON output.
