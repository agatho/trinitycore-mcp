  method: GetAbilitiesByType
  signature: int ThreatAbilitiesDB::GetAbilitiesByType(ThreatAbilityType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of threat abilities associated with a specified threat
    ability type.
  description: The GetAbilitiesByType method retrieves the count of threat abilities
    that are registered under a specific ThreatAbilityType. This method is typically
    used within the context of World of Warcraft's threat system, where different
    types of abilities (such as attacks, spells, or passive effects) contribute to
    a creature's or player's threat generation. The method does not return the actual
    ability data but rather the quantity of abilities matching the given type. It
    is commonly used for internal calculations and logic decisions within the AI and
    combat systems of TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of threat abilities registered for the
    specified ThreatAbilityType. Returns zero if no abilities are found for the given
    type or if an invalid type is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Get count of melee attack abilities
    code: 'ThreatAbilitiesDB db;

      int meleeCount = db.GetAbilitiesByType(ThreatAbilityType::MELEE);

      // Returns the number of melee-based threat abilities in the database'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal data structures such as
    maps or arrays that store ability definitions indexed by type. It may involve
    lookups or iterations depending on how the database is structured internally.
