  class: WorldObject
  method: ProcessPositionDataChanged
  signature: void WorldObject::ProcessPositionDataChanged(const int & data)
documentation:
  brief: Processes position data changes for the WorldObject, updating internal state
    and notifying relevant systems of movement or positional updates.
  description: The ProcessPositionDataChanged method is responsible for handling updates
    to a WorldObject's position data. This method is typically invoked when an object's
    location, orientation, or other spatial properties are modified within the game
    world. It ensures that internal state reflects the new position and triggers necessary
    subsystems such as visibility updates, collision detection recalculations, or
    zone transition logic. The method plays a critical role in maintaining synchronization
    between client and server representations of object positions, especially for
    dynamic entities like players, creatures, and game objects. This function is usually
    called internally by the core engine during movement operations and should not
    typically be invoked directly by external code unless implementing custom movement
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: An integer parameter representing the position data change flags
      or identifier. The exact meaning of this value depends on how it's used internally
      by the core engine, but it generally indicates what type of positional update
      occurred (e.g., movement, rotation, teleportation). Valid values are determined
      by internal constants and bitmasks defined within the TrinityCore codebase.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement handler
    code: "void MovementHandler::OnPlayerMove(Player* player, const int& positionData)\n\
      {\n    player->ProcessPositionDataChanged(positionData);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom object position update
    code: "void CustomGameObject::UpdatePosition(float x, float y, float z)\n{\n \
      \   // Update internal position\n    SetPosition(x, y, z);\n    \n    // Notify\
      \ core about the change\n    ProcessPositionDataChanged(1); // Assuming 1 means\
      \ 'movement'\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal WorldObject lifecycle and should only
    be called when position data has actually changed. It's designed to be efficient
    and avoid redundant processing, but excessive calls may impact performance. The
    parameter value 'data' must be properly interpreted by the calling code to ensure
    correct behavior across different movement scenarios.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method without proper context or validation
    can cause synchronization issues between client and server. It's not intended
    for general use outside of core engine components and should only be called when
    you're certain that a position change has occurred and needs to be processed by
    the system.
