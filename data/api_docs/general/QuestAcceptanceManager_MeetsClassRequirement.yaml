documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player meets the class requirements for accepting a quest
  description: The MeetsClassRequirement method evaluates whether the current player
    character satisfies the class-based prerequisites defined for a specific quest.
    This check typically verifies that the player's class aligns with the quest's
    allowed classes, which is a common requirement in World of Warcraft-style quest
    systems. The method returns true if the player's class is compatible with the
    quest's class restrictions, or false otherwise. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining game balance and ensuring players only accept quests appropriate
    to their character's class.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest ID. The method uses
      this ID to retrieve quest data and check class requirements against the current
      player's class.
  returns: Returns true if the player's class meets the quest's class requirements,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the player is eligible to accept the specified
    quest based on class restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance Check
    code: "if (questManager.MeetsClassRequirement(&questId)) {\n    // Player can\
      \ accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ cannot accept the quest due to class restrictions\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the class requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal quest data structures and player class
    information. It may be called during quest acceptance flow, before allowing a
    player to initiate a quest. The implementation probably involves checking against
    a list or bitmask of allowed classes for the given quest ID.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest parameter points to a valid quest ID; passing an
    invalid or uninitialized pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This method
    should only be called when a player is attempting to accept a quest, not during
    general gameplay operations.
