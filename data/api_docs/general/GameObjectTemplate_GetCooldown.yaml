  signature: uint32 GameObjectTemplate::GetCooldown() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the cooldown time in milliseconds for the game object template.
  description: The GetCooldown method retrieves the cooldown duration associated with
    a GameObjectTemplate. This cooldown represents the time interval during which
    the game object cannot be interacted with or activated again after its initial
    use. In World of Warcraft context, this is commonly used for doors, chests, levers,
    and other interactive objects that have a reset timer. The returned value is expressed
    in milliseconds and can be zero if no cooldown is defined for the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the cooldown time in milliseconds. A return
    value of 0 indicates that there is no cooldown set for this game object template.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve cooldown of a game object
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(176543);\n\
      uint32 cooldown = goTemplate->GetCooldown();\nif (cooldown > 0)\n{\n    // Object\
      \ has a cooldown period\n    printf(\"Cooldown: %u ms\\n\", cooldown);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // No cooldown set\n    printf(\"No cooldown defined.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data stored in the GameObjectTemplate structure,
    which is typically loaded from the game database at server startup. The cooldown
    value is usually defined in the 'cooldown' column of the gameobject_template table
    in the TrinityCore database.
