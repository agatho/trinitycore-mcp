documentation:
  brief: Destroys the AchievementGlobalMgr instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AchievementGlobalMgr class is responsible for
    cleaning up all dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the global
    achievement manager. This includes releasing any cached achievement data, clearing
    internal containers, and ensuring proper cleanup of singleton resources. The destructor
    is automatically invoked when an instance of AchievementGlobalMgr goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no memory leaks occur during the
    shutdown process of the achievement system within TrinityCore.

  - title: Automatic destruction of AchievementGlobalMgr
    code: "void Cleanup() {\n    // AchievementGlobalMgr is a singleton, so it's destroyed\
      \ automatically\n    // when the application shuts down or the singleton instance\
      \ is deleted\n}\n\n// Example usage in a shutdown context\nint main() {\n  \
      \  // ... game initialization ...\n    // When program exits, the destructor\
      \ is called automatically\n    return 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Since AchievementGlobalMgr is typically implemented as a singleton, this
    destructor is usually invoked only once during application shutdown. Developers
    should not manually delete instances of this class unless they are working with
    custom implementations or testing scenarios.
