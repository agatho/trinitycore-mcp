  class: WindwalkerSEFTracker
  method: GetTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 WindwalkerSEFTracker::GetTimeRemaining() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the remaining time in milliseconds for the Windwalker SEF effect.
  description: The GetTimeRemaining method returns the duration left on the Windwalker
    SEF (Storm, Earth, and Fire) buff as a uint32 value representing milliseconds.
    This method is typically used within the context of a Windwalker monk's abilities,
    particularly in relation to the SEF tracking system that manages the cooldown
    and duration of these elemental effects. The returned value can be used to determine
    how much time remains before the effect expires or becomes available again. This
    method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the milliseconds remaining until the Windwalker
    SEF effect expires. Returns 0 if the effect is not active or has already expired.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 timeLeft = windwalkerSEFTracker->GetTimeRemaining();\nif (timeLeft\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // SEF effect is active, display remaining time\n    printf(\"\
      SEF expires in %u ms\\n\", timeLeft);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Effect Status
    code: "uint32 remaining = windwalkerSEFTracker->GetTimeRemaining();\nif (remaining\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // SEF is not active, can be cast again\n    printf(\"SEF is\
      \ available for casting\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Calculate seconds remaining\n\
      \    uint32 seconds = remaining / 1000;\n    printf(\"SEF will expire in %u\
      \ seconds\\n\", seconds);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the WindwalkerSEFTracker instance has been properly
    initialized and contains valid data about the SEF effect. The returned value is
    in milliseconds, which aligns with TrinityCore's standard time representation
    for spell effects and cooldowns.
