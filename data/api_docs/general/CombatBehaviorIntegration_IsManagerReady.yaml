documentation:
  brief: Checks if the combat behavior manager is initialized and ready for use.
  description: The IsManagerReady method determines whether the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    class has successfully initialized its internal combat behavior manager. This
    method typically verifies that all necessary resources, configurations, and dependencies
    have been properly set up before allowing combat-related operations to proceed.
    The check is essential in TrinityCore's AI framework to prevent operations on
    an uninitialized or improperly configured combat system. This method does not
    modify any state and is generally used as a safety check before invoking other
    combat behavior methods.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat behavior manager is fully initialized and ready
    for use; returns false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates
    that initialization has not yet completed or that an error occurred during setup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (combatIntegration.IsManagerReady()) {\n    // Proceed with combat behavior\
      \ operations\n    combatIntegration.ExecuteCombatAction();\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle uninitialized state\n    LogError(\"Combat manager not ready\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (combatIntegration.IsManagerReady())\
      \ {\n        combatIntegration.UpdateCombatBehavior(diff);\n    } else {\n \
      \       // Attempt to initialize if not ready\n        combatIntegration.InitializeManager();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically lightweight and performs a simple state check rather
    than complex initialization logic. It's recommended to cache the result of this
    check in performance-critical sections to avoid repeated calls. The method should
    be called before any other combat behavior methods to ensure system stability.
  warnings: Calling other combat behavior methods before IsManagerReady() returns
    true may result in undefined behavior or crashes. This method does not guarantee
    that the manager is fully functional after returning true, as some dynamic initialization
    might still be occurring in background threads.
