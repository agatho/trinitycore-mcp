documentation:
  brief: Invites a player to join the group managed by the GroupCoordinator.
  description: The InviteToGroup method attempts to invite a specified player to join
    the group that is being coordinated by this GroupCoordinator instance. This method
    typically checks if the player is eligible for invitation, such as being within
    range, not already in a group, and meeting any relevant game rules or restrictions.
    It handles the necessary communication with the client to display the group invitation
    prompt and manages the internal state of the group coordinator. The method returns
    true if the invitation was successfully initiated, or false if it failed due to
    various conditions such as the player being in a different instance, already in
    a group, or other game logic constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully invited to join the group;
    otherwise, returns false if the invitation could not be sent due to game rules,
    player state, or other restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Invitation
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get a reference to a player\nGroupCoordinator*\
      \ coordinator = ...; // Get a reference to the group coordinator\nbool success\
      \ = coordinator->InviteToGroup(targetPlayer);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ was invited successfully\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"group\", \"Player %s has been\
      \ invited to the group.\", targetPlayer->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   // Invitation failed\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"group\", \"Failed to invite player\
      \ %s to the group.\", targetPlayer->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with group management systems
    and may involve network communication to send invitation packets to the client.
    The actual group creation or joining logic might be handled separately by other
    methods such as AcceptGroupInvite or CreateGroup.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be
    aware that repeated calls to this method without checking the player's current
    group status may result in multiple invitations being sent, which can confuse
    players or cause client-side issues.
