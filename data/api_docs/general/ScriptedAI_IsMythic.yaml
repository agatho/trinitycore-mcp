documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current encounter is running in Mythic difficulty.
  description: The IsMythic method checks if the ongoing dungeon or raid encounter
    is being conducted at Mythic difficulty level. This is commonly used in ScriptedAI
    implementations to adjust behavior, abilities, or loot distribution based on the
    encounter's difficulty. The method returns true when the instance is running in
    Mythic mode and false otherwise. It is particularly useful for bosses or NPCs
    that have different mechanics or increased challenge levels in higher difficulties.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current encounter is in Mythic difficulty, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Difficulty Check
    code: "if (me->GetAI()->IsMythic())\n{\n    // Apply Mythic-specific behavior\n\
      \    DoMythicAbility();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Usage
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n     \
      \   return;\n\n    if (IsMythic())\n    {\n        // Increase damage or apply\
      \ debuffs in Mythic\n        DoMythicEnhancement();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n\
      \        // Normal difficulty behavior\n        DoNormalAbility();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the instance's difficulty setting and should only be
    called during active encounters. It does not account for dynamic difficulty changes
    during an encounter.
