  method: LoadDungeonData
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::LoadDungeonData()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads dungeon-specific behavior data for the DungeonBehavior
    instance.
  description: The LoadDungeonData method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all dungeon-specific behavioral configurations and data required by the DungeonBehavior
    class. This method typically reads from database tables or configuration files
    to populate internal structures with information such as encounter IDs, spawn
    locations, quest triggers, and other dungeon-specific mechanics. It ensures that
    the behavior of the dungeon is properly set up before any gameplay logic begins.
    The method should be called once during the initialization phase of a dungeon
    instance, and it's expected that all necessary database connections and data sources
    are already available. This method does not return any value but modifies internal
    state variables of the DungeonBehavior object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Initialization
    code: 'DungeonBehavior* dungeonBehavior = new DungeonBehavior();

      dungeonBehavior->LoadDungeonData();

      // Dungeon behavior is now initialized with all required data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that database connections are already established and
    that the necessary tables containing dungeon data are accessible. It's recommended
    to call this method only once per dungeon instance to avoid redundant data loading
    operations.
  warnings: Calling LoadDungeonData multiple times on the same instance may lead to
    undefined behavior or memory leaks if not properly implemented. Ensure all required
    database resources are available before invoking this method.
