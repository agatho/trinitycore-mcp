  class: BotActionProcessor
  method: ExecuteEquipItem
  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteEquipItem(Player * bot, const
    BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Equips an item on the specified bot player based on the provided action parameters.
  description: The ExecuteEquipItem method processes a bot action to equip an item
    onto a given player bot. It evaluates the action's parameters to determine which
    item should be equipped and performs the necessary inventory and equipment operations.
    This method is typically invoked as part of the bot's AI decision-making process
    when it determines that equipping an item would benefit its performance or role
    in combat. The method ensures proper validation of item eligibility, slot compatibility,
    and handles any required unequipping of existing items in the target slot. It
    returns a BotActionResult indicating success or failure of the operation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will equip
      the item. Must be a valid player instance and should be controlled by the AI
      system.
  - name: action
    description: Reference to a BotAction structure containing details about the item
      to be equipped, including item ID, slot information, and other relevant parameters
      for the equipping process.
  returns: BotActionResult indicating whether the equip operation succeeded or failed.
    Possible values include SUCCESS if the item was successfully equipped, FAILED
    if there was an error during the process (e.g., invalid item, incompatible slot),
    or other specific result codes depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equip Item Usage
    code: "BotAction action;\naction.type = BOT_ACTION_EQUIP_ITEM;\naction.itemId\
      \ = 12345;\naction.slotId = EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND;\nBotActionResult result\
      \ = processor.ExecuteEquipItem(bot, action);\nif (result == BOT_ACTION_SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Item equipped successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player is in a valid state for item manipulation
    and that the item ID provided in the action corresponds to an actual item in the
    game database. It may perform internal checks such as slot validation, item type
    compatibility, and inventory space availability.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player or with invalid parameters can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot is properly initialized
    and that the action data contains valid item and slot identifiers before invoking
    this function.
