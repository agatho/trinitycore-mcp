documentation:
  brief: Moves a PetitionMgr object to another PetitionMgr object using move semantics.
  description: This method serves as a move constructor for the PetitionMgr class,
    transferring ownership of resources from one PetitionMgr instance to another.
    It is typically used in scenarios where an existing PetitionMgr object needs to
    be replaced or reassigned without copying its contents. The operation is efficient
    and avoids unnecessary memory allocation or deep copying. This constructor is
    particularly relevant in container classes or when managing dynamic objects that
    may be moved between different scopes or data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another PetitionMgr object whose resources
      will be moved into this instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'PetitionMgr mgr1;

      // ... perform operations on mgr1 ...

      PetitionMgr mgr2 = std::move(mgr1); // Move constructor invoked here'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which should only be called with an
    rvalue (temporary object or explicitly moved lvalue). After the move, the source
    object's state is left in a valid but unspecified state. Developers should ensure
    that no further operations are performed on the moved-from object unless it is
    reassigned.
  warnings: Using this constructor on an already moved-from object may result in undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that you're moving from a temporary or explicitly marked
    rvalue to avoid accidental copying or double-free errors.
