  method: OnCombatStartSpecific
  signature: void FuryWarriorRefactored::OnCombatStartSpecific(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat-specific behavior for a Fury Warrior when entering combat
    with a target
  description: The OnCombatStartSpecific method is called when a Fury Warrior AI unit
    enters combat mode. This method handles the initialization of combat-specific
    mechanics, such as setting up threat generation, preparing special abilities,
    and configuring combat state variables. It typically executes before the general
    combat start logic and may include Fury Warrior class-specific actions like activating
    berserker stance or initializing rage generation. The method is part of the AI
    framework in TrinityCore and integrates with the core combat system to ensure
    proper unit behavior during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the combat target. This parameter
      defines which entity the Fury Warrior will engage in combat with. Must be a
      valid Unit pointer; null values should not be passed to this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI implementation
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::OnCombatStartSpecific(Unit* target)\n{\n  \
      \  // Initialize combat-specific behavior\n    me->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \    me->Attack(target, true);\n    // Additional Fury Warrior specific logic\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with ability preparation
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::OnCombatStartSpecific(Unit* target)\n{\n  \
      \  // Reset any combat state variables\n    _isInCombat = true;\n    _rage =\
      \ 0;\n    \n    // Prepare for combat\n    me->SetPower(POWER_RAGE, 0);\n  \
      \  me->CastSpell(target, SPELL_BERSERKER_STANCE, true);\n    \n    // Start\
      \ combat timer or other mechanics\n    _combatTimer = 5000;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core AI system when a unit transitions
    into combat state. Developers should ensure that all necessary initialization
    steps are completed before returning from this function. The target parameter
    must be validated to prevent null pointer dereferences.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as target may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Ensure that the target is valid and alive before using it in this method. This
    method should not perform heavy operations that could block the AI thread for
    extended periods.
