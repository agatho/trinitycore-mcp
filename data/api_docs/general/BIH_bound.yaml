  class: BIH
  method: bound
  signature: const int & BIH::bound() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bound value of the BIH object, which represents a bounding index
    hierarchy used for spatial partitioning in collision detection.
  description: The bound() method retrieves the bound value associated with a BIH
    (Bounding Index Hierarchy) object. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    server implementation, BIH structures are utilized for efficient spatial queries
    and collision detection within the game world. This method provides access to
    the hierarchical bounding information that defines how objects are organized in
    space for fast retrieval and intersection testing. The returned reference allows
    direct access to the internal bound value without copying, ensuring performance
    efficiency. This is typically used internally by the server's spatial indexing
    systems rather than being called directly by script or game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the bound value of the
    BIH structure. The bound value usually indicates a specific dimension or boundary
    limit within the hierarchical structure, such as a minimum or maximum coordinate
    value in one of the spatial axes.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing BIH bound value
    code: 'BIH bih;

      const int& bound_value = bih.bound();

      // Use bound_value for spatial query operations

      std::cout << "Bound value: " << bound_value << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference, meaning the returned value should
    not be modified. The BIH class is part of TrinityCore's internal spatial indexing
    system and is primarily used for optimizing collision detection and object queries
    in the game world. Performance considerations are minimal since this is a simple
    getter method that directly accesses stored data.
