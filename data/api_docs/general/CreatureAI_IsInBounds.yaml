  signature: bool CreatureAI::IsInBounds(const CreatureBoundary & boundary, const
    Position * who)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a creature's current position is within the specified boundary
    limits.
  description: The IsInBounds method determines whether a creature's current location
    falls within the defined spatial boundaries. This utility function is commonly
    used in AI behavior logic to ensure creatures remain within designated areas,
    such as patrol routes or instance boundaries. The method evaluates the creature's
    position against the provided boundary constraints and returns true if the creature
    is inside the bounds, false otherwise. It is particularly useful for preventing
    creatures from wandering outside of intended areas during scripted events or while
    following patrol paths.
  parameters:
  - name: boundary
    description: The CreatureBoundary object defining the spatial limits to check
      against. This typically represents a rectangular area with minimum and maximum
      X, Y, Z coordinates that define valid movement space for the creature.
  - name: who
    description: Optional pointer to a Position object representing the specific location
      to test. If null, the method uses the current position of the creature's AI
      instance.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position (or creature's current position)
    is within the boundary limits; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boundary Check
    code: "if (creatureAI->IsInBounds(boundary, nullptr)) {\n    // Creature is within\
      \ bounds\n    DoSomething();\n} else {\n    // Creature has left bounds\n  \
      \  ReturnToPatrol();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Specific Position
    code: "Position targetPos;\ntargetPos.Relocate(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);\nif (creatureAI->IsInBounds(boundary,\
      \ &targetPos)) {\n    // Target position is within bounds\n    MoveToTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple boundary check using coordinate comparison.
    It does not account for terrain height or obstacles; it only evaluates the X,
    Y, Z coordinates against the defined limits. The boundary parameter should be
    properly initialized with valid min/max values before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the CreatureBoundary object is properly configured with meaningful
    coordinate ranges. Using uninitialized or invalid boundaries may lead to incorrect
    results. When passing a Position pointer, make sure it points to a valid memory
    location to avoid undefined behavior.
