documentation:
  brief: Determines whether this faction template is hostile toward another faction
    template.
  description: The IsHostileTo method evaluates the hostility relationship between
    this FactionTemplateEntry and another FactionTemplateEntry. It checks if the current
    faction template has a hostile standing with the provided faction template based
    on internal faction relations defined in the game's database. This method is commonly
    used during combat, interaction, or AI decision-making processes to determine
    whether two factions should be considered enemies. The result of this check is
    fundamental to determining player versus NPC hostility, group dynamics, and quest-related
    faction interactions within World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current faction template is hostile toward the provided
    faction template; otherwise returns false. This indicates that the two factions
    are considered enemies according to the game's faction system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hostility Check
    code: "FactionTemplateEntry* playerFaction = sFactionTemplateStore.LookupEntry(player->GetFactionTemplateId());\n\
      FactionTemplateEntry* npcFaction = sFactionTemplateStore.LookupEntry(npc->getFaction());\n\
      if (playerFaction && npcFaction && playerFaction->IsHostileTo(npcFaction)) {\n\
      \    // Player and NPC are hostile\n    player->Attack(npc, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Hostility in AI Logic
    code: "bool Unit::CanAttack(Unit* target) const {\n    FactionTemplateEntry* thisFaction\
      \ = sFactionTemplateStore.LookupEntry(this->getFaction());\n    FactionTemplateEntry*\
      \ targetFaction = sFactionTemplateStore.LookupEntry(target->getFaction());\n\
      \    \n    if (!thisFaction || !targetFaction) return false;\n    \n    return\
      \ thisFaction->IsHostileTo(targetFaction);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on faction template relations defined in the game's database
    and does not consider dynamic reputation changes or temporary faction states.
    The implementation uses cached faction data, so any runtime modifications to faction
    relationships may not be immediately reflected unless the faction templates are
    reloaded.
  warnings: Ensure that both FactionTemplateEntry pointers are valid before calling
    this method; passing null pointers will likely result in undefined behavior. This
    method does not account for temporary faction states or dynamic reputation changes
    that might occur during gameplay.
