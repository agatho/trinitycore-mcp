documentation:
  brief: Checks if a kill objective for a quest has been fulfilled
  description: The CheckKillObjective method verifies whether the specified kill objective
    within a given quest has been completed by the player. This method is typically
    used during quest progress evaluation to determine if a player has defeated the
    required number of creatures or NPCs as part of a kill-based quest objective.
    The method evaluates the current state of the quest's kill counter against the
    required amount and returns true if the objective is complete, false otherwise.
    It is an essential component in the quest completion system for tracking player
    actions related to creature kills.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing the kill objective to be checked
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index of the specific kill objective within the quest's objectives
      array (0-based)
  returns: Returns true if the specified kill objective has been fulfilled, false
    otherwise. The method will return false if the quest is null, the objective index
    is out of bounds, or if the required number of kills has not yet been reached.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check a kill objective
    code: "if (player->GetQuestManager().CheckKillObjective(quest, 0)) {\n    // Kill\
      \ objective 0 is complete\n    player->CompleteQuest(quest->GetQuestId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple kill objectives in a loop
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < quest->GetObjectiveCount(); ++i) {\n    if (quest->GetQuestObjective(i)->GetType()\
      \ == QUEST_OBJECTIVE_KILL) {\n        if (!player->GetQuestManager().CheckKillObjective(quest,\
      \ i)) {\n            // Objective not complete, continue with quest progression\n\
      \            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n// All kill objectives are complete"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest progress tracking system and assumes
    that the player's kill counts have already been updated through appropriate event
    handlers. The method does not modify any quest state directly but only evaluates
    the current state. It is recommended to call this method after processing player
    actions that might affect quest progress, such as creature kills or quest updates.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid quest pointers or objective indices
    as it may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the quest object and objective
    index are valid before calling this method. The method does not perform any automatic
    quest completion - it only checks if an objective is complete.
