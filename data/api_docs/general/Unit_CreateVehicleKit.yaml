documentation:
  brief: Initializes and creates a vehicle kit for the unit using the specified ID
    and creature entry.
  description: The CreateVehicleKit method sets up a vehicle kit for the Unit instance,
    allowing it to function as a vehicle within the game world. This method is typically
    invoked during unit creation or when a vehicle needs to be dynamically assigned
    to a creature. The method requires a unique identifier (id) and the creature entry
    associated with the vehicle. It handles internal setup of vehicle-related data
    structures and may perform validation checks on the provided parameters. The loading
    parameter indicates whether this initialization occurs during server loading or
    runtime, affecting how certain systems are initialized. This functionality is
    essential for enabling vehicle mechanics such as passenger boarding, movement
    control, and interaction with vehicle-specific game objects.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for the vehicle kit. This ID is used to reference
      the specific vehicle configuration within the game's database or system.
  - name: creatureEntry
    description: The creature entry ID that defines the type of vehicle being created.
      This corresponds to entries in the creature_template table and determines vehicle
      behavior, stats, and appearance.
  - name: loading
    description: Boolean flag indicating if this method is called during server loading
      (true) or runtime (false). Affects initialization order and system setup.
  returns: Returns true if the vehicle kit was successfully created and initialized,
    false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid parameters, missing data, or
    internal system errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Kit Creation
    code: "Unit* unit = ...; // Get a reference to a unit\nbool success = unit->CreateVehicleKit(12345,\
      \ 1234, false);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Vehicle kit created successfully\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Vehicle kit created for unit\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Handle failure case\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to create vehicle kit for\
      \ unit\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading Vehicle Kit During Server Startup
    code: "Unit* unit = ...; // Get a reference to a unit during server load\nbool\
      \ success = unit->CreateVehicleKit(54321, 9876, true);\nif (success)\n{\n  \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Vehicle kit loaded for unit during startup\");\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to load vehicle kit for unit during startup\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    handling vehicle-related systems. The 'loading' parameter affects how certain
    vehicle data is processed and cached. It's recommended to call this method only
    on valid Unit instances that are intended to function as vehicles. Performance-wise,
    this operation should be lightweight but may involve database lookups depending
    on implementation details.
  warnings: Calling this method on non-vehicle units or with invalid IDs/creature
    entries can lead to undefined behavior or system instability. Ensure the provided
    creatureEntry corresponds to a valid vehicle template in the database. The loading
    parameter must be set correctly; incorrect usage during server startup may cause
    initialization issues.
