  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: SpendFury
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::SpendFury(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Spends a specified amount of fury from the Demon Hunter's resource pool.
  description: The SpendFury method reduces the current fury amount of a Demon Hunter
    by the specified value. This method is typically used during ability execution
    to consume fury resources required for various class abilities such as Eye Beam,
    Fel Rush, or other fury-consuming spells. The method ensures that the fury spent
    does not exceed the available fury amount, preventing negative values. It is commonly
    invoked within the AI logic of Demon Hunters to manage resource allocation and
    ability usage.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of fury to spend. Must be a non-negative integer representing
      the fury cost of an ability or action.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fury Spending
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UseEyeBeam()\n{\n    if (me->HasAura(SPELL_EYE_BEAM_AURA))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Spend 50 fury to cast Eye Beam\n    SpendFury(50);\n\
      \    \n    DoCast(me, SPELL_EYE_BEAM);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Fury Spending
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Spend fury only if enough is available\n    if\
      \ (GetFury() >= 30)\n    {\n        SpendFury(30);\n        DoCast(me, SPELL_FEL_RUSH);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Demon Hunter has sufficient fury
    available. Calling it with an amount greater than current fury will result in
    the fury being reduced to zero, but no error is thrown. This method is part of
    the core resource management system for Demon Hunters in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking available fury may lead to unexpected
    behavior or resource depletion. Always validate that sufficient fury exists before
    spending it to avoid unintended consequences in gameplay mechanics.
