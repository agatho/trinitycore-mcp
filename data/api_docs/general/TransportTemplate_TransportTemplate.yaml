documentation:
  brief: Moves a TransportTemplate object, transferring its resources to a new instance.
  description: The TransportTemplate move constructor initializes a TransportTemplate
    object by transferring ownership of resources from a temporary (rvalue) TransportTemplate
    object. This operation is part of C++'s move semantics, allowing efficient resource
    transfer without deep copying. The source object becomes invalid after the move
    and should not be used. In the context of TrinityCore's transport system, this
    constructor likely handles the initialization of transport templates when moving
    pre-constructed objects, such as during container reassignment or object lifecycle
    management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move TransportTemplate to new variable
    code: 'TransportTemplate template1;

      // ... initialize template1 ...

      TransportTemplate template2 = std::move(template1); // Moves resources from
      template1 to template2'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. After calling this constructor,
    the source TransportTemplate object should not be used as its state becomes undefined.
    The move operation is typically more efficient than copying because it transfers
    ownership of internal resources rather than duplicating them.
  warnings: Using the source TransportTemplate after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that no further operations are performed on the moved-from object
    to avoid crashes or data corruption.
