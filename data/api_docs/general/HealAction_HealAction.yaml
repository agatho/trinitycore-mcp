documentation:
  brief: Executes a healing action using the specified spell ID.
  description: The HealAction method performs a healing operation within the TrinityCore
    framework, typically used by AI-controlled units or game systems to apply healing
    effects. This method is part of the general AI action system and allows for targeted
    healing based on provided spell identifiers. The implementation likely handles
    spell validation, target selection, and execution logic within the context of
    the game's combat and healing mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Action
    code: 'HealAction healAction;

      healAction.HealAction(2060);

      // Executes the healing action using the spell ID for Heal'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system and may interact with target
    selection logic, spell cooldowns, and unit health management. It should be called
    within appropriate game context where healing actions are valid.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID provided corresponds to a valid healing spell
    in the TrinityCore database. Calling this method without proper context or validation
    may result in undefined behavior or failed healing attempts.
