  class: BattlegroundQueue
  method: RemovePlayer
  signature: void BattlegroundQueue::RemovePlayer(int guid, bool decreaseInvitedCount)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the battleground queue, optionally decreasing their
    invited count.
  description: The RemovePlayer method removes a specified player from the battleground
    queue system. It takes a player's global unique identifier (GUID) and an optional
    boolean flag to determine whether the player's invited count should be decreased.
    This method is typically invoked when a player leaves a battleground queue, either
    manually or due to timeout or other game conditions. The method ensures proper
    cleanup of the player's queue entry and updates related internal tracking structures.
    It plays a critical role in maintaining accurate queue state during battleground
    matchmaking and player management.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from
      the queue. This value uniquely identifies the player within the game world.
  - name: decreaseInvitedCount
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the player's invited count should
      be decreased. If true, the method will reduce the number of times this player
      has been invited to a battleground.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage removing a player from queue
    code: 'BattlegroundQueue bgQueue;

      uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      bgQueue.RemovePlayer(playerGuid, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing player without decreasing invited count
    code: 'BattlegroundQueue bgQueue;

      uint32 playerGuid = 67890;

      bgQueue.RemovePlayer(playerGuid, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground queue management system and should
    only be called when a player's queue status needs to be updated. It assumes that
    the player GUID is valid and corresponds to an existing player in the queue. The
    method does not perform any validation on the GUID itself, so calling it with
    an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling RemovePlayer with an invalid GUID can cause memory corruption
    or other unexpected behavior. Always ensure that the player is actually present
    in the queue before attempting removal. Additionally, be cautious when setting
    'decreaseInvitedCount' to true as it affects matchmaking logic and player invitation
    tracking.
