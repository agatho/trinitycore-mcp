documentation:
  brief: Sends spell non-melee damage log information to the target player's client
  description: This method sends a spell non-melee damage log packet to the target
    player's client, which contains information about damage dealt by spells that
    are not melee attacks. It is used in conjunction with spell damage calculations
    and can be triggered by various spell effects including periodic damage, direct
    damage, and damage over time effects. The method handles the transmission of damage
    logs for spells that do not involve melee combat, such as fireball, shadow word
    pain, or other magical damage sources.
  parameters:
  - name: log
    description: A pointer to a SpellNonMeleeDamage structure containing the damage
      information to be sent to the target player's client. This structure includes
      details about the spell, damage amount, school type, and any additional effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = Unit::GetPlayer();

      SpellNonMeleeDamage log;

      log.damage = 100;

      log.schoolMask = SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_fire;

      log.spellId = 12345;

      log.target = target;

      Unit::SendSpellNonMeleeDamageLog(&log);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the context of spell damage calculations
    and requires proper initialization of the SpellNonMeleeDamage structure before
    being sent. It may be called from various game mechanics contexts including periodic
    effects, direct damage spells, and damage over time effects.
  warnings: The method should only be called when the target player is valid and exists
    in the world. Incorrect usage can lead to client-side errors or unexpected behavior.
    Ensure that the log structure is properly initialized before calling this method.
