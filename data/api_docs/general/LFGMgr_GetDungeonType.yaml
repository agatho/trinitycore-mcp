  signature: LfgType LFGMgr::GetDungeonType(uint32 dungeon)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the LFG dungeon type for a given dungeon ID
  description: The GetDungeonType method retrieves the LfgType enumeration value associated
    with a specific dungeon identifier. This method is used internally by the LFG
    (Looking For Group) system to determine the type of dungeon (such as normal, heroic,
    or raid) based on its unique dungeon ID. The returned LfgType helps the system
    manage group matching, loot distribution, and other LFG-related mechanics that
    vary depending on the dungeon's difficulty and category. This method is typically
    called when processing player dungeon requests or when validating dungeon entries
    in the LFG system.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeon
    description: The unique identifier for a dungeon, typically obtained from the
      game's dungeon database or LFG system
  returns: Returns an LfgType enumeration value that represents the type of dungeon.
    Possible values include LFG_TYPE_DUNGEON, LFG_TYPE_RAID, LFG_TYPE_SCENARIO, etc.,
    depending on how the dungeon is categorized in the LFG system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 dungeonId = 1234;\nLfgType type = sLFGMgr->GetDungeonType(dungeonId);\n\
      if (type == LFG_TYPE_DUNGEON)\n{\n    // Handle normal dungeon\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Dungeon Type for Group Matching
    code: "void CheckAndMatchDungeon(uint32 dungeonId)\n{\n    LfgType type = sLFGMgr->GetDungeonType(dungeonId);\n\
      \    switch (type)\n    {\n        case LFG_TYPE_DUNGEON:\n            // Match\
      \ normal dungeon groups\n            break;\n        case LFG_TYPE_RAID:\n \
      \           // Handle raid group matching\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Unknown dungeon type\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core LFG system and should only be called with
    valid dungeon IDs that exist in the game's database. The method assumes that the
    dungeon ID has been validated before being passed to it, as invalid IDs may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect type assignments.
  warnings: Ensure that the dungeon parameter represents a valid dungeon ID from the
    game's database. Passing an invalid or non-existent dungeon ID could lead to incorrect
    LfgType values or system instability. This method should not be used outside of
    LFG-related contexts where dungeon types are required.
