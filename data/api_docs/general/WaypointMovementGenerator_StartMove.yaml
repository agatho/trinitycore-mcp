  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: StartMove
  signature: void WaypointMovementGenerator::StartMove(Creature * param0, bool relaunch)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates waypoint movement for a creature, optionally relaunching from the
    beginning if already in motion.
  description: The StartMove method begins or resumes waypoint-based movement for
    a Creature object. It is typically invoked when a creature needs to follow a predefined
    path of waypoints, often used for scripted behaviors such as patrol routes or
    quest-related movement. The method takes a pointer to the target creature and
    a boolean flag indicating whether to restart the movement from the first waypoint
    if it's already in progress. This functionality supports dynamic reinitialization
    of movement sequences without requiring a full reset of the AI state. The method
    operates within the context of TrinityCore's movement generator system, which
    manages how creatures navigate through the game world based on their assigned
    behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that will begin or resume waypoint
      movement. Must not be null.
  - name: relaunch
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to restart movement from the first
      waypoint if already in motion. If true, forces a reset; if false, continues
      current sequence.
  returns: None. This method performs an action and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Creature* npc = ...;

      waypointGenerator->StartMove(npc, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Force Restart Movement
    code: 'Creature* mob = ...;

      waypointGenerator->StartMove(mob, true); // Forces restart from first waypoint'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the WaypointMovementGenerator is properly initialized
    with a valid set of waypoints. The creature must be in a state where movement
    can be initiated (e.g., not dead or in an invalid AI state). Implementation may
    involve internal checks for existing movement states and adjustments to the creature's
    movement generator stack.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null Creature pointer will result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Ensure that the creature is valid and has a proper waypoint
    path assigned before invoking StartMove. Using relaunch=true when movement is
    not already active may lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.
