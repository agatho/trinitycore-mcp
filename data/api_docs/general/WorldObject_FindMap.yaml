documentation:
  brief: Returns the map object where the WorldObject is currently located.
  description: The FindMap method retrieves and returns a pointer to the Map object
    that contains the WorldObject. This method is essential for determining the current
    game map context of any WorldObject, whether it's a player, creature, or game
    object. The returned Map pointer can be used for various operations including
    checking map boundaries, accessing map-specific data, or performing map-related
    actions. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the object needs to interact
    with its map environment, such as when determining if an object is within a specific
    map's bounds or when accessing map-specific mechanics like instance maps.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Map object that contains this WorldObject. If
    the object is not currently on any map (e.g., in a non-interactive state), the
    method may return nullptr. The returned pointer is valid as long as the object
    exists and is located on a map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Map* map = this->FindMap();\nif (map)\n{\n    // Object is on a map\n \
      \   // Do something with the map\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Object is not on any map\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. Performance-wise,
    it's generally fast as it simply returns a cached pointer to the map object. The
    method relies on internal state tracking of the WorldObject's location within
    the game world.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned Map pointer, as it may be nullptr
    if the object is not currently located on any map. Always check for null before
    dereferencing the pointer to avoid crashes.
