  class: InterruptRotationManager
  method: CoordinateGroupInterrupts
  signature: void InterruptRotationManager::CoordinateGroupInterrupts(const int &
    casters)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates group interrupts for the specified caster count in the interrupt
    rotation manager.
  description: The CoordinateGroupInterrupts method manages the distribution and execution
    of interrupt abilities within a group context. It ensures that interrupts are
    properly coordinated among multiple casters, preventing conflicts and optimizing
    the use of interrupt cooldowns. This method is typically used in AI systems to
    manage group-based spell casting behaviors where multiple players or NPCs need
    to interrupt enemy targets simultaneously. The method likely handles synchronization
    of interrupt timing, target selection, and resource management across the group.
  parameters:
  - name: casters
    description: The number of casters in the group that will be coordinating interrupts.
      This parameter determines how many entities will participate in the interrupt
      coordination process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager manager;

      manager.CoordinateGroupInterrupts(3);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Group Size Example
    code: 'InterruptRotationManager manager;

      int groupSize = GetGroupMemberCount();

      manager.CoordinateGroupInterrupts(groupSize);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex AI decision-making for interrupt coordination,
    including target prioritization and cooldown management. It may interact with
    the TrinityCore's combat system to ensure proper interrupt timing and prevent
    conflicts between group members.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to interrupt conflicts or inefficient
    resource usage in group combat scenarios. Ensure that the caster count parameter
    accurately reflects the actual number of participating entities.
