  signature: void AuctionHouseBot::SetItemsRatioForHouse(AuctionHouseType house, uint32
    val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the item ratio for a specified auction house type.
  description: The SetItemsRatioForHouse method configures the ratio of items that
    will be listed in the auction house for a given auction house type. This setting
    influences how many items are generated or managed by the Auction House Bot for
    that specific house. The method takes an AuctionHouseType enum value and a uint32
    ratio value to define the behavior. It is typically used during initialization
    or configuration of the bot's auction house operations.
  parameters:
  - name: house
    description: The type of auction house to configure. This parameter specifies
      which auction house (e.g., Alliance, Horde, Neutral) the ratio settings will
      apply to.
  - name: val
    description: The ratio value to set for the specified auction house type. This
      is a numeric value that determines the proportion or count of items managed
      by the bot for that house.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Item Ratio for Alliance Auction House
    code: AuctionHouseBot::SetItemsRatioForHouse(AUCTION_HOUSE_ALLIANCE, 100);

  - title: Configure Ratios for All Auction Houses
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot::SetItemsRatioForHouse(AUCTION_HOUSE_ALLIANCE, 120);

      AuctionHouseBot::SetItemsRatioForHouse(AUCTION_HOUSE_HORDE, 80);

      AuctionHouseBot::SetItemsRatioForHouse(AUCTION_HOUSE_NEUTRAL, 100);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Auction House Bot system and affects how items
    are managed within the auction house. It should be called during initialization
