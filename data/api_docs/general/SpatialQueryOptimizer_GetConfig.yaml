  class: SpatialQueryOptimizer
  method: GetConfig
  signature: OptimizerConfig SpatialQueryOptimizer::GetConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current configuration settings of the spatial query optimizer.
  description: The GetConfig method returns a copy of the OptimizerConfig object that
    holds all current configuration parameters for the SpatialQueryOptimizer. This
    includes settings such as optimization thresholds, query types, and performance-related
    flags that control how spatial queries are processed and optimized within the
    TrinityCore environment. The returned configuration is read-only and does not
    affect the internal state of the optimizer. This method is typically used to inspect
    or log current optimization settings without modifying them.
  parameters: []
  returns: An OptimizerConfig object containing all current configuration parameters
    for the spatial query optimizer. The object includes settings that determine how
    queries are optimized, such as thresholds for query complexity, enabled optimization
    types, and performance tuning flags.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log current optimizer configuration
    code: 'SpatialQueryOptimizer optimizer;

      OptimizerConfig config = optimizer.GetConfig();

      TC_LOG_INFO("sql.sql", "Optimizer threshold: %f", config.threshold);

      TC_LOG_INFO("sql.sql", "Optimization enabled: %s", config.enableOptimization
      ? "true" : "false");'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned OptimizerConfig is a copy of the internal configuration, so
    modifications to it will not affect the actual optimizer settings. This method
    is thread-safe and can be called from any thread without locking concerns.
