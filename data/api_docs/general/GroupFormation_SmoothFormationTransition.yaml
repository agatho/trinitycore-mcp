  class: GroupFormation
  method: SmoothFormationTransition
  signature: void GroupFormation::SmoothFormationTransition(const int & newCenter,
    float newDirection)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a smooth transition to a new formation center and direction for
    the group.
  description: The SmoothFormationTransition method orchestrates a gradual movement
    of the group's formation to a specified center point and directional orientation.
    This method is typically used in group-based gameplay scenarios such as raid encounters
    or battlefield operations where coordinated positioning is essential. It ensures
    that all group members transition smoothly without abrupt changes in position,
    maintaining formation integrity during dynamic tactical shifts. The method operates
    on the current group's formation state and updates it based on the provided parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: newCenter
    description: The new center point for the group formation, represented as an integer
      identifier or coordinate value. This parameter defines where the group should
      move its central position.
  - name: newDirection
    description: The new directional orientation of the group formation, specified
      in radians. This determines the facing angle of the group's formation relative
      to the world coordinate system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Transition
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->SmoothFormationTransition(100, 1.57f); // Move to center 100, face
      east (90 degrees)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Formation Update
    code: "if (player->GetGroup()) {\n    GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\n\
      \    int newCenter = GetNextFormationPoint();\n    float newDirection = CalculateOptimalFacing();\n\
      \    formation->SmoothFormationTransition(newCenter, newDirection);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal animation or movement updates for all
    group members. It may be called during combat or non-combat scenarios and should
    only be invoked when the group has a valid formation assigned. The smooth transition
    is handled internally using interpolation techniques to avoid sudden jumps in
    positioning.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group without an active formation may result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the newCenter value corresponds to a valid
    location within the current map boundaries to prevent invalid formation states.
