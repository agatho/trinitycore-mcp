  signature: void CollectionMgr::LoadWarbandSceneDefinitions()
documentation:
  brief: Loads warband scene definitions from the database into memory for use in
    the CollectionMgr system.
  description: The LoadWarbandSceneDefinitions method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with warband scene configuration data retrieved from the database.
    This method is typically invoked during server startup or when the collection
    manager needs to refresh its warband scene data. It processes database entries
    related to warband scenes, including their visual properties, associated items,
    and gameplay mechanics. The loaded definitions are used by other methods within
    CollectionMgr to determine how warband scenes should be displayed and interacted
    with in the game world. This method ensures that all warband scene data is available
    for runtime operations without requiring repeated database queries.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CollectionMgr* mgr = sCollectionMgr;

      mgr->LoadWarbandSceneDefinitions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the relevant tables have been initialized. It performs a full reload of all
    warband scene definitions, which may cause temporary performance overhead during
    execution. The method assumes that the database schema for warband scenes is properly
    set up with required columns and constraints.
  warnings: Calling this method while active warband scenes are in use may lead to
    inconsistent behavior or visual glitches. It should be avoided during active gameplay
    sessions unless absolutely necessary. The method does not handle database connection
    failures gracefully, so proper error handling should be implemented upstream.
