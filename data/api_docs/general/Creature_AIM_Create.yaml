documentation:
  brief: Initializes and assigns a CreatureAI instance to the creature, enabling AI
    behavior.
  description: The AIM_Create method is responsible for creating and assigning a CreatureAI
    instance to a Creature object. This method sets up the AI framework that governs
    how the creature behaves in the game world, including movement patterns, combat
    actions, and interaction with players or other entities. It typically gets called
    during creature creation or when transitioning between different AI states. The
    method ensures that the creature's AI system is properly initialized before any
    AI-related operations can occur. This is a critical part of the creature's lifecycle
    in TrinityCore's AI architecture.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI instance was successfully created and assigned to
    the creature; otherwise, returns false if the operation failed due to invalid
    parameters or system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Creation for a Custom Creature
    code: "class MyCustomCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    explicit MyCustomCreatureAI(Creature*\
      \ creature) : CreatureAI(creature) {}\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\
      \ {\n        // Custom AI logic\n    }\n};\n\n// In creature creation code:\n\
      MyCustomCreatureAI* ai = new MyCustomCreatureAI(creature);\nbool success = creature->AIM_Create(ai);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per creature instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior. The AI object passed
    must be properly allocated and managed by the caller.
  warnings: Do not call this method on creatures that are already initialized with
    an AI, as it may result in resource leaks or crashes. Ensure proper memory management
    of the AI instance being passed to avoid double deletion issues.
