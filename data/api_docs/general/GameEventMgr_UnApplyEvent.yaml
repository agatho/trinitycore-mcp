  class: GameEventMgr
  method: UnApplyEvent
  signature: void GameEventMgr::UnApplyEvent(uint16 event_id)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all game event effects and modifications associated with the specified
    event ID from the world.
  description: The UnApplyEvent method is responsible for reverting all changes made
    by a specific game event. When called, it removes any active event modifications
    such as creature spawns, game object placements, quest additions, or other event-related
    alterations that were previously applied to the game world. This function ensures
    that when an event ends, its effects are properly cleaned up and removed from
    the server state. The method operates on a single event identified by its unique
    event_id parameter and does not affect any other active events or ongoing gameplay
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to be unapplied. This corresponds
      to the event's ID in the game_event table and must reference a previously applied
      event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Unapply a specific game event
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->UnApplyEvent(42);
    language: cpp
  - title: Clean up holiday event effects
    code: "if (sGameEventMgr->IsActiveEvent(101))\n{\n    sGameEventMgr->UnApplyEvent(101);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when a game event concludes to properly clean
    up all temporary modifications. It is typically invoked automatically by the GameEventMgr
    system when an event's end time is reached, but can also be manually triggered
    for immediate cleanup. The method does not affect permanent world state changes
    or player data.
  warnings: Calling this method on an event that has not been applied may result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the event_id corresponds to a valid and currently
    active event before calling this function. Improper use can lead to inconsistent
    game state or missing event effects.
