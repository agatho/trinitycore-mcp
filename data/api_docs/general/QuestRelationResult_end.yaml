documentation:
  brief: Returns an iterator pointing to the end of the quest relation collection.
  description: The QuestRelationResult::end() method provides access to the end iterator
    of the quest relation container, which is typically used in range-based for loops
    or when iterating through quest relations. This method allows developers to traverse
    the collection of quest relations associated with a specific object (such as a
    player or NPC) and determine where the valid range ends. The returned iterator
    is const, meaning it cannot be used to modify elements in the collection. This
    method is commonly used in conjunction with begin() to define iteration boundaries
    for processing quest data within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: An Iterator pointing to the position after the last element in the quest
    relation collection. This iterator serves as the upper bound for iterating through
    the collection and should not be dereferenced directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic iteration through quest relations
    code: "for (auto it = player->GetQuestRelations().begin(); it != player->GetQuestRelations().end();\
      \ ++it)\n{\n    QuestRelation const* relation = *it;\n    // Process each quest\
      \ relation\n    sLog->outString(\"Processing quest relation for quest ID: %u\"\
      , relation->questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using range-based for loop with end() iterator
    code: "auto const& relations = player->GetQuestRelations();\nfor (auto it = relations.begin();\
      \ it != relations.end(); ++it)\n{\n    if (it->IsComplete())\n    {\n      \
      \  // Handle completed quest relation\n        sLog->outString(\"Found completed\
      \ quest: %u\", it->questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned iterator is a const iterator, which means attempting to modify
    elements through this iterator will result in compilation errors. The method itself
    is lightweight and does not perform any expensive operations. When using the end()
    iterator, ensure that it is compared against the begin() iterator or another valid
    iterator from the same container to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not dereference the returned iterator directly as it points to one
    past the last element. Using an invalid iterator or comparing iterators from different
    containers may lead to undefined behavior. When implementing custom iteration
    logic, always ensure that the end() iterator is properly used in comparison with
    begin() to avoid off-by-one errors.
