  brief: Moves data from a source UpdateData object to this UpdateData object, effectively
    transferring ownership of its internal data structures.
  description: The UpdateData::UpdateData(UpdateData&& right) method is a move constructor
    that transfers the internal data and state from another UpdateData object to the
    current instance. This operation is typically used to efficiently transfer ownership
    of resources without performing expensive deep copies. The source UpdateData object
    becomes invalid after this operation and should not be used. In the context of
    TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation, this constructor is commonly
    utilized when managing object updates for players and creatures in the game world,
    particularly during network packet construction and transmission. This move semantics
    approach helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations
    and data copying when passing UpdateData objects between functions or containers.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'UpdateData sourceData;

      // ... populate sourceData with update information ...

      UpdateData newData = std::move(sourceData); // Move constructor called here

      // sourceData is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<UpdateData> updateQueue;

      UpdateData data1, data2;

      // ... populate data1 and data2 ...

      updateQueue.push_back(std::move(data1)); // Move data1 into vector

      updateQueue.emplace_back(std::move(data2)); // Move data2 into vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a regular copy constructor. After calling
    this constructor, the source object should be considered invalid and any further
    operations on it may result in undefined behavior. The implementation leverages
    C++11 move semantics for efficient resource transfer. This method is particularly
    important in performance-critical sections of TrinityCore's update system where
    minimizing memory allocations and copying is essential.
  warnings: Do not use the source UpdateData object after moving its contents to another
    instance. Attempting to access or modify the moved-from object will result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that all references to the source object are invalidated
    immediately after this operation.
