  class: BotAI
  method: GetEventDispatcher
  signature: const Events::EventDispatcher * BotAI::GetEventDispatcher() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the event dispatcher instance used by the bot AI for handling asynchronous
    events and callbacks.
  description: The GetEventDispatcher method provides access to the internal EventDispatcher
    object that manages event handling within the BotAI system. This dispatcher is
    responsible for processing various asynchronous events such as timer callbacks,
    AI decision-making triggers, and communication with other subsystems. The returned
    pointer is constant, indicating that the dispatcher should not be modified through
    this interface. This method is typically used by bot AI components to register
    event handlers or schedule timed actions without directly managing the dispatcher
    lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the Events::EventDispatcher instance associated with
    this BotAI object. The returned pointer will never be null in normal operation,
    but callers should verify its validity before use if there's any chance the BotAI
    instance might not be fully initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Event Dispatcher for Registration
    code: "void MyBotAI::Initialize()\n{\n    const Events::EventDispatcher* dispatcher\
      \ = GetEventDispatcher();\n    if (dispatcher)\n    {\n        // Register a\
      \ timer event\n        dispatcher->ScheduleEvent([this]() {\n            HandleBotAction();\n\
      \        }, 5000); // 5 second delay\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The EventDispatcher returned by this method is owned and managed by the BotAI
    instance. Do not attempt to delete or destroy the returned pointer. The dispatcher
    may be reinitialized during certain AI state transitions, though this behavior
    should be verified in the specific implementation.
  warnings: While the returned pointer is const, the underlying EventDispatcher object
    can still be modified through other interfaces. Ensure thread safety when accessing
    the dispatcher from multiple contexts if the bot AI is used in a multi-threaded
    environment.
