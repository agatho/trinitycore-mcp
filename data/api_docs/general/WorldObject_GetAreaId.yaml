api:
  class: WorldObject
  method: GetAreaId
  signature: uint32 WorldObject::GetAreaId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the area ID where the WorldObject is located.
  description: The GetAreaId method returns the unique identifier for the area or
    zone where the WorldObject currently resides. This value represents the areaID
    that is used to determine the geographical context of the object within the game
    world. The method is typically used for determining which area a player or NPC
    is in, and can be crucial for various game mechanics including quest triggering,
    area-based events, and zone-based interactions. It is important to note that this
    value may change as the object moves between different zones or areas.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the area ID where the WorldObject currently
    resides. This value corresponds to the areaID in the game database and can be
    used to determine the geographical context of the object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'uint32 areaId = worldObject->GetAreaId();

      // areaId now contains the area ID of the current position'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WorldObject class and is commonly used in conjunction
    with other location-based methods like GetZoneId or GetMapId. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this method simply retrieves a stored value from the object's internal
    data structure.
  warnings: The area ID returned by this method may not always reflect the current
    zone if the object is moving between areas, and should be used carefully in scenarios
    where precise location tracking is required.
