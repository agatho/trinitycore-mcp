  brief: Unlocks all default azerite milestones for the item.
  description: The UnlockDefaultMilestones method enables all default azerite milestones
    associated with the AzeriteItem. This function typically sets the state of all
    default milestones to unlocked, allowing players to access azerite powers and
    abilities that are normally restricted until certain conditions are met. The method
    operates on the internal milestone tracking system of the item and does not require
    any parameters. It is commonly used during item initialization or when granting
    full azerite progression to a player's gear.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Unlocking Default Milestones for an Azerite Item
    code: "AzeriteItem* item = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);\nif (item)\n{\n    item->UnlockDefaultMilestones();\n\
      \    // All default azerite milestones are now unlocked\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the AzeriteItem and may trigger
    UI updates or notifications to the player. It should only be called when the item
    is fully initialized and ready for milestone manipulation.
  warnings: Calling this method on an item that is not properly initialized may result
    in undefined behavior or client-side errors. Ensure the item's azerite data is
    valid before invoking this function.
