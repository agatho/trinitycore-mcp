  method: GetFlags
  signature: int ChrRacesEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bitmask associated with the character race entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing a bitmask
    of flags that define various properties and characteristics of the character race.
    These flags are typically used by the game engine to determine race-specific behaviors,
    restrictions, or visual settings. The returned value can be combined with bitwise
    operations to check for specific flag states. This method is commonly used in
    player creation, race selection logic, and gameplay mechanics that depend on racial
    traits.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of flags associated with this character
    race. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific property or characteristic
    of the race, such as whether it supports certain abilities, has special visual
    effects, or is restricted in specific game modes.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a race has a specific flag
    code: "ChrRacesEntry* raceEntry = sChrRacesStore.LookupEntry(1); // Human\nint\
      \ flags = raceEntry->GetFlags();\nif (flags & RACE_FLAG_CAN_MOUNT)\n{\n    //\
      \ Human can mount\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using flags to determine race capabilities
    code: "ChrRacesEntry* entry = sChrRacesStore.LookupEntry(player->getRace());\n\
      int raceFlags = entry->GetFlags();\nif (raceFlags & RACE_FLAG_NO_MOUNT)\n{\n\
      \    // This race cannot use mounts\n    player->SendNotification(\"This race\
      \ cannot use mounts.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are defined in the game's database and
    correspond to predefined constants such as RACE_FLAG_CAN_MOUNT, RACE_FLAG_NO_MOUNT,
    etc. These values are typically loaded from the ChrRaces.dbc file or equivalent
    data structure in TrinityCore. The bitmask system allows for efficient storage
    and checking of multiple boolean properties using a single integer value.
  warnings: Be aware that flag values may vary between different versions of TrinityCore
    or custom modifications to the game data. Always validate that your flag checks
    are compatible with the specific version of the core you're working with. Also,
    bitwise operations should be used carefully to avoid unintended behavior when
    checking multiple flags simultaneously.
