documentation:
  brief: Handles player interaction when selecting options from a game object's gossip
    menu
  description: The OnGossipSelect method is invoked when a player selects an option
    from a GameObject's gossip menu. This method allows developers to define custom
    behavior in response to player choices, such as triggering quests, opening new
    menus, or performing actions like teleporting the player. It is part of the GameObjectAI
    system and integrates with TrinityCore's gossip framework to enable interactive
    game object interactions. The method returns true if the interaction was handled
    successfully and false otherwise, indicating whether further processing should
    occur.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object who selected the gossip option
  - name: param1
    description: The menu ID of the gossip menu from which the selection was made
  - name: param2
    description: The specific option index within the gossip menu that was selected
  returns: Returns true if the gossip selection was handled successfully and no further
    processing is needed; returns false if the default behavior should be executed
    or if an error occurred during handling.

      \        }\n    }\n    else if (sender == 2)\n    {\n        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendCloseGossip();\n\
      \        // Trigger quest completion or reward logic here\n    }\n    return\
      \ true;\n}"

  notes: This method is called within the context of a player's interaction with a
    GameObject. It should not be used to perform long-running operations as it may
    block the game loop. Ensure that all interactions are handled efficiently and
    that proper checks are made for player state or quest conditions before performing
    actions.
  warnings: Do not call methods that modify the player's state directly without checking
    if they are valid; always verify that the player exists and is in a valid state
    before proceeding. Returning false may cause unexpected behavior if default handling
    is required.
