documentation:
  brief: Initiates a power regeneration event for a specified player and resource
    type
  description: The PowerRegen method creates and returns a ResourceEvent object that
    represents a power regeneration action for a given player. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to manage resource regeneration such as
    mana, rage, or energy for players. The event can be scheduled or executed immediately
    depending on how it's handled by the game engine. It allows for precise control
    over when and how player resources regenerate, which is essential for implementing
    class-specific abilities, passive regen mechanics, and spell effects that modify
    resource recovery rates.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose power will be regenerated.
      Must correspond to a valid player object in the game world.
  - name: type
    description: The type of power to regenerate, specified as a Powers enum value
      (e.g., POWER_MANA, POWER_RAGE, POWER_ENERGY). Determines which resource pool
      is affected.
  - name: amt
    description: The amount of power to regenerate. Can be positive (adding power)
      or negative (removing power). Negative values may be used for power loss effects
      such as spell costs or damage.
  returns: A ResourceEvent object representing the power regeneration event that was
    initiated. This object can be further processed, scheduled, or executed by the
    game's event system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Power Regeneration
    code: ResourceEvent event = ResourceEvent::PowerRegen(playerGuid, POWER_MANA,
      100);
    language: cpp
  - title: Energy Loss for Spell Casting
    code: ResourceEvent event = ResourceEvent::PowerRegen(playerGuid, POWER_ENERGY,
      -50);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly modify the player's resource values; instead,
    it creates an event that can be processed by the game engine. The actual regeneration
    or depletion occurs when the ResourceEvent is executed through the appropriate
    event handling system. Developers should ensure proper synchronization when dealing
    with concurrent access to player resources.
  warnings: Improper use of negative amounts may result in invalid resource states
    (e.g., negative mana). Always validate that the player GUID corresponds to an
    active player object before calling this method. Be cautious about calling this
    method outside of appropriate game update contexts as it may not behave as expected
    in asynchronous environments.
