  class: PathfindingManager
  method: TrackPerformance
  signature: void PathfindingManager::TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds duration,
    bool successful, bool cached)
documentation:
  brief: Records pathfinding performance metrics including duration, success status,
    and cache usage for analytical purposes.
  description: The TrackPerformance method is used to log timing and outcome data
    for pathfinding operations within the TrinityCore server. It captures how long
    a pathfinding request took to complete, whether it was successful, and if the
    result came from a cached source. This information is crucial for performance
    monitoring, debugging, and optimizing AI behavior in World of Warcraft environments.
    The method does not return any value but contributes to internal statistics tracking
    that can be accessed via server tools or debug interfaces. It's typically called
    after pathfinding computations are finished, either by the PathfindingManager
    itself or by systems that utilize pathfinding services.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The time taken to complete the pathfinding operation, measured in
      microseconds. This value represents the actual computational time spent processing
      the request.
  - name: successful
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the pathfinding operation completed
      successfully. True means a valid path was found and returned; false indicates
      failure or no path available.
  - name: cached
    description: A boolean flag indicating if the result was retrieved from a cached
      path instead of being computed fresh. True means a previously calculated path
      was reused, which improves performance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Pathfinding Completion
    code: "void SomeAI::OnPathComplete(PathResult result) {\n    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now()\
      \ - m_startTime);\n    sPathfindingManager->TrackPerformance(duration, result.success,\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Cached Pathfinding Results
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateMovement() {\n    if (m_cachedPath) {\n        auto\
      \ duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now()\
      \ - m_lastPathTime);\n        sPathfindingManager->TrackPerformance(duration,\
      \ true, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with performance profiling tools
    or debug logging systems to monitor pathfinding efficiency. It may aggregate data
    into internal statistics structures that are periodically dumped or exposed through
    server commands for developers to analyze AI behavior and resource usage.
