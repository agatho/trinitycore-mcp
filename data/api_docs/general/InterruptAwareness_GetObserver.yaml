  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: GetObserver
  signature: Player * InterruptAwareness::GetObserver() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Player object that is currently observing or tracking an interruptible
    event.
  description: The GetObserver method retrieves a pointer to the Player object that
    is actively monitoring or has been designated as the observer of an interruptible
    action within the game context. This is typically used in systems where player
    actions can be interrupted by external events, such as spell casting being disrupted
    by damage or movement. The returned Player pointer may be null if no observer
    is currently assigned to the interrupt-aware system. This method does not modify
    any internal state and provides read-only access to the current observer reference.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object that is currently acting as the observer,
    or nullptr if no observer has been set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "InterruptAwareness awareness;\nPlayer* observer = awareness.GetObserver();\n\
      if (observer)\n{\n    // Process the observer player\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Current observer: %s\", observer->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Observer Before Action
    code: "InterruptAwareness awareness;\nPlayer* observer = awareness.GetObserver();\n\
      if (observer && observer->IsInWorld())\n{\n    // Proceed with interrupt-related\
      \ logic\n    observer->SendSpellLogExecute(0, 12345);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ case where no valid observer exists\n    sLog->outString(\"No valid observer\
      \ found for interrupt awareness.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other interrupt-aware mechanisms
    such as spell interruption handling or combat state tracking. The returned Player
    pointer should not be stored long-term as it may become invalid if the observer
    leaves the game world or is otherwise removed from the system.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned Player pointer directly without checking
    for null, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause a crash. Also note that the
    observer might not always represent the active caster or user of an interruptible
    action, but rather the entity tracking or managing the interruption state.
