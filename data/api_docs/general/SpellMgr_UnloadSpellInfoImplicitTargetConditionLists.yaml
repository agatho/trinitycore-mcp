documentation:
  brief: Clears all implicit target condition lists from spell information in the
    SpellMgr.
  description: The UnloadSpellInfoImplicitTargetConditionLists method removes and
    deallocates all implicit target condition data associated with spells within the
    SpellMgr. This function is typically invoked during spell data reloading or shutdown
    sequences to ensure that stale condition references are cleared from memory. It
    helps prevent memory leaks and ensures clean state management when spell information
    is reloaded or the system shuts down. The method operates on internal data structures
    containing condition lists that define how spell targets are implicitly handled
    based on various game mechanics such as line-of-sight, target type restrictions,
    or environmental constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Shutdown
    code: "void World::Shutdown()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->UnloadSpellInfoImplicitTargetConditionLists();\n\
      \    // Other shutdown logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when it's safe to clear spell data, typically
    during server shutdown or reload operations. It is not thread-safe and should
    be executed in a synchronized context if multiple threads access the SpellMgr.
  warnings: Calling this method while spells are actively being cast or processed
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all spell operations have completed
    before invoking this function.
