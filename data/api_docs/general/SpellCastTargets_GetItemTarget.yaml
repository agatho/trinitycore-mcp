  method: GetItemTarget
  signature: Item * SpellCastTargets::GetItemTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the item target associated with the spell cast.
  description: The GetItemTarget method returns a pointer to the Item object that
    serves as the target for the spell being cast. This is typically used when a spell
    requires an item as its target, such as enchanting or consuming items. The method
    provides access to the item's properties and data during spell execution. It is
    important to note that this method may return nullptr if no valid item target
    exists in the spell cast targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Item object that is the target of the spell, or nullptr
    if there is no item target specified.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Item Target in Spell Logic
    code: "void MySpellEffect(Unit* caster, Unit* target)\n{\n    SpellCastTargets\
      \ targets = caster->GetSpellCastTargets();\n    Item* itemTarget = targets.GetItemTarget();\n\
      \    if (itemTarget != nullptr)\n    {\n        // Process the item target\n\
      \        uint32 itemId = itemTarget->GetEntry();\n        // ... perform spell\
      \ effects on the item\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellCastTargets class which manages all targets
    for a spell cast. The returned Item pointer is valid only during the spell's execution
    context and should not be stored for later use. Ensure proper null checking before
    using the returned item pointer.
  warnings: Always check if the returned Item pointer is not nullptr before attempting
    to access its members, as spells may not always have an item target. Using the
    returned pointer after the spell execution has ended results in undefined behavior.
