  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: ~LeaderFollowBehavior
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::~LeaderFollowBehavior()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LeaderFollowBehavior instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LeaderFollowBehavior class is responsible for
    releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the behavior instance.
    This method is automatically invoked when an object of type LeaderFollowBehavior
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, this behavior is typically used by AI-controlled creatures that follow
    a designated leader, such as pets or summoned minions. The destructor ensures
    proper cleanup of internal data structures and prevents memory leaks during the
    destruction of AI behavior components.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = new LeaderFollowBehavior();\n\
      \    // ... use behavior ...\n    delete behavior; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocation
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    LeaderFollowBehavior behavior;\n    // Destructor\
      \ automatically called when behavior goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived classes. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless
    performing explicit memory management. The behavior's internal state should be
    considered invalid after destruction.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly on stack-allocated objects; it will
    be invoked automatically. Avoid double-deleting objects that have already been
    destroyed.
