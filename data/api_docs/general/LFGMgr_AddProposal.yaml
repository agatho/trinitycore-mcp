  method: AddProposal
  signature: uint32 LFGMgr::AddProposal(LfgProposal & proposal)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new LFG proposal and returns its unique identifier.
  description: The AddProposal method is responsible for creating and registering
    a new Looking For Group (LFG) proposal within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method takes an existing LfgProposal object as input, processes it, and assigns
    it a unique identifier that can be used to reference the proposal later. The proposal
    typically contains information about group composition, dungeon requirements,
    and player preferences. This method is essential for managing group formation
    and coordination in World of Warcraft's LFG system.
  parameters:
  - name: proposal
    description: Reference to an LfgProposal object containing the group formation
      details including players, dungeon information, and group type.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier assigned to the
    newly created proposal. This ID can be used to track, retrieve, or manage the
    proposal throughout its lifecycle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proposal Creation
    code: "LfgProposal newProposal;\n// ... populate proposal with data ...\nuint32\
      \ proposalId = sLFGMgr->AddProposal(newProposal);\nif (proposalId != 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Proposal successfully created\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"lfg\", \"New LFG proposal\
      \ created with ID: %u\", proposalId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LFG system when players
    form groups or when a new group needs to be proposed for a dungeon. The returned
    identifier should be stored for future reference, as it's required for other LFG
    operations like accepting or rejecting proposals.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided proposal object is valid and properly
    initialized. Passing an invalid or uninitialized LfgProposal may result in undefined
    behavior or system errors. Always ensure proper validation before calling this
    method.
