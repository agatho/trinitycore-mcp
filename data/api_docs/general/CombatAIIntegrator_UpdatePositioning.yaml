  method: UpdatePositioning
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::UpdatePositioning(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the positioning logic for combat AI entities based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdatePositioning method is responsible for managing and updating
    the positional behavior of AI-controlled units during combat scenarios. It processes
    movement-related decisions, such as maintaining optimal distance from targets,
    adjusting positioning for line-of-sight, or performing tactical repositioning.
    This method is typically called within the AI update loop and uses a time delta
    (diff) to ensure smooth and consistent movement calculations. The method may also
    handle pathfinding updates, obstacle avoidance, or positioning adjustments based
    on combat state changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CombatAIIntegrator::Update()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTimeDiff(m_lastUpdate,\
      \ getMSTime());\n    UpdatePositioning(diff);\n    m_lastUpdate = getMSTime();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly within the AI update cycle.
    It's important that the time delta (diff) passed to this function accurately reflects
    the elapsed game time for consistent behavior. The method may internally utilize
    pathfinding and movement handlers from the core TrinityCore engine.
