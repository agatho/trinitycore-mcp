documentation:
  brief: Executes a purge operation to remove all dispellable effects from units within
    the coordinator's scope
  description: The ExecutePurge method performs a comprehensive cleanup operation
    that removes all dispellable buffs, debuffs, and aura effects from affected units.
    This method is typically invoked during specific game events or when a dispel
    coordinator needs to reset its target state. The purge operation respects dispel
    resistance and type restrictions, ensuring only applicable auras are removed.
    It returns true if the operation was successful and at least one effect was removed,
    or false if no effects were found to purge or if the operation failed for any
    reason.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the purge operation successfully removed at least one dispellable
    effect from target units, or false if no effects were found to purge or if the
    operation encountered an error during execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Purge Execution
    code: "DispelCoordinator coordinator;\nbool success = coordinator.ExecutePurge();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Purge was successful, effects were removed\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Purge operation completed successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No effects to\
      \ purge or operation failed\n    sLog->outString(\"Purge operation returned\
      \ no results.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when dealing with large numbers
    of units or complex aura states. It's recommended to use this method judiciously
    during high-frequency operations. The purge operation is typically thread-safe
    but should be called from the appropriate game thread context.
  warnings: Calling ExecutePurge on a coordinator without properly initialized targets
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure all target units are valid and within
    scope before invoking this method.
