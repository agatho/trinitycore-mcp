  class: BotAIFactory
  method: InitializeClassStrategies
  signature: void BotAIFactory::InitializeClassStrategies(BotAI * ai, uint8 classId,
    uint8 spec)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes class-specific AI strategies for a bot based on its class and
    specialization.
  description: The InitializeClassStrategies method configures the AI behavior of
    a bot by setting up appropriate strategy objects tailored to the bot's class and
    spec. This method is typically called during bot creation or when a bot's class
    changes, ensuring that the AI has the correct set of strategies to execute actions
    relevant to the specified class and specialization. It integrates with the broader
    BotAI system to provide class-specific decision-making logic, such as spell selection,
    target prioritization, and combat behavior. The method does not return any value
    but modifies the internal state of the provided BotAI instance.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will have its strategies initialized.
      Must be a valid pointer to an existing BotAI object.
  - name: classId
    description: The class identifier of the bot (e.g., WARRIOR, MAGE, PRIEST). Valid
      values are defined by the TrinityCore class constants.
  - name: spec
    description: The specialization index of the bot. For example, for a Mage, this
      could represent Arcane, Fire, or Frost spec. Value depends on the class and
      is typically 0-2 for most classes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize AI for a Warrior Bot
    code: 'BotAI* ai = new BotAI();

      uint8 classId = CLASS_WARRIOR;

      uint8 spec = SPEC_PROTECTION;

      BotAIFactory::InitializeClassStrategies(ai, classId, spec);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize AI for a Mage Bot with Fire Spec
    code: 'BotAI* ai = GetBotAI();

      uint8 classId = CLASS_MAGE;

      uint8 spec = SPEC_FIRE;

      BotAIFactory::InitializeClassStrategies(ai, classId, spec);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI instance is already constructed and valid.
    It relies on internal strategy mappings defined in the BotAIFactory to assign
    appropriate strategies based on class and spec. The method may be called multiple
    times if a bot's class or specialization changes during runtime.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid classId or spec value can lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect AI behavior. Ensure that the provided parameters
    are valid before calling this function.
