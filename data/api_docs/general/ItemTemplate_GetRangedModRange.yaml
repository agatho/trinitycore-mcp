  signature: float ItemTemplate::GetRangedModRange() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the ranged modifier range value for the item template.
  description: The GetRangedModRange method retrieves a floating-point value that
    represents the ranged attack power modifier range associated with an item template.
    This value is typically used in the context of weapon statistics and affects how
    ranged attacks are calculated for items such as bows, guns, or other ranged weapons.
    The returned value may influence the damage scaling or accuracy of ranged attacks
    depending on the specific implementation within TrinityCore's item system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the ranged modifier range for the item template.
    This value is usually a positive number that defines the range of variation or
    scaling factor applied to ranged attack power calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use ranged modifier range
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate)\n\
      {\n    float rangedModRange = itemTemplate->GetRangedModRange();\n    // Use\
      \ rangedModRange in calculations or logging\n    sLog->outString(\"Ranged modifier\
      \ range for item %u is %.2f\", itemTemplate->ItemId, rangedModRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ItemTemplate class which holds static data about
    items. It should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as it accesses
    cached item template data. The value returned may vary depending on the item's
    type and its specific properties defined in the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the ItemTemplate pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. This method does not perform any validation on the
    internal data, so relying on unexpected values might lead to incorrect gameplay
    mechanics.
