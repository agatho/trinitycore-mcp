  signature: const JournalTierEntry * DB2Manager::GetJournalTier(uint32 index) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a journal tier entry by its index from the DB2 database.
  description: The GetJournalTier method fetches a specific JournalTierEntry object
    from the internal DB2 manager storage using the provided index. This method is
    typically used to access structured data related to in-game journal tiers, such
    as those found in the World of Warcraft Adventure Guide or similar systems. The
    returned pointer provides access to the tier's properties including its ID, name,
    and associated rewards. The method performs no validation on the input index,
    so callers must ensure that the index is within valid bounds to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a JournalTierEntry object if the index is valid and
    an entry exists; otherwise, returns nullptr if the index is out of range or no
    data is loaded for that index.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const JournalTierEntry* tier = sDB2Manager->GetJournalTier(5);\nif (tier)\n\
      {\n    // Use tier->Id, tier->Name, etc.\n    printf(\"Tier ID: %u\\n\", tier->Id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the DB2 files have been properly loaded and parsed
    into memory. It is intended for read-only access to preloaded data, so performance
    should be consistent once the database is initialized. The returned pointer is
    only valid as long as the DB2Manager instance remains alive.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid index may result in undefined behavior
    or a crash. Always validate that the index is within the expected range before
    calling this method. Additionally, do not modify the returned JournalTierEntry
    object as it's marked const.
