documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the VMapManager2 class for managing virtual
    map navigation meshes.
  description: The VMapManager2 constructor initializes the virtual map manager responsible
    for handling navigation meshes in the game world. This manager is crucial for
    pathfinding and movement calculations for creatures and players within the TrinityCore
    emulator. It sets up internal data structures needed to load, manage, and query
    virtual maps that define walkable areas, obstacles, and other navigational data.
    The constructor typically prepares the system to handle map tile loading and caching
    operations required for efficient navigation queries during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a VMapManager2 instance
    code: 'VMapManager2* vmapManager = new VMapManager2();

      // The manager is now initialized and ready to handle map navigation data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once during server initialization.
    The VMapManager2 instance manages memory for loaded maps and should be properly
    cleaned up when the server shuts down. It's typically instantiated as a global
    singleton within TrinityCore's core systems.
