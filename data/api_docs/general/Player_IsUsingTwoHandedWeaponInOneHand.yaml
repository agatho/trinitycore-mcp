  signature: bool Player::IsUsingTwoHandedWeaponInOneHand() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently using a two-handed weapon in their
    main hand.
  description: This method checks if the player's main hand weapon is a two-handed
    weapon, which affects gameplay mechanics such as attack speed and damage calculations.
    It returns true when the player is wielding a two-handed weapon in their main
    hand, and false otherwise. This method is commonly used in combat scenarios to
    determine weapon type for calculating damage and attack speed, particularly in
    conjunction with other weapon-related methods like IsUsingTwoHandedWeaponInOffHand
    or IsUsingOneHandedWeaponInOneHand.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's main hand weapon is a two-handed weapon, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the player is currently using a two-handed weapon
    in their main hand for combat purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsUsingTwoHandedWeaponInOneHand()) {\n    // Player is wielding\
      \ a two-handed weapon\n    // Perform appropriate actions for two-handed weapon\
      \ usage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current equipped weapon in their main
    hand. It may be affected by weapon switching or temporary effects like buffs/debuffs
    that alter weapon type. Performance-wise, this is a lightweight check that does
    not involve complex calculations.
  warnings: This method only checks the main hand weapon; it does not consider off-hand
    weapons or other weapon types. Be aware that the method may return false even
    if the player is wielding a two-handed weapon in their off-hand, as it specifically
    checks for main hand usage.
