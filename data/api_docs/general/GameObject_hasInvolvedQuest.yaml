documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the GameObject has a specific quest involved.
  description: The hasInvolvedQuest method checks if a specified quest ID is associated
    with the GameObject. This method is commonly used in quest-related logic to verify
    if a GameObject is involved in a particular quest, which helps determine if the
    GameObject should be interacted with or if it's part of the quest objectives.
    It's typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods to manage
    quest progression and completion.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject has the specified quest ID involved, false
    otherwise. The method returns false when the quest ID is not associated with the
    GameObject.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (gameobject->hasInvolvedQuest(12345)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (gameobject->hasInvolvedQuest(questId)) {\n    // Check if quest is\
      \ active\n    // Perform actions based on quest status\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks the GameObject's quest involvement through internal
    data structures. It's important to note that this method does not verify if a
    player has completed the quest, but rather whether the GameObject is involved
    in the quest. Performance considerations include avoiding frequent calls to this
    method during quest processing loops.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return false positives or
    negatives if the quest data is not properly initialized or updated. Also, ensure
    that the quest ID passed is valid and exists within the game's quest database.
