  method: DetectEnvironmentalHazards
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::DetectEnvironmentalHazards(const DetectionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Detects and evaluates environmental hazards in the current game context for
    obstacle avoidance.
  description: The DetectEnvironmentalHazards method analyzes the surrounding environment
    to identify potential hazards that could impede movement or cause damage. It evaluates
    factors such as terrain, obstacles, and environmental effects within the detection
    context. This method is typically used by AI-controlled entities to make informed
    decisions about pathfinding and movement strategies. The method returns a numerical
    value indicating the severity or presence of detected hazards, which can be used
    to adjust behavior or trigger avoidance actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the hazard level or detection status.
    A value of 0 typically indicates no hazards detected, while positive values indicate
    increasing levels of environmental danger or complexity requiring avoidance behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hazard Detection
    code: "ObstacleAvoidanceManager avoidanceManager;\nDetectionContext context;\n\
      int hazardLevel = avoidanceManager.DetectEnvironmentalHazards(context);\nif\
      \ (hazardLevel > 0) {\n    // Implement avoidance behavior\n    player->MoveToSafeLocation();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs expensive spatial queries and should be called
    judiciously to avoid performance degradation. The detection context parameter
    is expected to contain relevant positioning and environmental data for accurate
    hazard assessment.
  warnings: The method may return different values based on the current game state
    and environment, so results should not be cached without proper invalidation logic.
    Improper handling of the returned value could lead to incorrect avoidance behavior
    or movement failures.
