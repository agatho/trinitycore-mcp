  brief: Updates the player's mana regeneration rate based on current state and game
    mechanics
  description: The UpdateManaRegen method recalculates and applies the player's current
    mana regeneration rate. This includes considering factors such as player's class,
    equipped items, buffs/debuffs, stance, and whether the player is in combat or
    resting. The method ensures that the player's mana regen values are accurately
    updated to reflect their current game state. It typically gets called automatically
    by the game engine during various events like entering/exiting combat, changing
    stances, or when buff/debuff timers expire.

    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateManaRegen();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the TrinityCore server logic
    in response to game events. Developers should not typically need to call this
    method manually unless implementing custom game mechanics or debugging mana-related
    systems.
