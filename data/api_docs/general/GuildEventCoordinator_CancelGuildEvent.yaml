  signature: bool GuildEventCoordinator::CancelGuildEvent(int * organizer, uint32
    eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Cancels a guild event identified by its event ID if the organizer matches
    the provided pointer.
  description: The CancelGuildEvent method attempts to cancel a guild event within
    the GuildEventCoordinator system. It takes an optional organizer pointer and a
    unique event identifier to locate and remove the specified guild event from the
    coordinator's active events list. The method ensures that only the organizer of
    the event can cancel it, providing a safety mechanism against unauthorized cancellations.
    This function is typically used when a guild leader or organizer wishes to abort
    a planned guild activity such as a raid, social gathering, or other coordinated
    events. If successful, the event will be removed from active tracking and any
    associated notifications or reminders will be cleared.
  parameters:
  - name: organizer
    description: Pointer to the organizer object (likely a Player or GuildMember)
      that must match the event's organizer for cancellation to succeed. Can be null
      to bypass organizer validation.
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild event to be canceled. Must correspond
      to an existing active event in the coordinator's tracking system.
  returns: Returns true if the guild event was successfully canceled and removed from
    the coordinator, false otherwise. Failure may occur if the event does not exist,
    the organizer is invalid, or the event has already been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Event Cancellation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 eventId = 12345;\n\
      if (guildEventCoordinator->CancelGuildEvent(&player, eventId)) {\n    // Event\
      \ successfully canceled\n    sWorld->SendGlobalText(\"Guild event has been canceled.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to cancel event\n    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      Failed to cancel guild event.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Cancellation with Null Organizer Check
    code: "uint32 eventId = 12345;\n// Cancel event without organizer verification\n\
      if (guildEventCoordinator->CancelGuildEvent(nullptr, eventId)) {\n    // Event\
      \ canceled regardless of organizer\n    sWorld->SendGlobalText(\"Guild event\
      \ has been forcefully canceled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GuildEventCoordinator maintains a registry of
    active guild events and their associated organizers. It is designed to prevent
    unauthorized cancellation attempts by verifying the organizer's identity before
    proceeding with the operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the eventId parameter corresponds to an actual active event,
    otherwise the method will return false without performing any action. Also, be
    cautious when passing a null organizer pointer as it may allow for unintended
    cancellations if not handled carefully in the underlying implementation.
