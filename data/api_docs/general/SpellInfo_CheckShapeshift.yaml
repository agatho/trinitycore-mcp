documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell can be cast while in a specific shapeshift form.
  description: This method evaluates whether a spell is compatible with the current
    shapeshift form of the caster. It determines if the spell can be cast when the
    player is in a particular form, such as cat, bear, or other shapeshift states.
    The method returns a SpellCastResult that indicates whether the spell can proceed
    or if there are restrictions based on the current form. This functionality is
    crucial for managing spell restrictions during different shapeshift states in
    World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SpellCastResult indicating whether the spell can be cast while
    in the specified shapeshift form. Possible return values include SPELL_CAST_OK,
    SPELL_FAILED_SHAPESHIFT, or other relevant error codes depending on the compatibility
    with the current form.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "SpellCastResult result = spellInfo->CheckShapeshift(1);\nif (result ==\
      \ SPELL_CAST_OK)\n{\n    // Spell can be cast in this form\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell casting checks to ensure that
    the spell is compatible with the current shapeshift state. It may involve checking
    against various forms like cat, bear, or other shapeshift types.
  warnings: This method does not directly check if the player is in a specific form,
    but rather evaluates whether the spell can be cast while in that form. The result
    may vary depending on the spell's requirements and the current form.
