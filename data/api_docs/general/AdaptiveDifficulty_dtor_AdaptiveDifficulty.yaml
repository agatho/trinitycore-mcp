  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: ~AdaptiveDifficulty
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::~AdaptiveDifficulty()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AdaptiveDifficulty instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~AdaptiveDifficulty destructor is called automatically when an
    AdaptiveDifficulty object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method
    ensures proper cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory or internal data structures
    used by the adaptive difficulty system. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this class likely manages difficulty scaling for encounters
    based on player count and other factors. The destructor performs necessary cleanup
    operations to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AdaptiveDifficulty object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    AdaptiveDifficulty diff;\n    // ... use diff\
      \ ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of AdaptiveDifficulty pointer
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty* diff = new AdaptiveDifficulty();

      // ... use diff ...

      delete diff; // Calls destructor explicitly'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope or are deleted. Developers should not manually call destructors unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. AdaptiveDifficulty likely manages
    internal game state related to dynamic difficulty adjustment, so proper destruction
    ensures no dangling references remain.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke destructors unless implementing custom memory management.
    The destructor assumes all internal resources have been properly initialized and
    managed by the class. Avoid calling destructor on objects that may already be
    destroyed or partially constructed.
