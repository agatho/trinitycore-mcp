  class: BotResourcePool
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotResourcePool::Initialize(uint32 initialPoolSize)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot resource pool with a specified initial size.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal structure of the BotResourcePool
    by allocating memory for a given number of resources. This method must be called
    before any other operations on the pool can be performed. It ensures that the
    pool has sufficient capacity to manage the expected number of bot resources, preventing
    potential allocation failures during runtime. The initialization process typically
    involves setting up internal data structures such as arrays or containers to hold
    resource references and managing their lifecycle within the context of the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: initialPoolSize
    description: Specifies the initial number of resources that the pool should be
      able to manage. This value determines the capacity of the internal storage structure
      and affects memory allocation. Valid values are positive integers representing
      the desired pool size.
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and the pool is ready
    for use; returns false if the initialization failed due to invalid parameters
    or insufficient system resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "BotResourcePool pool;\nbool success = pool.Initialize(100);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Pool is ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Error Handling
    code: "BotResourcePool pool;\nuint32 poolSize = 500;\nif (!pool.Initialize(poolSize))\
      \ {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed\
      \ to initialize bot resource pool with size %u\", poolSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a BotResourcePool
    instance. Subsequent calls to Initialize may result in undefined behavior or resource
    leaks. The initial pool size directly impacts memory consumption and performance,
    so it's recommended to estimate the required capacity based on expected bot usage
    patterns.
  warnings: Calling Initialize with an excessively large value can lead to memory
    allocation failures or performance degradation. Ensure that the initialPoolSize
    parameter is reasonable for your system's capabilities and the expected number
    of bots in operation.
