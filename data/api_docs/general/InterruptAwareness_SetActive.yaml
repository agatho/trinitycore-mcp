  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: SetActive
  signature: void InterruptAwareness::SetActive(bool active)
documentation:
  brief: Activates or deactivates the interrupt awareness state for an object.
  description: The SetActive method controls whether an InterruptAwareness object
    is currently active or inactive. When activated, the object may respond to interruptible
    events or conditions based on its internal logic. This method typically toggles
    internal flags or states that determine how the object interacts with game systems
    such as spell interruption, movement cancellation, or other event-based behaviors.
    The activation state can affect how the object behaves during gameplay scenarios
    where awareness of interrupts is required.
  parameters:
  - name: active
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to activate (true) or deactivate
      (false) the interrupt awareness state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      awareness.SetActive(true); // Activate interrupt awareness

      awareness.SetActive(false); // Deactivate interrupt awareness'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Activation
    code: "if (player->HasAura(SPELL_INTERRUPTIBLE_AURA)) {\n    awareness.SetActive(true);\n\
      } else {\n    awareness.SetActive(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags or state variables within the
    InterruptAwareness class. It should be called from a thread-safe context if used
    in multiplayer environments, as interrupt handling often involves synchronization
    with game events.
  warnings: Ensure that the object's activation state is properly managed to avoid
    unexpected behavior during gameplay. Improper use of this method may cause the
    object to miss or incorrectly respond to interrupt events.
