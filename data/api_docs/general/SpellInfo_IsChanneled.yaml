  method: IsChanneled
  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsChanneled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is a channeled spell.
  description: This method checks if the spell is classified as a channeled spell,
    which means it requires continuous casting over time rather than being instant.
    Channeled spells typically involve maintaining focus on a target or area for a
    specified duration. The method returns true when the spell has the channeled flag
    set in its database entry, indicating that it can be cast and maintained as a
    channel. This is important for determining spell behavior during combat and for
    managing spell cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is channeled, false otherwise. The method checks
    the spell's database flags to determine if it has the channeled property set.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a spell is channeled
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsChanneled()) {\n    // Spell is channeled\n    // Handle\
      \ channeling logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Spell is not channeled\n    // Handle\
      \ instant cast logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the spell's database flags and should be used in conjunction
    with other spell-related methods to properly determine spell behavior. It's important
    to note that some spells may have both channeled and non-channeled properties
    depending on their specific implementation.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole indicator of spell behavior during
    combat, as it only checks the database flags. Actual spell behavior may depend
    on additional factors such as casting time, duration, and target requirements.
