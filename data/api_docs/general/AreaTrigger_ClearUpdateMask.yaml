  class: AreaTrigger
  method: ClearUpdateMask
  signature: void AreaTrigger::ClearUpdateMask(bool remove)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the update mask of the area trigger, optionally removing it from updates.
  description: The ClearUpdateMask method resets the internal update mask of an AreaTrigger
    object, which is used to track which fields have been modified and need to be
    sent to clients. When the 'remove' parameter is set to true, the area trigger
    is also removed from the active update list, preventing further updates until
    it's re-added. This method is typically called during cleanup or when transitioning
    the area trigger's state. The behavior ensures efficient network usage by avoiding
    unnecessary field updates and maintaining synchronization with client-side representations.
  parameters:
  - name: remove
    description: If true, removes the area trigger from active update lists; if false,
      only clears the update mask without removing it from updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to clear update mask
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->ClearUpdateMask(false); // Only clear the mask

      // No further updates will be sent for this trigger until fields are marked
      as dirty'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage to fully remove area trigger from updates
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      trigger->ClearUpdateMask(true); // Clear mask and remove from active updates

      // Trigger will no longer be sent to clients until reactivated'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the update system for dynamic objects in TrinityCore.
    It's important to understand that clearing the update mask without removing the
    object may lead to stale data being sent if fields are not properly marked as
    dirty before next update cycle.
  warnings: Calling ClearUpdateMask(true) will prevent any further updates from being
    sent to clients for this area trigger until it is explicitly re-added to the update
    system. Ensure that cleanup or removal logic accounts for this behavior to avoid
    unexpected client-side issues.
