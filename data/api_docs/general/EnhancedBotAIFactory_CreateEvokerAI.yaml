  class: EnhancedBotAIFactory
  method: CreateEvokerAI
  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateEvokerAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes an Evoker AI for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreateEvokerAI method is responsible for instantiating and configuring
    an Evoker-specific AI behavior for a given bot player. This function likely sets
    up the AI's spell selection, targeting logic, and combat strategies tailored to
    the Evoker class. It may also initialize internal state variables, register necessary
    event handlers, or configure the AI's decision-making process. The method returns
    an integer status code indicating success or failure of the AI creation process.
    This functionality is part of the EnhancedBotAI system which extends TrinityCore's
    default bot AI capabilities with enhanced class-specific behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns 0 on successful AI creation, or a non-zero error code if the operation
    fails. Possible error codes may indicate issues such as invalid player reference,
    unsupported class type, or insufficient memory for AI initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Evoker AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get a valid bot player\nint result = factory->CreateEvokerAI(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully created\n    printf(\"Evoker AI created\
      \ successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ create Evoker AI, error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot AI framework that requires proper
    initialization of the bot player before calling. The returned integer status code
    should be checked to ensure successful AI creation. Implementation may involve
    memory allocation for AI state data structures and potential registration with
    game systems.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-Evoker class bot player may result in undefined
    behavior or failure. Ensure that the Player object is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method. The method may throw exceptions or return error codes
    if insufficient resources are available.
