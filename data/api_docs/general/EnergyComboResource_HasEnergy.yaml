documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has sufficient energy to perform an action
  description: The HasEnergy method determines whether the current EnergyComboResource
    object contains enough energy units to satisfy a specified requirement. This method
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft's combat system to validate actions that
    consume energy, such as abilities or spells that require a certain amount of energy
    to execute. The check is performed against the internal energy counter of the
    resource object, ensuring that the requested amount is available before allowing
    the action to proceed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the resource contains at least the specified amount of
    energy; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Energy Check
    code: "if (player->GetEnergyComboResource()->HasEnergy(25)) {\n    // Player has\
      \ enough energy to cast a spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ENERGY_CONSUMING_ABILITY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Energy Validation in Combat
    code: "Unit* target = GetVictim();\nif (target && player->GetEnergyComboResource()->HasEnergy(50))\
      \ {\n    // Ensure player has enough energy before using a high-cost ability\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_HIGH_ENERGY_ABILITY);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle insufficient energy case\n    player->SendEquipError(EQUIP_ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_MONEY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the energy resource; it only performs a read-only
    check. The energy amount is typically managed by the game engine and updated through
    various combat events.
