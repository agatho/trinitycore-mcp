  class: LootRoll
  method: GetItemDisenchantSkillRequired
  signature: int LootRoll::GetItemDisenchantSkillRequired() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the required disenchant skill level for the item associated with
    this loot roll.
  description: This method returns the minimum required disenchanting skill level
    needed to disenchant the item that is currently being rolled on. The returned
    value corresponds to the skill requirement defined in the game's database for
    the specific item type. This is used primarily in the context of loot rolling
    mechanics where players must meet certain skill thresholds to participate in or
    benefit from disenchanting an item. The method does not perform any validation
    or checks beyond returning the stored value, and it assumes that the LootRoll
    object has been properly initialized with a valid item.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the minimum required disenchant skill level for
    the item. A value of 0 typically indicates no skill requirement, while higher
    values indicate increasing skill thresholds needed to disenchant the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LootRoll* roll = ...; // Assume this is a valid LootRoll object\nint requiredSkill\
      \ = roll->GetItemDisenchantSkillRequired();\nif (requiredSkill > 0)\n{\n   \
      \ printf(\"This item requires %d disenchant skill to disenchant.\\n\", requiredSkill);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Skill Requirement Before Disenchanting
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume this is a valid Player object\nLootRoll*\
      \ roll = ...; // Assume this is a valid LootRoll object\nint requiredSkill =\
      \ roll->GetItemDisenchantSkillRequired();\nif (requiredSkill > 0 && player->GetSkillValue(SKILL_ENCHANTING)\
      \ < requiredSkill)\n{\n    player->SendNotification(\"You do not have sufficient\
      \ disenchanting skill to disenchant this item.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with disenchanting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data that is typically set when the LootRoll
    object is created and associated with a specific item. It does not perform any
    dynamic calculations or lookups at runtime, so it's efficient to call multiple
    times without performance impact.
  warnings: Be aware that this value may be zero for items that do not require a skill
    level to disenchant, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly checked
    in conditional logic. Also, the returned value is only meaningful when the LootRoll
    object actually represents a valid item with a defined disenchant requirement.
