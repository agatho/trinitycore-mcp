documentation:
  brief: Loads a map tile into the static map tree for collision detection and navigation.
  description: The LoadMapTile method initializes and loads a specific map tile into
    the StaticMapTree data structure, enabling collision detection and pathfinding
    for that tile region. This method is typically invoked during map loading or when
    a player enters a new tile area. It integrates with the VMapManager2 system to
    handle virtual map data and ensures that the tile's geometry is properly registered
    for use in the game world's navigation system. The method returns a LoadResult
    indicating success or failure of the operation, which helps in managing tile loading
    states and error handling within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: tileX
    description: The X coordinate of the tile to load, representing the horizontal
      position in the map grid system
  - name: tileY
    description: The Y coordinate of the tile to load, representing the vertical position
      in the map grid system
  - name: vm
    description: Pointer to the VMapManager2 instance responsible for managing virtual
      maps and their data
  returns: LoadResult enum indicating whether the tile was successfully loaded (LOAD_RESULT_SUCCESS),
    failed to load due to missing data (LOAD_RESULT_ERROR), or if loading is already
    in progress (LOAD_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS).

  - title: Basic Tile Loading Example
    code: "StaticMapTree* mapTree = sVMapManager->GetMapTree(0);\nLoadResult result\
      \ = mapTree->LoadMapTile(10, 15, sVMapManager);\nif (result == LOAD_RESULT_SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Tile loaded successfully\n    printf(\"Tile (10,15) loaded\\n\"\
      );\n} else if (result == LOAD_RESULT_ERROR) {\n    // Handle loading error\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to load tile (10,15)\\n\");\n}"

  - title: Tile Loading with Error Handling
    code: "void LoadPlayerAreaTiles(uint32 mapId, uint32 playerX, uint32 playerY)\
      \ {\n    StaticMapTree* mapTree = sVMapManager->GetMapTree(mapId);\n    if (!mapTree)\
      \ return;\n    \n    // Load surrounding tiles\n    for (int dx = -1; dx <=\
      \ 1; ++dx) {\n        for (int dy = -1; dy <= 1; ++dy) {\n            uint32\
      \ tileX = (playerX >> 7) + dx;\n            uint32 tileY = (playerY >> 7) +\
      \ dy;\n            \n            LoadResult result = mapTree->LoadMapTile(tileX,\
      \ tileY, sVMapManager);\n            if (result == LOAD_RESULT_ERROR) {\n  \
      \              // Log error but continue loading other tiles\n             \
      \   sLog->outError(\"Failed to load tile %u,%u\", tileX, tileY);\n         \
      \   }\n        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the virtual map system in TrinityCore and is crucial
    for proper collision detection and pathfinding. The method may block if the tile
    data needs to be loaded from disk, so it's recommended to call this during map
    initialization or when loading new areas rather than in performance-critical code
    paths. The tile coordinates are typically derived from world coordinates using
    the map's tile size constants.
  warnings: Calling LoadMapTile with invalid tile coordinates may result in undefined
    behavior or errors. Ensure that the VMapManager2 pointer is valid and properly
    initialized before calling this method. Repeatedly calling this method on already-loaded
    tiles will return LOAD_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS, so implement proper state checking
    to avoid unnecessary operations.
