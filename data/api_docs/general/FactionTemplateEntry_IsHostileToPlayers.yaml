  signature: bool FactionTemplateEntry::IsHostileToPlayers() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the faction template is hostile toward player characters.
  description: The IsHostileToPlayers method checks if the faction template associated
    with this entry defines hostility toward player characters. This is a core game
    mechanic used to determine combat behavior, interaction rules, and NPC reaction
    types in World of Warcraft. The method evaluates internal flags or properties
    within the FactionTemplateEntry structure that indicate whether players should
    be considered enemies by entities using this faction template. It does not consider
    dynamic faction changes or temporary states such as PvP flags or reputation modifiers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the faction template is configured to be hostile toward
    player characters; otherwise returns false. This indicates that NPCs or game objects
    using this faction will initiate combat with players unless specific conditions
    override this behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Faction Template is Hostile to Players
    code: "FactionTemplateEntry* entry = sFactionTemplateStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (entry && entry->IsHostileToPlayers()) {\n    // Handle hostile faction logic\n\
      \    printf(\"This faction template is hostile to players.\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle non-hostile faction logic\n    printf(\"This faction template\
      \ is not hostile to players.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The result of this method is based on static faction template data and does
    not account for dynamic player or faction state changes such as PvP status, reputation
    levels, or temporary faction modifiers. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    logic for NPCs to determine initial hostility.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for determining combat readiness; other
    factors like reputation, PvP flags, and current game state should also be considered
    for accurate player-NPC interactions.
