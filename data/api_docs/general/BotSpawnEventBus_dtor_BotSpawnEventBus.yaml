  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::~BotSpawnEventBus()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotSpawnEventBus instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotSpawnEventBus class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any event listeners, unsubscribing from bot spawn events, and ensuring
    no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. The destructor is automatically invoked
    when a BotSpawnEventBus object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It
    ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures related to handling bot spawning
    events within the TrinityCore framework.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotSpawnEventBus
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    BotSpawnEventBus eventBus;\n    // Use eventBus...\n\
      \    // Destructor called automatically when eventBus goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotSpawnEventBus
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus* eventBus = new BotSpawnEventBus();

      // Use eventBus...

      delete eventBus; // Triggers destructor

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects are destroyed. Ensure
    that no other threads are actively using the event bus during destruction to avoid
    race conditions.
  warnings: Avoid calling this destructor manually unless you have a specific reason
    and understand the implications. The destructor assumes all internal resources
    are valid and should not be used on partially constructed or already destroyed
    objects.
