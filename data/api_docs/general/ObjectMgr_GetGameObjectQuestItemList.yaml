documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of quest item IDs associated with a game object
  description: The GetGameObjectQuestItemList method returns a constant pointer to
    an array of integers representing the quest item IDs that are related to a specific
    game object identified by its entry ID. This functionality is used in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore emulation to manage quest item interactions with game objects
    such as quest givers, chests, or other interactive elements. The returned array
    is typically used during quest completion checks and item requirement validations.
    The method accesses internal data structures that map game object entries to their
    associated quest items, ensuring proper quest progression mechanics are maintained.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing quest item IDs
    associated with the game object. Returns NULL if no quest items are associated
    with the specified game object or if the game object ID does not exist in the
    database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 gameObjectId = 17654; // Example game object ID\nconst int* questItems\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectQuestItemList(gameObjectId);\nif (questItems !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) // Assuming max 4 quest items\
      \ per GO\n    {\n        if (questItems[i] == 0) break;\n        printf(\"Quest\
      \ Item ID: %d\\n\", questItems[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal database caches and should be used with caution
    in performance-critical sections. The returned array is managed internally and
    must not be modified or freed by the caller. The method assumes that game object
    entries are properly loaded into memory before being called.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be NULL if no quest items exist for the specified
    game object ID, so always check for null before using the result. Do not assume
    a fixed size of the returned array; use appropriate bounds checking when iterating
    through the values.
