  class: GuildAchievementMgr
  method: SendAllTrackedCriterias
  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::SendAllTrackedCriterias(Player * receiver,
    const int & trackedCriterias) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends all tracked criteria data to a specified player for guild achievements.
  description: The SendAllTrackedCriterias method is responsible for transmitting
    the current state of all tracked achievement criteria to a specific player within
    the context of a guild. This functionality is typically used when a player joins
    a guild or when the guild's achievement tracking data needs to be synchronized
    with the client. The method utilizes the provided Player object to send the relevant
    data packet, ensuring that the player's UI reflects the correct progress towards
    guild achievements. It operates as part of the GuildAchievementMgr class which
    manages all guild-related achievement tracking and communication.
  parameters:
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the tracked criteria
      data. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid connected
      player in the game world.
  - name: trackedCriterias
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the tracked criteria identifier
      or index. This value determines which specific set of criteria data is sent
      to the receiver.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildAchievementMgr guildMgr;

      Player* player = ...; // Valid player pointer

      int trackedCriteriaId = 12345;

      guildMgr.SendAllTrackedCriterias(player, trackedCriteriaId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Multiple Criteria Sets
    code: "GuildAchievementMgr guildMgr;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Valid player pointer\n\
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    int trackedCriteriaId = i * 1000;\n   \
      \ guildMgr.SendAllTrackedCriterias(player, trackedCriteriaId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player login or guild join events
    to ensure the client has up-to-date achievement tracking information. The method
    assumes that the Player object is properly initialized and connected to the game
    server. It may trigger network communication which could impact performance if
    called excessively in rapid succession.
  warnings: Ensure that the receiver parameter points to a valid, connected player
    object; otherwise, attempting to send data may cause undefined behavior or crashes.
    The trackedCriterias value should be within expected range for the achievement
    system to avoid sending invalid data.
