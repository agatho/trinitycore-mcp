  signature: bool SpellInfo::HasInitialAggro() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell has initial aggro generated upon cast.
  description: This method checks if a spell generates initial threat (aggression)
    when cast on targets, which is crucial for understanding how spells affect combat
    behavior in World of Warcraft. It returns true if the spell creates initial aggro,
    false otherwise. The method is used primarily for determining spell behavior during
    combat and is essential for proper spell handling in the game mechanics. This
    functionality affects how players and NPCs react to spell casts, particularly
    in terms of threat generation and combat initiation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell generates initial aggro upon casting, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the spell will create immediate threat when cast on targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->HasInitialAggro()) {\n    // Spell generates initial aggro\n\
      \    // Handle accordingly\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine combat behavior. The implementation may vary depending on the specific
    spell and its mechanics, but generally it's related to how spells interact with
    target's threat system.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining spell effectiveness or
    damage output, as it only relates to initial aggro generation. Misunderstanding
    this method can lead to incorrect combat behavior in spell handling.
