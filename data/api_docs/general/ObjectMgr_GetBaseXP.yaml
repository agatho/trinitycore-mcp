documentation:
  brief: Returns the base experience points required to advance a player from the
    specified level to the next level.
  description: The GetBaseXP method retrieves the base amount of experience points
    needed for a player to level up from a given level. This value is typically used
    in the game's experience calculation system to determine how much XP is required
    for character progression. The method likely accesses internal data structures
    or configuration tables that define XP requirements per level, which may be configurable
    or hardcoded depending on the TrinityCore build and server settings. It serves
    as a fundamental component in the player advancement mechanics of World of Warcraft-based
    servers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the base experience points required
    to advance from the specified level to the next level. The exact value depends
    on the current level passed to the method and is typically higher for higher levels,
    following standard XP progression curves used in MMORPGs.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Base XP for Level 10
    code: 'uint32 xpForLevel10 = sObjectMgr->GetBaseXP(10);

      // Returns the base XP required to level from 10 to 11'
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate Total XP for Level Progression
    code: "uint32 totalXP = 0;\nfor (uint8 i = 1; i <= 60; ++i)\n{\n    totalXP +=\
      \ sObjectMgr->GetBaseXP(i);\n}\n// Calculates cumulative XP needed to reach\
      \ level 60 from level 1"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely cached or precomputed for performance reasons, as it
    may be called frequently during player leveling calculations. The actual XP values
    returned are determined by the server's configuration and may vary between different
    World of Warcraft expansions or custom configurations.
