documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell area bounds for a given quest end map.
  description: This method retrieves the SpellAreaForQuestMapBounds structure associated
    with a specific quest ID. It is used internally by the TrinityCore server to manage
    quest-related spell areas and their mapping to specific maps. The returned bounds
    define the geographical limits within which a quest's ending conditions can be
    met. This functionality is crucial for proper quest completion handling, especially
    when quests are tied to specific locations or zones. The method performs a lookup
    in the internal spell area database using the provided quest ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellAreaForQuestMapBounds object containing the bounds information for
    the specified quest's end map. This typically includes minimum and maximum coordinates
    that define the area where the quest can be completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve quest end map bounds
    code: "SpellAreaForQuestMapBounds bounds = sSpellMgr->GetSpellAreaForQuestEndMapBounds(12345);\n\
      if (bounds.first != bounds.second)\n{\n    // Process the bounds\n    printf(\"\
      Quest 12345 has map bounds from %f to %f\\n\", bounds.first, bounds.second);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell area management system. It's typically
    called during quest completion checks and requires that the spell area data for
    the quest has been properly loaded into memory. The returned bounds are used to
    validate whether a player's position meets the geographical requirements for completing
    a quest.
  warnings: The method assumes that the quest ID exists in the database and that corresponding
    spell area data is loaded. If an invalid quest ID is passed, the behavior may
    result in empty or invalid bounds. Always verify that the quest exists before
    calling this method.
