  brief: Manages the application and removal of debuffs on targets within the Evoker's
    range.
  description: The ManageDebuffs method is responsible for handling the logic related
    to applying, refreshing, and removing debuffs from enemy targets. It evaluates
    the current state of debuffs on targets and determines whether new debuffs should
    be applied or existing ones should be refreshed based on the Evoker's abilities
    and combat strategy. This method typically integrates with the AI's decision-making
    process to ensure optimal use of debuff mechanics during encounters. The method
    operates within the context of the Evoker class, which is part of the TrinityCore
    framework for World of Warcraft emulation.

    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    ManageDebuffs();\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the Evoker's main AI update loop.
    It may involve checking for debuff expiration, evaluating target vulnerability,
    and selecting appropriate debuff spells based on the current encounter state.
