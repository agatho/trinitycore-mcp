documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AuraEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the AuraEventBus
    class, providing global access to a single shared instance of the event bus. This
    is commonly used in TrinityCore's aura system to manage and dispatch events related
    to auras, such as application, removal, or modification of aura effects. The method
    ensures that only one instance of AuraEventBus exists throughout the application
    lifecycle, making it thread-safe for use in multi-threaded environments like World
    of Warcraft servers. This pattern is essential for maintaining consistent event
    handling across different parts of the aura subsystem without requiring explicit
    instantiation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of AuraEventBus. The method never returns
    NULL as it's implemented using a static local variable or similar thread-safe
    singleton mechanism.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuraEventBus* eventBus = AuraEventBus::instance();

      // Use the event bus to register handlers or dispatch events

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering an Event Handler
    code: "AuraEventBus* bus = AuraEventBus::instance();\nbus->RegisterHandler(AuraEventType::AURA_APPLIED,\
      \ [](Aura const* aura) {\n    // Handle aura application\n});\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The singleton implementation typically uses a static local variable or similar
    thread-safe mechanism to ensure that the instance is created only once. This method
    should be called sparingly as it's part of the core event handling infrastructure
    and may have performance implications if overused in tight loops.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, modifying or relying on global state can make
    unit testing difficult. Additionally, improper use of the returned pointer could
    lead to memory management issues if not handled carefully in multi-threaded contexts.
