documentation:
  brief: Updates the Demon Hunter's Decay Pain ability state based on elapsed time.
  description: The DecayPain method manages the internal timer and state logic for
    the Demon Hunter's Decay Pain ability. This method is typically called during
    the AI update cycle to handle the ability's cooldown, duration, and any associated
    effects. It processes the time difference (diff) parameter to determine if the
    ability should be activated, refreshed, or deactivated. The method ensures proper
    timing of the ability's effects and maintains synchronization with the game's
    combat mechanics.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic AI Update Integration
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    DecayPain(diff);\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly during the AI update loop.
    The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds elapsed since last call and should
    be passed directly from the UpdateAI method. Implementation assumes proper initialization
    of ability state variables before first invocation.
