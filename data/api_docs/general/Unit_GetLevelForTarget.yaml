documentation:
  brief: Returns the level of a target unit based on the current player's level.
  description: This method retrieves the level of a target unit, typically used in
    combat scenarios or when determining the appropriate level for targeting. It is
    commonly employed in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to ensure proper
    targeting mechanics and level-based interactions. The method considers the player's
    current level and adjusts the target level accordingly, making it essential for
    maintaining game balance during combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The parameter represents a pointer to an integer value that typically
      corresponds to the target's level or a related value used in determining the
      appropriate level for targeting.
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the level of the target unit, which
    is typically adjusted based on the player's current level and other game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      uint8 level = target->GetLevelForTarget(&player->GetLevel());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in combat scenarios and requires proper handling
    of the target's level to ensure accurate gameplay mechanics. It may involve internal
    calculations based on player's level and other factors.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect targeting behavior,
    especially when dealing with different level ranges or when using it outside of
    combat context.
