documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new CommandResponse object with default values.
  description: The CommandResponse constructor initializes a new instance of the CommandResponse
    class. This constructor sets up the internal state of the command response object,
    preparing it for use in handling game commands. The initialization typically includes
    setting default values for response status, message content, and any associated
    data structures. In the context of TrinityCore's architecture, this constructor
    is often called when creating command response objects to be populated with command
    execution results before being sent back to clients or logged.

  - title: Basic CommandResponse Initialization
    code: 'CommandResponse response;

      // response is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called implicitly when declaring a CommandResponse
    variable. Developers should be aware that the object's state will depend on the
    implementation of the default constructor, which may initialize certain fields
    to specific default values such as empty strings or zero values.
