  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: ShareQuest
  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::ShareQuest(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Shares a quest with group members within the GroupCoordinator's scope.
  description: The ShareQuest method attempts to distribute a specified quest to all
    eligible players within the group managed by the GroupCoordinator. This functionality
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to
    ensure that group members receive quest updates and objectives when a quest is
    initiated or shared by one member. The method evaluates whether the quest can
    be shared based on group membership, quest requirements, and player state. It
    returns true if the quest sharing process was successful for all eligible participants,
    and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest was successfully shared with all group members;
    returns false if the sharing failed for any reason, such as invalid quest ID,
    missing group members, or quest restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Sharing
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = player->GetGroupCoordinator();\nif (coordinator)\n\
      {\n    bool success = coordinator->ShareQuest(12345);\n    if (success)\n  \
      \      TC_LOG_INFO(\"player\", \"Quest 12345 shared successfully with group.\"\
      );\n    else\n        TC_LOG_ERROR(\"player\", \"Failed to share quest 12345\
      \ with group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the GroupCoordinator and assumes
    that the associated player is part of a valid group. Performance may be affected
    if the group contains many members or if quest sharing involves complex conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest ID passed to this method is valid and exists in
    the database; otherwise, the method will likely return false without any error
    messages. Also, calling this method outside of a group context might lead to undefined
    behavior.
