  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: CanSpawnMore
  signature: bool BotSpawnerAdapter::CanSpawnMore() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether additional bot units can be spawned by the spawner adapter.
  description: The CanSpawnMore method evaluates the current state of the bot spawner
    to determine if it is permissible to spawn more bot units. This check typically
    considers factors such as maximum spawn limits, available resources, or game world
    constraints. The method returns true if spawning is allowed and false otherwise.
    It is commonly used in bot management systems to prevent exceeding configured
    limits or to ensure proper resource allocation during bot creation processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether more bots can be spawned. Returns true
    if spawning is permitted, false if it is not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (spawner->CanSpawnMore()) {\n    // Proceed with spawning a new bot\n\
      \    spawner->SpawnBot();\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no more bots can\
      \ be spawned\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"Cannot spawn more bots at this time.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before attempting to spawn a new bot to avoid
    exceeding configured limits or causing resource exhaustion. The implementation
    may involve checking internal counters, world state conditions, or configuration
    settings.
