documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has enough runes of specified types to cast a spell
    or ability
  description: The HasRunes method determines whether a player possesses sufficient
    rune resources to activate a specific ability or spell that requires blood, frost,
    and unholy runes. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's Death Knight
    class mechanics where abilities consume specific types of runes. The method evaluates
    the current rune counts against the required amounts for each rune type and returns
    true only if all specified rune requirements are met. It does not modify any rune
    state but simply performs a validation check.
  parameters:
  - name: blood
    description: The number of blood runes required for the ability or spell
  - name: frost
    description: The number of frost runes required for the ability or spell
  - name: unholy
    description: The number of unholy runes required for the ability or spell
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least the specified number of blood,
    frost, and unholy runes; otherwise returns false
  examples:
  - title: Basic rune check for a Death Knight ability
    code: "if (player->GetRuneResource()->HasRunes(1, 1, 0)) {\n    // Player has\
      \ at least 1 blood rune and 1 frost rune\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEATH_COIL,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for full rune set before casting a powerful ability
    code: "RuneResource* runes = player->GetRuneResource();\nif (runes->HasRunes(1,\
      \ 1, 1)) {\n    // Player has at least 1 of each rune type\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_DEATH_GRIP, true);\n} else {\n    // Not enough runes - handle accordingly\n\
      \    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough runes!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other rune management functions
    like GetRuneCount() or SpendRune(). The rune resource system in TrinityCore follows
    the standard World of Warcraft Death Knight rune mechanics where each rune type
    (blood, frost, unholy) has its own counter and cooldown mechanism. This method
    does not account for rune cooldowns directly but checks only the current available
    counts.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only validates the presence of runes, not their
    readiness or cooldown status. A player might have the required number of runes
    but they could all be on cooldown, making the ability unusable despite HasRunes
    returning true.
