  class: DruidAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float DruidAI::GetOptimalRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the Druid AI based on
    current target and spell capabilities.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the most effective distance at
    which a druid AI should engage its target for maximum damage output or spell efficacy.
    This calculation takes into account the druid's current form (e.g., cat, bear,
    caster), available spells, and the target's position. The method is typically
    used by the AI to decide whether to close distance, maintain range, or use abilities
    that have specific range requirements. It serves as a core component in pathfinding
    and spell casting decisions for druid NPCs within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the optimal engagement range in yards.
    A negative value may indicate an error condition or inability to determine a valid
    range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "float optimalRange = druidAI->GetOptimalRange();\nif (optimalRange > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with movement or spell casting based on this range\n    if\
      \ (druidAI->GetRangeToTarget() > optimalRange)\n        druidAI->MoveToTarget(optimalRange);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely considers the druid's current form and spell availability
    to determine range. It may also factor in environmental constraints or target
    mobility. The implementation might cache calculated values for performance reasons.
  warnings: The method assumes a valid target exists and that the AI has proper access
    to target information. Calling this method without a valid target could result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect range calculations.
