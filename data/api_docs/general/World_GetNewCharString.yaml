  brief: Returns the string used for new character creation in the world
  description: The GetNewCharString method retrieves the configuration-defined string
    that is used when creating new characters in the World of Warcraft server. This
    string typically represents a default or template value used during character
    creation, such as a base name or identifier prefix. The returned string is immutable
    and should not be modified directly. This method is commonly used by the core
    server logic to determine initial character properties or to validate character
    creation requests.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the new character creation
    string value as defined in the server configuration
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display the new character string
    code: 'World* world = World::instance();

      const std::string& newCharString = world->GetNewCharString();

      std::cout << "New character string: " << newCharString << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a configuration value that may be loaded from the worldserver.conf
    file or other server configuration sources. The returned string is cached and
    should remain consistent throughout the server's runtime unless explicitly reloaded
    via configuration reload mechanisms.
