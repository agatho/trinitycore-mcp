  class: PathOptimizer
  method: OptimizeGroupPaths
  signature: bool PathOptimizer::OptimizeGroupPaths(int & paths, bool maintainFormation)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes movement paths for a group of units to improve efficiency and maintain
    formation.
  description: The OptimizeGroupPaths method adjusts the movement trajectories of
    multiple units within a group to minimize overall travel time and distance while
    optionally maintaining a predefined formation. This optimization is particularly
    useful in scenarios involving large groups of NPCs or players moving together,
    such as during scripted events, boss encounters, or coordinated player activities.
    The method modifies internal path data structures and may affect unit positioning
    and movement behavior. It typically operates on units that are already assigned
    to a group or faction with shared movement objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: paths
    description: Reference to an integer that will be updated with the number of optimized
      paths. This value represents how many individual unit paths were modified during
      the optimization process.
  - name: maintainFormation
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to preserve the group's formation
      during path optimization. When true, units will attempt to maintain their relative
      positions; when false, paths are optimized purely for efficiency without regard
      to formation constraints.
  returns: Returns true if the path optimization was successful and at least one path
    was modified. Returns false if no paths were changed or if an error occurred during
    optimization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Optimization
    code: "int optimizedPaths = 0;\nbool success = optimizer->OptimizeGroupPaths(optimizedPaths,\
      \ true);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Process the optimized paths\n    printf(\"\
      Optimized %d paths while maintaining formation\\n\", optimizedPaths);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Efficiency-Driven Optimization
    code: "int optimizedPaths = 0;\nbool success = optimizer->OptimizeGroupPaths(optimizedPaths,\
      \ false);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Prioritize efficiency over formation\n  \
      \  printf(\"Optimized %d paths for maximum efficiency\\n\", optimizedPaths);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used by AI systems and movement planners within
    TrinityCore. It may have performance implications when dealing with large groups,
    as it involves recalculating paths for multiple units simultaneously. The optimization
    process considers unit speed, terrain, obstacles, and group dynamics to produce
    the most efficient movement patterns.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group that is currently in combat or under active
    movement control may result in unexpected behavior or path conflicts. Ensure that
    all units are in a stable state before invoking this optimization routine. Additionally,
    modifying paths during active gameplay can cause visual glitches if not handled
    carefully with respect to client-side synchronization.
