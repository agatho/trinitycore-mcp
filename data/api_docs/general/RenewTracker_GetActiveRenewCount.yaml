  class: RenewTracker
  method: GetActiveRenewCount
  signature: uint32 RenewTracker::GetActiveRenewCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of active Renew spells currently applied to the target.
  description: The GetActiveRenewCount method retrieves the number of active Renew
    spell effects that are currently affecting the tracked unit. In World of Warcraft's
    context, Renew is a healing spell that applies periodic healing over time. This
    method is typically used by the RenewTracker class to monitor and manage the state
    of Renew effects on a target. The returned count represents how many instances
    of the Renew spell are currently active, which can be important for various game
    mechanics such as spell stacking limits, damage calculations, or cooldown management.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of active Renew spells currently
    affecting the tracked unit. Returns 0 if no Renew spells are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Renew Count
    code: "uint32 renewCount = tracker.GetActiveRenewCount();\nif (renewCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Handle logic when Renew is active\n    sLog->outString(\"Active Renew\
      \ count: %u\", renewCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Renew Count for Spell Management
    code: "uint32 currentRenewCount = tracker.GetActiveRenewCount();\nif (currentRenewCount\
      \ < MAX_RENEW_STACKS)\n{\n    // Apply new Renew spell\n    caster->CastSpell(target,\
      \ RENEW_SPELL_ID, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle maximum stack limit reached\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Maximum Renew stacks reached: %u\", currentRenewCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other RenewTracker functionality
    to maintain accurate spell state tracking. The implementation likely relies on
    internal data structures that track active spell effects, and the returned value
    should be considered read-only. Performance impact is minimal as it only involves
    counting existing entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the RenewTracker instance has been properly initialized before
    calling this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method does
    not account for spell duration or time-based expiration; it simply reports currently
    tracked active effects.
