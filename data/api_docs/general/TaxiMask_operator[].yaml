  class: TaxiMask
  method: operator[]
  signature: const value_type & TaxiMask::operator[](size_t i) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the taxi mask value at the specified index.
  description: The operator[] method provides indexed access to elements within a
    TaxiMask object, which is typically used to represent a bitmask of available taxi
    paths in World of Warcraft. This method allows developers to query whether a specific
    taxi path is enabled or disabled for a player character. The TaxiMask class likely
    stores information about which flight paths a player has discovered or can use.
    Accessing elements via this operator is essential for managing player flight path
    data and ensuring correct behavior in the game's transportation system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const reference to the value_type at the specified index, representing
    whether a particular taxi path is active (true) or inactive (false).
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a Taxi Path is Available
    code: "TaxiMask mask;\n// Assume mask has been populated with taxi path data\n\
      if (mask[5] == true) {\n    // Taxi path at index 5 is available\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Taxi path 5 is unlocked\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through All Taxi Paths
    code: "TaxiMask mask;\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < mask.size(); ++i) {\n    if (mask[i])\
      \ {\n        // Process available taxi path at index i\n        std::cout <<\
      \ \"Available taxi path: \" << i << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs bounds checking in debug builds but does not perform
    any validation in release builds. It is recommended to ensure that the index passed
    to operator[] is within valid range to avoid undefined behavior. The TaxiMask
    class likely uses a bitset or similar structure internally for efficient storage
    and retrieval of taxi path states.
  warnings: Using an invalid index (outside the valid range) will result in undefined
    behavior. Always validate indices before calling this method, especially when
    dealing with dynamic data that may change during runtime. This method returns
    a const reference, so attempting to modify the returned value will cause compilation
    errors.
