  class: GroupEventBus
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void GroupEventBus::UpdateMetrics(std::chrono::microseconds processingTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics with the provided processing time for group event
    handling.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recording and updating
    performance-related statistics within the GroupEventBus class. It accepts a std::chrono::microseconds
    parameter representing the time taken to process a group event, which is then
    used to maintain aggregate metrics such as average processing time, total events
    processed, or other performance indicators. This method is typically called after
    completing the handling of a group-related event, allowing the system to track
    and report on the efficiency of group event processing. The method does not return
    any value but modifies internal state for monitoring purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: processingTime
    description: The time duration in microseconds that was spent processing a single
      group event. This value is used to update internal performance metrics and should
      represent the actual wall-clock time taken by the event handler.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... process group event ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      std::chrono::microseconds processingTime = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start);

      groupEventBus.UpdateMetrics(processingTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from within event handlers or processing loops
    to maintain real-time performance statistics. It's important that the processingTime
    value accurately reflects the actual time spent in the event handler, excluding
    any overhead from timing measurement itself.
