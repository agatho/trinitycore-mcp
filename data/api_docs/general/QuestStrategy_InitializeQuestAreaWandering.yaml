  class: QuestStrategy
  method: InitializeQuestAreaWandering
  signature: void QuestStrategy::InitializeQuestAreaWandering(BotAI * ai, const int
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes quest area wandering behavior for a bot AI with specified objective.
  description: The InitializeQuestAreaWandering method sets up the quest-related wandering
    behavior for a bot AI within a specific quest area. It configures the AI to navigate
    and interact with quest objectives based on the provided objective parameter.
    This method is typically called during the initialization phase of a bot's quest
    handling system to establish the appropriate patrol patterns and interaction logic
    for completing quest-related activities in a designated zone.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will be configured for quest area
      wandering behavior. Must not be null.
  - name: objective
    description: Integer value representing the specific quest objective or zone identifier
      that the bot should focus on during wandering. Valid values depend on the quest
      system's internal mapping.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Area Wandering Initialization
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();

      int questObjective = 12345;

      questStrategy.InitializeQuestAreaWandering(botAI, questObjective);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the BotAI instance has been properly
    initialized and configured for quest handling. The objective parameter must correspond
    to a valid quest or zone identifier within the TrinityCore database.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null ai pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the objective value corresponds to an existing quest or area before
    initialization.
