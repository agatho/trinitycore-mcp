  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: SetReactionTime
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::SetReactionTime(uint32 minMs, uint32 maxMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the minimum and maximum reaction times for mechanic awareness in milliseconds.
  description: The SetReactionTime method configures the timing parameters that control
    how quickly a creature or NPC will respond to mechanical triggers or events. This
    is typically used in AI behavior scripting to define the delay range between when
    an event occurs and when the entity reacts. The minimum and maximum values determine
    the lower and upper bounds of a random time interval within which the reaction
    will occur, adding variability to NPC behavior. This method affects the timing
    of awareness-based reactions such as aggro triggers, spell casting delays, or
    other mechanic-dependent responses in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: minMs
    description: The minimum reaction time in milliseconds. Must be a non-negative
      integer value.
  - name: maxMs
    description: The maximum reaction time in milliseconds. Must be a non-negative
      integer value, and should be greater than or equal to minMs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: mechanicAwareness->SetReactionTime(500, 1500);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Immediate Reaction
    code: mechanicAwareness->SetReactionTime(0, 0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal AI timing state. Changes take effect immediately
    for subsequent reactions. The reaction time is randomized between minMs and maxMs
    each time a reaction occurs. This functionality is primarily used in custom AI
    scripts or when overriding default NPC behavior patterns.
  warnings: Setting maxMs less than minMs will result in undefined behavior. Setting
    both values to zero may cause immediate reactions that could disrupt normal gameplay
    flow or create performance issues with rapid successive triggers.
