  class: GroupIntegration
  method: GetBotCount
  signature: uint32 GroupIntegration::GetBotCount(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of bot members in the specified group.
  description: The GetBotCount method retrieves the number of bot characters that
    are currently part of the given group. This functionality is typically used in
    TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft private servers or custom extensions where
    bot integration is enabled. The method iterates through all group members and
    counts those identified as bots, which may be implemented using specific flags
    or character properties. It's important to note that this count excludes regular
    player characters and only includes automated bot instances.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which the bot count is being retrieved.
      Must not be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of bot members in the specified
    group. Returns zero if no bots are present or if the group pointer is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check bot presence in a group
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    uint32 botCount\
      \ = GroupIntegration::GetBotCount(myGroup);\n    if (botCount > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        // Process bots in the group\n        sLog->outString(\"Group contains\
      \ %u bots.\", botCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using bot count to control group behavior
    code: "Group* party = player->GetGroup();\nif (party)\n{\n    uint32 botCount\
      \ = GroupIntegration::GetBotCount(party);\n    uint32 totalMembers = party->GetMembersCount();\n\
      \    \n    // Prevent actions if too many bots are present\n    if (botCount\
      \ > (totalMembers / 2))\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Warning: Group has\
      \ more bots than players.\");\n        return;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that bot identification is handled through a specific
    flag or property set on bot characters. The implementation may vary depending
    on how bots are registered within the TrinityCore system. Performance impact is
    minimal as it only involves iterating over group members once.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the group parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Always verify that the group exists before calling this method.
