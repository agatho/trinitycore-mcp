documentation:
  brief: Initiates the Soar spell cast for an Evoker AI unit.
  description: The CastSoar method is responsible for executing the Soar spell ability
    within the EvokerAI class. This method typically handles the logic required to
    cast the Soar spell, which is a key ability for Evokers in World of Warcraft.
    It may involve checking prerequisites such as mana availability, target validity,
    and cooldown status before proceeding with the actual spell casting. The implementation
    likely interfaces with the core TrinityCore spell system to ensure proper execution
    and synchronization with game mechanics.

    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n  \
      \  {\n        CastSoar();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger combat AI system and should be called
    within appropriate combat conditions. The actual spell casting behavior depends
    on the underlying TrinityCore spell system implementation.
