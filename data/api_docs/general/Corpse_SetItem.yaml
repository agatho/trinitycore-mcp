api:
  class: Corpse
  method: SetItem
  signature: void Corpse::SetItem(int slot, int item)
documentation:
  brief: Sets an item in a specified slot of the corpse.
  description: The SetItem method assigns an item to a specific inventory slot within
    a Corpse object. This method is typically used during the corpse creation process
    or when modifying the contents of a player's corpse after death. The slot parameter
    determines where the item will be placed, and the item parameter specifies which
    item to place there. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper loot
    distribution and corpse management in World of Warcraft's game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot index where the item should be placed. Valid values
      are typically between 0 and the maximum number of slots available on the corpse,
      which depends on the type of corpse (player or creature).
  - name: item
    description: The item ID to be placed in the specified slot. This represents the
      unique identifier for the item within the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set a weapon in the first slot of a player corpse
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized

      int weaponId = 12345;

      corpse->SetItem(0, weaponId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assign multiple items to different slots of a creature corpse
    code: 'Corpse* creatureCorpse = ...; // Assume creature corpse is initialized

      creatureCorpse->SetItem(0, 54321);

      creatureCorpse->SetItem(1, 98765);

      creatureCorpse->SetItem(2, 11223);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the Corpse object. It
    should only be called when the corpse is in a valid state for item assignment.
    The slot index must be within acceptable bounds to prevent memory corruption or
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid slot index may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the slot value corresponds to a valid inventory
    slot for the specific corpse type. Also, be cautious when modifying items on corpses
    that are already being processed by the game engine.
