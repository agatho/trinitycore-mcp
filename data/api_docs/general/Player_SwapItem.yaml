documentation:
  brief: Swaps items between two slots in the player's inventory
  description: The SwapItem method facilitates the movement of items between two inventory
    slots within a Player's inventory. This method is commonly used during gameplay
    mechanics such as item equipping, swapping equipment, or managing inventory space.
    It handles the internal logic of moving items from one slot to another, ensuring
    proper handling of item stacks and preventing conflicts with existing items in
    the destination slot. The method performs validation checks to ensure that the
    source and destination slots are valid and within the player's inventory bounds.
  parameters:
  - name: src
    description: The source slot from which the item will be moved. This is typically
      a valid inventory slot number, ranging from 0 to 36 (inclusive).
  - name: dst
    description: The destination slot where the item will be moved to. This is also
      a valid inventory slot number, ranging from 0 to 36 (inclusive).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Swap Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SwapItem(10, 15); // Swaps item from slot 10 to slot 15'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Inventory Management Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      // Swap items between two different inventory slots

      uint16 srcSlot = 12;

      uint16 dstSlot = 20;

      player->SwapItem(srcSlot, dstSlot);

      // This could be used for equipment swapping or inventory reorganizing'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally handles item stack merging when items are swapped into
    slots that already contain items. It is important to note that this method does
    not validate whether the slots are occupied or empty, but rather performs the
    swap operation directly. The implementation may involve checking for valid slot
    ranges and ensuring proper handling of item stacks.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can cause issues if invalid
    slot numbers are provided. It is recommended to verify that both source and destination
    slots are valid before calling this method, especially when dealing with equipment
    swapping or inventory management.
