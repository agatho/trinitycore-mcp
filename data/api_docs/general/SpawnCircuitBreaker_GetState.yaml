  method: GetState
  signature: CircuitState SpawnCircuitBreaker::GetState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current operational state of the circuit breaker.
  description: The GetState method returns the CircuitState enum value that represents
    the current operational status of the SpawnCircuitBreaker instance. This state
    indicates whether the circuit breaker is currently open, closed, or half-open,
    which determines how it handles incoming requests or events. The circuit breaker
    pattern is commonly used in distributed systems to prevent cascading failures
    when a service is unresponsive. In the context of TrinityCore, this method allows
    subsystems to query the health and operational readiness of spawn-related components
    that may be protected by circuit breaking logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A CircuitState enum value indicating the current state of the circuit
    breaker. Possible values typically include OPEN, CLOSED, and HALF_OPEN, each representing
    different failure handling behaviors: CLOSED allows normal operations, OPEN blocks
    all requests to prevent further strain, and HALF_OPEN permits a limited number
    of test requests to determine if the service has recovered.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Check
    code: "SpawnCircuitBreaker breaker;\nCircuitState state = breaker.GetState();\n\
      if (state == CircuitState::CLOSED) {\n    // Proceed with normal spawn operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Different Circuit States
    code: "SpawnCircuitBreaker* breaker = GetSpawnBreaker();\nswitch (breaker->GetState())\
      \ {\n    case CircuitState::OPEN:\n        // Log failure and skip spawn attempt\n\
      \        break;\n    case CircuitState::HALF_OPEN:\n        // Allow one test\
      \ spawn to verify service health\n        break;\n    case CircuitState::CLOSED:\n\
      \        // Proceed with normal spawn logic\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically thread-safe and should not block execution. The
    circuit breaker state may change asynchronously based on failure detection mechanisms,
    so callers should be prepared to handle state transitions between calls. The implementation
    likely uses atomic operations or mutexes to ensure consistency in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: Do not assume the circuit breaker state remains constant between multiple
    calls to GetState(). State changes can occur rapidly due to failure detection
    and recovery mechanisms. Always check the current state before making decisions
    about spawn behavior.
