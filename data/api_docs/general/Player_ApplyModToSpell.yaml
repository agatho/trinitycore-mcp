  notes: The method is typically called during spell processing or when applying modifiers
    from various sources. It's important to note that the SpellModifier structure
    must be properly initialized before calling this method. This method may affect
    spell calculation and should be used carefully in conjunction with other spell-related
    methods.
  warnings: Improper initialization of SpellModifier structures can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. The method should not be called during spell casting process
    without proper handling of spell modifiers. Care must be taken when applying multiple
    modifiers to same spell to avoid conflicts or incorrect modifications.
