  class: ActionFactory
  method: CreateClassActions
  signature: int ActionFactory::CreateClassActions(uint8 classId, uint8 spec)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes class-specific actions for a player based on their
    class ID and specialization.
  description: The CreateClassActions method is responsible for generating and setting
    up action buttons and abilities specific to a given player class and its chosen
    specialization. This method typically initializes the default action bar configurations,
    including spells, abilities, and talents that are unique to the specified class
    and spec combination. It ensures that players have access to their appropriate
    starting actions and abilities when they first select or change their class and
    specialization in the game. The method may also handle loading of class-specific
    action sets from configuration files or databases, ensuring proper initialization
    of player action capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: classId
    description: The unique identifier representing the player's class (e.g., WARRIOR
      = 1, PALADIN = 2, etc.). Valid values are defined in the TrinityCore class enumeration.
  - name: spec
    description: The specialization index for the given class. For classes with multiple
      specs, this determines which set of actions and abilities to initialize (e.g.,
      0 = First spec, 1 = Second spec, etc.).
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating success or failure of the action creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful completion, while
    negative values may represent errors such as invalid class ID or spec index.
  examples:
  - title: Initialize actions for a Warrior with Arms specialization
    code: "int result = actionFactory->CreateClassActions(WARRIOR, 0);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Actions successfully created\n    printf(\"Warrior actions\
      \ initialized\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ initialize Warrior actions\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize actions for a Mage with Fire specialization
    code: "uint8 classId = MAGE;\nuint8 specIndex = 2; // Fire specialization\nint\
      \ result = actionFactory->CreateClassActions(classId, specIndex);\nif (result\
      \ >= 0) {\n    printf(\"Mage Fire spec actions created successfully\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Error creating Mage Fire spec actions: %d\\n\", result);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player login or class change events.
    The implementation may involve database lookups or configuration file reads to
    determine the correct action sets for each class and specialization. It's important
    to note that this method does not directly modify the player object itself, but
    rather prepares the action data structure that will be used by the player's action
    manager.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid classId or spec values may result in
    undefined behavior or error codes. Ensure that all input parameters are validated
    before calling this method. Additionally, this method should not be called during
    active gameplay sessions without proper synchronization to avoid conflicts with
    existing actions.
