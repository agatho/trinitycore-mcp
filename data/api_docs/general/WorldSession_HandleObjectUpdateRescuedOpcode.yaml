    & objectUpdateRescued)
documentation:
  brief: Processes an object update rescued opcode from the client, handling rescued
    object state changes.
  description: The HandleObjectUpdateRescuedOpcode method is responsible for processing
    incoming object update rescued packets sent by the client. This method typically
    handles scenarios where objects that were previously in a rescued or controlled
    state are now being updated with new information. It processes the packet data
    to synchronize the server's understanding of the object's current state, including
    any changes to its position, health, or other relevant attributes. The method
    is part of the WorldSession's packet handling system and ensures proper synchronization
    between client and server for rescued objects within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: objectUpdateRescued
    description: The incoming object update rescued packet containing state information
      about a rescued object. This packet includes data such as object GUID, position,
      health, and other relevant attributes that need to be synchronized with the
      server's internal state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in WorldSession
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleObjectUpdateRescuedOpcode(WorldPackets::Misc::ObjectUpdateRescued&\
      \ objectUpdateRescued)\n{\n    // Process the rescued object update\n    Object*\
      \ obj = GetPlayer()->GetMap()->GetGameObject(objectUpdateRescued.Guid);\n  \
      \  if (obj)\n    {\n        // Update object state based on packet data\n  \
      \      obj->UpdatePosition(objectUpdateRescued.Position);\n        obj->SetHealth(objectUpdateRescued.Health);\n\
      \    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically called as part of the WorldSession's packet processing
    pipeline. It should be noted that proper error handling and validation of incoming
    packet data is essential to prevent potential exploits or server instability.
    The method assumes that the object GUID in the packet corresponds to a valid object
    within the current map context.
  warnings: Improper handling of this opcode can lead to synchronization issues between
    client and server, potentially causing visual glitches or game state inconsistencies.
    Developers should ensure that all object updates are properly validated before
    applying changes to prevent unauthorized modifications to game objects.
