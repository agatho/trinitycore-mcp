  class: ChallengeModeData
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ChallengeModeData::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player *
    owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes challenge mode data to a ByteBuffer for transmission to a player.
  description: 'The WriteCreate method serializes challenge mode data into a ByteBuffer
    format suitable for network transmission. This method is typically used when sending
    challenge mode information, such as dungeon keys or completion times, from the
    server to a client player. The serialized data includes relevant metadata about
    the challenge mode instance and its current state. The method takes two player
    references: one for the owner of the data and one for the receiver, which may
    be used to determine access permissions or data filtering. This is part of the
    World of Warcraft TrinityCore framework''s handling of dynamic content that changes
    based on player progress.'
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized challenge mode data
      will be written.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the challenge
      mode data. Used for determining permissions and data context.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the serialized data.
      May be used for filtering or personalization of the transmitted information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a challenge mode handler
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = player1;

      Player* receiver = player2;

      challengeModeData.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send ''data'' to receiver''s client

      receiver->SendDirectMessage(&data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during network synchronization events or
    when a challenge mode instance needs to be communicated to players. It's designed
    to be efficient and avoid unnecessary data duplication by using the provided ByteBuffer
    directly.
