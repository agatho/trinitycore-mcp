  class: PrioritizedAction
  method: PrioritizedAction
  signature: void PrioritizedAction::PrioritizedAction(uint32 spell, ActionPriority
    prio, float sc, int * tgt)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a prioritized action with spell ID, priority level, scaling factor,
    and target index.
  description: The PrioritizedAction constructor initializes an action object used
    in AI decision-making systems within TrinityCore. It sets up the action's associated
    spell identifier, its execution priority, a scaling coefficient that influences
    action weight, and optionally assigns a target index for the action. This method
    is typically used by AI scripts to define actions that can be prioritized during
    combat or non-combat scenarios. The spell ID corresponds to an entry in the spell
    database, while the priority level determines the order of execution among competing
    actions. The scaling factor allows for dynamic adjustment of action weights based
    on situational context, and the target index specifies which entity (if any) the
    action should be directed toward.
  parameters:
  - name: spell
    description: The spell identifier (Spell ID) that this prioritized action will
      execute. Must correspond to a valid spell entry in the TrinityCore database.
  - name: prio
    description: The priority level of this action, determining its order of execution
      relative to other actions. Higher values indicate higher priority.
  - name: sc
    description: The scaling factor that modifies the action's weight or effectiveness.
      Used for dynamic adjustment based on situational context such as health percentage
      or distance.
  - name: tgt
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index. If null, no
      specific target is assigned; otherwise, points to a valid target in the AI's
      target list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PrioritizedAction Initialization
    code: PrioritizedAction action(12345, ActionPriority::HIGH, 1.0f, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  - title: PrioritizedAction with Target Assignment
    code: 'int targetIndex = 0;

      PrioritizedAction action(67890, ActionPriority::MEDIUM, 0.8f, &targetIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system's internal action management framework
    and should be used primarily within AI behavior scripts or modules that implement
    custom combat logic. The target index parameter must point to a valid integer;
    passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not pass uninitialized pointers for the 'tgt' parameter without ensuring
    they are properly initialized before use. Incorrectly setting the spell ID to
    an invalid value will result in failed action execution during runtime.
