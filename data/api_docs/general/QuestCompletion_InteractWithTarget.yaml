    & objective, uint32 targetGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Handles interaction with a quest objective target for a player bot
  description: The InteractWithTarget method processes the interaction between a player
    bot and a specific quest objective target. It is typically invoked when a bot
    needs to interact with an object, NPC, or item that is part of a quest requirement.
    This method handles the necessary game logic such as updating quest progress,
    triggering related events, and managing the state of the quest objective. The
    method ensures that the interaction aligns with the quest's requirements and updates
    the player's quest data accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will interact
      with the target
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to QuestObjectiveData containing information about the
      specific quest objective being fulfilled
  - name: targetGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the target object that the bot is interacting
      with
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interaction Example
    code: 'QuestCompletion completion;

      Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      QuestObjectiveData objective = ...; // Get quest objective data

      uint32 targetGuid = 12345;

      completion.InteractWithTarget(bot, objective, targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Interaction with Validation
    code: "QuestCompletion completion;\nPlayer* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot\
      \ player\nQuestObjectiveData objective = ...; // Get quest objective data\n\
      uint32 targetGuid = 12345;\nif (bot && objective.IsValid()) {\n    completion.InteractWithTarget(bot,\
      \ objective, targetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest completion system and should be called only
    when a bot has successfully located and interacted with a required quest objective.
    The method assumes that all necessary preconditions for interaction are already
    satisfied by the calling code.
  warnings: Ensure that the targetGuid corresponds to an actual valid object in the
    game world; otherwise, the interaction may fail silently or cause unexpected behavior.
    Do not call this method without verifying that the bot is capable of interacting
    with the specified objective.
