  class: OutdoorPvP
  method: TeamCastSpell
  signature: void OutdoorPvP::TeamCastSpell(int team, int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Casts a spell on all players belonging to the specified team within the OutdoorPvP
    area.
  description: The TeamCastSpell method is used in OutdoorPvP systems to apply a specific
    spell effect to all players who are part of a given team (Horde or Alliance) currently
    present in the OutdoorPvP zone. This method typically serves game mechanics such
    as buffing players during territorial control, applying debuffs when capturing
    objectives, or triggering area-wide effects. The method does not validate if the
    spell is actually castable or if the player meets prerequisites; it simply broadcasts
    the spell to all eligible players on the specified team. It's commonly used in
    conjunction with OutdoorPvP objective captures and zone-based events.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier for which to cast the spell. Valid values are
      0 (Horde) or 1 (Alliance).
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell to be cast on players. Must correspond to a valid
      spell in the game's spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Cast Healing Spell on Alliance Players
    code: "OutdoorPvP* pvp = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvPToZoneId(1234);\nif (pvp)\n\
      {\n    pvp->TeamCastSpell(1, 52014); // Cast Healing Wave on Alliance players\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Apply Buff to Horde Players in PvP Zone
    code: "OutdoorPvP* pvp = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvPToZoneId(5678);\nif (pvp)\n\
      {\n    pvp->TeamCastSpell(0, 32175); // Cast Battle Shout on Horde players\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method broadcasts the spell effect to all players in the OutdoorPvP
    zone belonging to the specified team. It does not perform any validation of whether
    the spell is valid or if the player can receive it. The spell ID must be a valid
    spell that exists in the game's database, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
    This method should only be called from within an OutdoorPvP context where players
    are actively participating in PvP.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid team IDs (not 0 or 1) may result in unexpected
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the spellId corresponds to a valid spell in the
    game's database. This method should not be used outside of OutdoorPvP zones as
    it may cause issues with player state and spell effects.
