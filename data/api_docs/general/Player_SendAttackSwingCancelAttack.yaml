documentation:
  brief: Sends an attack swing cancel message to the player's client
  description: This method sends a cancel attack swing packet to the player's client,
    indicating that an attack has been cancelled. It is typically used when a player's
    attack is interrupted or when the player switches to a different target during
    an attack. The method ensures that the client properly updates its attack state
    and removes any pending attack animations. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    proper game mechanics and preventing visual inconsistencies in combat.

      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when an attack is interrupted or cancelled,
    such as when a player switches targets or when the player's attack is interrupted
    by certain effects. It should be used in conjunction with other combat-related
    methods to ensure proper synchronization of client-side attack states.
  warnings: This method should not be called during active combat unless necessary,
    as it may cause visual inconsistencies if not properly synchronized with other
    attack-related methods. Improper use can lead to client-side display issues or
    incorrect attack animations.
