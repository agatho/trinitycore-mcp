  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: ProcessMovingPhase
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::ProcessMovingPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the current moving phase for NPC interactions within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The ProcessMovingPhase method handles the logic and state transitions
    associated with an NPC's movement during interaction sequences. This includes
    managing waypoints, pathfinding, animation states, and updating the NPC's position
    in response to player actions or environmental triggers. The method is typically
    invoked as part of the NPC's AI update cycle to ensure smooth and realistic movement
    behavior during dialogue or quest-related interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC AI Update
    code: "void npc_example::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_npc->GetPhaseMask()\
      \ & PHASE_MASK_INTERACTION)\n        m_interactionManager->ProcessMovingPhase();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during NPC AI updates to maintain
    consistent movement behavior. It may internally trigger path recalculations or
    waypoint adjustments depending on the current interaction state.
  warnings: Ensure that the NPC is in an active interaction phase before calling this
    method, otherwise it may cause unexpected behavior or errors due to missing context
    data.
