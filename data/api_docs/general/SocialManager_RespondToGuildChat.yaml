documentation:
  brief: Processes a guild chat message response from a player
  description: The RespondToGuildChat method handles incoming guild chat messages
    sent by a player, validating the message content and processing it according to
    guild chat rules. It ensures that the player has proper guild permissions and
    that the message adheres to server chat restrictions before broadcasting the message
    to all guild members. This method is typically invoked when a player sends a message
    in the guild chat channel.
  parameters:
  - name: sender
    description: Pointer to the Player object who sent the guild chat message. Must
      be a valid player instance with an active guild membership.
  - name: message
    description: The actual text message sent by the player. Should not exceed maximum
      chat message length limits and must not contain prohibited content or spam patterns.
  returns: Returns true if the guild chat message was successfully processed and broadcast
    to the guild, false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid sender, message
    restrictions, or permission issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Chat Response
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player instance\nstd::string msg = \"Hello\
      \ guild!\";\nbool success = sSocialMgr->RespondToGuildChat(player, msg);\nif\
      \ (success) {\n    // Message was sent successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal validation checks including message length
    limits, prohibited word filtering, and player guild membership verification. It
    is part of the core social system and should not be called directly from external
    modules without proper context.
  warnings: Do not call this method with null player pointers or empty messages as
    it may cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is fully initialized
    and has valid guild data before invoking this function.
