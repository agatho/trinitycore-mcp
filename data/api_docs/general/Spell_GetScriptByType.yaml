  method: GetScriptByType
  signature: SpellScript * Spell::GetScriptByType(const std::type_info & type) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the SpellScript associated with a specific type from the spell's
    script registry.
  description: This method allows developers to access a specific SpellScript instance
    by its type information, enabling dynamic script handling and execution within
    the TrinityCore framework. It serves as a key interface for retrieving scripts
    based on their type, which is essential for implementing custom spell behaviors
    and mechanics. The method operates on a per-spell basis, allowing for precise
    control over script retrieval and execution. This functionality is particularly
    useful when working with custom spell implementations or when needing to access
    specific script types during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the SpellScript instance matching the specified type.
    If no matching script is found, it returns nullptr, indicating that the script
    type was not registered or available for this particular spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Script Retrieval
    code: "SpellScript* script = spell->GetScriptByType(typeid(SpellScript));\nif\
      \ (script != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the script\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related APIs
    to manage script execution and behavior. It requires proper type registration
    for scripts to be accessible, and performance considerations should be taken into
    account when using this method frequently.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can lead to memory issues
    if not handled properly. Ensure that the returned pointer is valid and that the
    script type exists before attempting to use it. Also, avoid calling this method
    during spell initialization or execution to prevent potential deadlocks.
