  class: QFunction
  method: Update
  signature: void QFunction::Update(const Experience & exp, float learningRate, float
    discountFactor)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Q-function with new experience data using specified learning
    and discount rates.
  description: The Update method is used to modify the Q-function values based on
    newly acquired experience, applying a learning rate to determine how much new
    information overrides existing knowledge, and a discount factor to weigh future
    rewards. This method is typically part of reinforcement learning implementations
    within the game's AI systems, where it helps NPCs or game entities improve their
    decision-making over time by adjusting action-value estimates. The method does
    not return any value but modifies internal state of the QFunction object.
  parameters:
  - name: exp
    description: Reference to an Experience object containing the new experience data
      including state, action, reward, and next state for updating the Q-values.
  - name: learningRate
    description: Float value representing the learning rate (alpha), determining how
      quickly new information overrides old estimates. Typical values range from 0.0
      to 1.0.
  - name: discountFactor
    description: Float value representing the discount factor (gamma), determining
      the importance of future rewards. Values typically range from 0.0 to 1.0, where
      higher values prioritize long-term rewards.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Q-function update with experience
    code: 'QFunction qFunc;

      Experience exp;

      // Initialize exp with state, action, reward, next_state

      qFunc.Update(exp, 0.1f, 0.9f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Q-function during AI training loop
    code: "QFunction aiQFunc;\nfloat lr = 0.05f;\nfloat gamma = 0.95f;\nfor (const\
      \ auto& experience : trainingData) {\n    aiQFunc.Update(experience, lr, gamma);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Q-function has been initialized with appropriate
    state-action pairs and that the Experience object contains valid data. It is designed
    to be used in a reinforcement learning context where continuous updates are made
    as new experiences are observed.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values for learningRate or discountFactor can lead
    to unstable or non-converging Q-value updates. Ensure that these parameters are
    within reasonable bounds (typically [0.0, 1.0]) to maintain stable learning behavior.
