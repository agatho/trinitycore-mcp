  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GenerateFollowPath
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::GenerateFollowPath(Player * bot, const int
    & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a follow path for a bot player to move toward a specified destination.
  description: The GenerateFollowPath method calculates and sets up a movement path
    for a bot player to follow towards a given destination. This method is typically
    used in AI behavior systems where bots need to dynamically determine how to navigate
    to a target location while following the leader. It handles pathfinding logic
    internally, ensuring that the bot moves efficiently and realistically within the
    game world. The method returns true if the path generation was successful and
    false otherwise, indicating potential issues such as invalid destination coordinates
    or failed pathfinding.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will follow
      the path. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: destination
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the destination identifier
      or coordinate for the bot to follow towards. The exact meaning depends on implementation
      context.
  returns: Returns true if the path generation was successful and the bot can begin
    following the path, false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid destination,
    unreachable location, or internal pathfinding errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GenerateFollowPath
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get a valid bot player\nint dest = 12345; // Destination\
      \ identifier\nif (leaderFollowBehavior->GenerateFollowPath(bot, dest)) {\n \
      \   // Path generated successfully, bot will start following\n    bot->SetMovementFlags(MOVEFLAG_FOLLOW);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle path generation failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to generate follow path for bot %u\", bot->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LeaderFollowBehavior AI system and assumes that
    the bot has been properly initialized with valid movement capabilities. Pathfinding
    may be affected by terrain, obstacles, or server-side restrictions in the game
    world.
  warnings: Ensure that the destination parameter is valid and reachable before calling
    this method to avoid unnecessary processing or errors. The method does not validate
    the destination directly but relies on the underlying pathfinding system for validation.
