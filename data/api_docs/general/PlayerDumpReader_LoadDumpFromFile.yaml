documentation:
  brief: Loads player data from a dump file into the database
  description: The LoadDumpFromFile method reads player character data from a specified
    dump file and imports it into the TrinityCore database. This method is typically
    used for bulk character restoration, migration, or debugging purposes. It validates
    the account ID, character name, and GUID before attempting to load the data. The
    method handles various error conditions and returns appropriate status codes indicating
    success or failure of the operation.
  parameters:
  - name: file
    description: Path to the dump file containing player data in TrinityCore format
  - name: account
    description: Account ID that will own the character being loaded
  - name: name
    description: Character name to assign to the loaded character
  - name: guid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) to assign to the character
  returns: DumpReturn enum value indicating success or failure of the load operation.
    Possible values include DUMP_SUCCESS, DUMP_FILE_ERROR, DUMP_ACCOUNT_ERROR, DUMP_NAME_ERROR,
    and DUMP_GUID_ERROR.
  examples:
  - title: Basic character dump loading
    code: "PlayerDumpReader reader;\nDumpReturn result = reader.LoadDumpFromFile(\"\
      /path/to/player_dump.txt\", 12345, \"TestCharacter\", 54321);\nif (result ==\
      \ DUMP_SUCCESS) {\n    printf(\"Character loaded successfully\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    printf(\"Failed to load character: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires proper file permissions to read the dump file. The dump
    file must be in the correct TrinityCore format or the operation will fail. The
    account ID must exist in the database, and the character name must be unique within
    the account.
  warnings: Attempting to load a dump with an existing GUID or character name will
    result in failure. Ensure that the target account exists before calling this method.
    Improper file formats may cause undefined behavior or database corruption.
