  class: Loot
  method: SetItemContext
  signature: void Loot::SetItemContext(int context)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the context identifier for the loot object, determining how loot is
    distributed among players.
  description: The SetItemContext method assigns a context value to a Loot object,
    which influences how loot items are processed and distributed within the World
    of Warcraft game mechanics. This context typically determines whether the loot
    is from a specific source such as a creature, game object, or quest reward, and
    affects the loot distribution rules including group vs. individual loot settings.
    The method does not validate the context value but stores it for later use during
    loot processing. When called, this method updates an internal member variable
    that may be referenced by other systems when determining loot eligibility and
    distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: An integer value representing the context identifier for the loot.
      This value determines how the loot is processed and distributed, such as whether
      it's from a creature, game object, or quest. Valid values are typically defined
      by the game system and can influence loot rules like group loot vs. individual
      loot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting loot context for creature loot
    code: 'Loot* loot = new Loot();

      loot->SetItemContext(LOOT_CONTEXT_CREATURE);

      // This sets the loot to be processed as creature loot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting custom loot context for quest rewards
    code: 'Loot* questLoot = player->GetLoot();

      questLoot->SetItemContext(LOOT_CONTEXT_QUEST);

      // This ensures quest-related loot is handled according to quest-specific rules'
    language: cpp
  notes: The context value set by this method is typically used internally by the
    TrinityCore server to determine appropriate loot processing behavior. It's important
    to note that this method only stores the context and does not trigger any immediate
    loot processing or distribution. The actual use of the context value depends on
    other systems within the core that evaluate loot eligibility and distribution
    rules.
  warnings: This method should be called before any loot processing occurs, as changing
    the context after loot has been initialized may lead to inconsistent behavior.
    Additionally, using invalid context values might result in unexpected loot distribution
    or processing errors depending on how the server code interprets these values.
