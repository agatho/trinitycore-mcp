  method: OptimizationStrategy
  signature: void OptimizationStrategy::OptimizationStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the optimization strategy for performance tuning in TrinityCore.
  description: The OptimizationStrategy constructor initializes internal data structures
    and settings required for applying various optimization techniques within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method sets up default configuration values, registers
    necessary callbacks, and prepares the system for subsequent optimization operations.
    It is typically invoked during server startup or when a new optimization context
    needs to be established. The initialization process may involve loading optimization
    profiles from configuration files, setting up performance monitoring hooks, and
    preparing memory allocation strategies tailored for World of Warcraft's specific
    requirements.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'OptimizationStrategy strategy;

      // The constructor automatically initializes all required components

      strategy.OptimizationStrategy(); // This is implicitly called during object
      creation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per instance, as repeated invocations
    may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The initialization process is
    not thread-safe and should be performed in a single-threaded context before any
    concurrent operations begin.
  warnings: Calling this constructor multiple times on the same object without proper
    cleanup can result in memory corruption or unexpected performance degradation.
    Ensure that all optimization resources are properly managed and released when
    no longer needed.
