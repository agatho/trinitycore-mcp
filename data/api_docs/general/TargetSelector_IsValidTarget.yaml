  class: TargetSelector
  method: IsValidTarget
  signature: bool TargetSelector::IsValidTarget(Unit * target, TargetValidation validation)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a given unit meets the criteria for being a valid target
    based on specified validation rules.
  description: The IsValidTarget method determines if a Unit object is considered
    a valid target according to the provided TargetValidation settings. This method
    is typically used within AI systems and spell targeting logic to filter out invalid
    or undesirable targets. It performs checks such as whether the target is alive,
    visible, in range, or meets specific faction or health conditions depending on
    the validation type. The method ensures that only appropriate units are selected
    for actions like casting spells, melee attacks, or other targeted abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being evaluated as a potential
      target. Can be nullptr, in which case the method will return false.
  - name: validation
    description: TargetValidation enum value specifying the criteria for validation.
      This determines what checks are performed on the target such as hostility, visibility,
      health status, and faction relationships.
  returns: Returns true if the target passes all validation checks specified by the
    TargetValidation parameter; otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates
    that the unit is not suitable for targeting under the given validation rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (targetSelector->IsValidTarget(enemyUnit, TargetValidation::HOSTILE))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with attack or spell casting\n    caster->CastSpell(enemyUnit,\
      \ SPELL_FIREBALL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for valid healing targets
    code: "if (targetSelector->IsValidTarget(allyUnit, TargetValidation::HEALING))\
      \ {\n    // Cast healing spell on ally\n    caster->CastSpell(allyUnit, SPELL_HEAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI decision-making processes where target
    selection must adhere to strict rules. The TargetValidation enum may include values
    such as HOSTILE, FRIENDLY, HEALING, or RANGE_CHECK which dictate different validation
    behaviors. Performance-wise, this method should be efficient since it's called
    frequently during combat logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is not null before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. Be aware that different TargetValidation types may
    have varying performance implications depending on how many checks are performed
    internally.
