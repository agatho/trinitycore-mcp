  signature: void Spell::TriggerGlobalCooldown()
documentation:
  brief: Triggers the global cooldown for the spell's caster, preventing them from
    casting another spell for a specified duration.
  description: The TriggerGlobalCooldown method initiates the global cooldown period
    for the player or unit that cast the spell. In World of Warcraft mechanics, this
    prevents the caster from immediately casting another spell after using this one.
    The global cooldown typically lasts 1.5 seconds and is applied to all spells except
    those with special exceptions (like instant casts). This method ensures proper
    game balance by preventing spamming of abilities and maintaining a consistent
    combat rhythm. It modifies the caster's cooldown state internally without requiring
    explicit parameters.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect Handler
    code: "void Spell::EffectDummy(SpellEffIndex effIndex)\n{\n    // ... spell logic\
      \ ...\n    TriggerGlobalCooldown();\n    // ... more logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "void Spell::SpellEffect(SpellEffIndex effIndex)\n{\n    if (GetCaster()->IsPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        Player* player = GetCaster()->ToPlayer();\n        if (player->HasSpellCooldown(12345))\
      \ // Example spell\n            return;\n        \n        TriggerGlobalCooldown();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects the caster's global cooldown and does not influence
    other types of cooldowns. It should be called after spell effects are processed
    to ensure proper timing. The global cooldown is handled internally by the player's
    unit data structure, so no manual cooldown management is required.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the spell actually triggered
    a global cooldown (e.g., for instant spells) may result in unintended behavior.
    Always ensure that the spell has appropriate cooldown requirements before invoking
    this function.
