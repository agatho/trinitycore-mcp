  method: OnInterruptRequired
  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::OnInterruptRequired(int * target,
    uint32 param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the required interrupt event for beast mastery hunter abilities
  description: The OnInterruptRequired method is invoked when a beast mastery hunter's
    ability or spell requires an interrupt to be processed. This method typically
    manages the logic for handling interrupts during pet actions, such as when a hunter's
    pet is interrupted while casting a spell or performing an attack. The method takes
    a target reference and a parameter value that may influence how the interrupt
    is handled. It is part of the core AI behavior system for beast mastery hunters
    in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object that is being interrupted. This represents
      the unit or entity whose action is being interrupted, such as a pet or enemy.
  - name: param1
    description: A uint32 parameter that may contain interrupt type, priority, or
      other contextual data used to determine how the interrupt should be processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Handling
    code: "void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::OnInterruptRequired(int* target, uint32\
      \ param1) {\n    if (target && *target != 0) {\n        // Process interrupt\
      \ logic for the target\n        HandleInterrupt(*target, param1);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Interrupt with Priority
    code: "void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::OnInterruptRequired(int* target, uint32\
      \ param1) {\n    if (!target || *target <= 0) return;\n    \n    // Determine\
      \ interrupt priority based on param1\n    switch (param1) {\n        case INTERRUPT_PRIORITY_HIGH:\n\
      \            // High-priority interrupt logic\n            break;\n        case\
      \ INTERRUPT_PRIORITY_LOW:\n            // Low-priority interrupt logic\n   \
      \         break;\n        default:\n            // Default interrupt handling\n\
      \            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop or spell interruption
    handlers. It's important to ensure that the target pointer is valid before dereferencing
    it. The param1 value should be validated to avoid unexpected behavior during interrupt
    processing.
  warnings: Do not assume that the target pointer will always be valid. Always perform
    null checks before using the target. Improper handling of param1 may lead to incorrect
    interrupt behaviors or crashes.
