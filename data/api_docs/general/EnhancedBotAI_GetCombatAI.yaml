  method: GetCombatAI
  signature: CombatAIIntegrator * EnhancedBotAI::GetCombatAI() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the combat AI integrator instance associated with this enhanced
    bot AI.
  description: The GetCombatAI method returns a pointer to the CombatAIIntegrator
    object that manages the combat behavior logic for the enhanced bot. This integrator
    is responsible for handling all combat-related decisions, including target selection,
    spell casting, and tactical positioning. The returned pointer is typically valid
    during the bot's active gameplay session and should be used carefully to avoid
    dangling references. This method serves as a key interface point for accessing
    and manipulating the bot's combat intelligence subsystem within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the CombatAIIntegrator instance that controls the enhanced
    bot's combat behavior, or nullptr if no combat AI has been initialized or assigned
    to this bot instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CombatAIIntegrator* combatAI = bot->GetCombatAI();\nif (combatAI != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the combat AI for behavior control\n    combatAI->UpdateAI();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Combat AI State
    code: "EnhancedBotAI* botAI = player->GetBotAI();\nCombatAIIntegrator* combatAI\
      \ = botAI->GetCombatAI();\nif (combatAI != nullptr)\n{\n    // Verify that combat\
      \ AI is properly initialized\n    if (combatAI->IsInCombat())\n    {\n     \
      \   // Bot is currently engaged in combat\n        combatAI->SetTarget(targetUnit);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned CombatAIIntegrator pointer should not be deleted or managed
    by the caller. It represents an internal component owned and managed by the EnhancedBotAI
    instance. Accessing this pointer after the bot has been destroyed may result in
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned pointer is valid without checking for nullptr.
    The combat AI may not be initialized until the bot enters combat or is explicitly
    configured with combat capabilities. Using an uninitialized combat AI can lead
    to crashes or unexpected behavior.
