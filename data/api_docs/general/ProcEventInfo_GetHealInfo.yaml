  signature: HealInfo * ProcEventInfo::GetHealInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the HealInfo object associated with the proc event, containing
    detailed healing information.
  description: The GetHealInfo method returns a pointer to the HealInfo object that
    contains comprehensive details about a healing event triggered by a proc. This
    includes information such as the amount healed, the healing spell ID, the target
    of the heal, and other relevant healing parameters. The returned HealInfo object
    is valid only during the execution of the proc handler and should not be stored
    or accessed after the method call completes. This method is commonly used in custom
    spell effects, procs, and aura implementations to access detailed healing data
    when a healing event occurs.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the HealInfo object associated with the current proc event.
    Returns nullptr if no heal information is available or if the proc event was not
    related to a healing action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Proc Handler
    code: "void MySpell::HandleProc(Unit* target, ProcEventInfo& eventInfo)\n{\n \
      \   HealInfo* healInfo = eventInfo.GetHealInfo();\n    if (healInfo)\n    {\n\
      \        uint32 healedAmount = healInfo->GetHeal();\n        // Process the\
      \ healing amount\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Healing Spell ID
    code: "void MyAura::HandleProc(Unit* target, ProcEventInfo& eventInfo)\n{\n  \
      \  HealInfo* healInfo = eventInfo.GetHealInfo();\n    if (healInfo)\n    {\n\
      \        uint32 spellId = healInfo->GetSpellInfo()->Id;\n        // Use spell\
      \ ID for conditional logic\n        if (spellId == 12345)\n        {\n     \
      \       // Apply special effect for specific healing spell\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The HealInfo object returned by this method is managed internally by the
    proc system and should not be deleted or modified. Accessing the HealInfo after
    the proc handler completes may result in undefined behavior. The method will return
    nullptr if the proc event was not triggered by a healing action, such as when
    it's related to damage, mana regeneration, or other non-healing events.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer for later use as it may become invalid
    after the proc handler finishes executing. Always check for null before using
    the returned HealInfo object to prevent crashes. This method should only be called
    from within a valid proc event context where healing information is actually available.
