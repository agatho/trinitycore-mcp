  brief: Moves a channel object to a new location using move semantics
  description: The Channel::Channel constructor is a move constructor that transfers
    ownership of resources from a temporary Channel object to the newly constructed
    Channel object. This allows for efficient resource management by avoiding unnecessary
    copying of channel data structures. The method is typically used internally during
    object creation or assignment operations where a temporary Channel instance needs
    to be moved into a persistent one. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    server implementation, this constructor handles the transfer of channel membership
    lists, permissions, and other channel-specific data without duplicating memory
    allocations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Channel Construction
    code: 'Channel* newChannel = new Channel(std::move(tempChannel));

      // tempChannel is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Channel Assignment with Move Semantics
    code: 'Channel channel1;

      Channel channel2 = std::move(channel1);

      // channel1 is left in a valid but undefined state

      // channel2 now owns all resources from channel1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor follows standard C++ move semantics. After the move operation,
    the source object should not be used for any operations that require valid channel
    state. The implementation assumes that the moved-from object is in a valid state
    but may have undefined contents after the move.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after this operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure all references to the original object are invalidated before
    calling this constructor. This method should not be called directly in most user
    code - it's typically invoked automatically during move operations.
