documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the creation properties associated with this area trigger.
  description: The GetCreateProperties method returns a constant pointer to the AreaTriggerCreateProperties
    object that defines how this area trigger was originally created. This includes
    essential data such as the trigger's position, scale, orientation, and other initialization
    parameters. The returned properties are immutable and represent the static configuration
    used when the area trigger was first spawned in the world. This method is typically
    used by the core system to access the baseline data needed for maintaining or
    replicating the area trigger's state across different contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an AreaTriggerCreateProperties object that contains
    the initialization data for this area trigger, or nullptr if no creation properties
    are available.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Area Trigger Creation Properties
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume a valid area trigger instance\nconst\
      \ AreaTriggerCreateProperties* props = trigger->GetCreateProperties();\nif (props)\n\
      {\n    // Use properties to access initial position, scale, etc.\n    Position\
      \ pos = props->GetPosition();\n    float scale = props->GetScale();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer should not be modified as it points to immutable creation
    data. The method is safe to call from any thread context where the area trigger
    object is accessible.
