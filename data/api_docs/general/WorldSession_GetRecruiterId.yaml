  class: WorldSession
  method: GetRecruiterId
  signature: uint32 WorldSession::GetRecruiterId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the recruiter ID of the player associated with this session.
  description: The GetRecruiterId method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the player who recruited the current player. This is used in the World of Warcraft
    'Recruit a Friend' system, where players can invite others to join the game and
    earn rewards for successful recruitment. The method returns zero if the player
    has no recruiter or if the recruiter information is not yet loaded. This value
    is typically set during player creation or when a player accepts an invitation
    from another player.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the GUID of the recruiting player. Returns
    0 if no recruiter exists or the recruiter data is unavailable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 recruiterId = session->GetRecruiterId();\nif (recruiterId != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Player was recruited by another player\n    sLog->outString(\"Player\
      \ recruited by: %u\", recruiterId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player has no recruiter\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player has no recruiter\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Recruitment Status
    code: "void HandleRecruitmentStatus(WorldPacket& data)\n{\n    uint32 recruiterId\
      \ = session->GetRecruiterId();\n    if (recruiterId != 0)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Send recruitment status to client\n        WorldPacket response(SMSG_RECruit_A_Friend_Response,\
      \ 4);\n        response << uint32(1); // Success\n        session->SendPacket(&response);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        WorldPacket response(SMSG_RECruit_A_Friend_Response,\
      \ 4);\n        response << uint32(0); // No recruiter\n        session->SendPacket(&response);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with player recruitment mechanics
    and may return zero if the recruiter data has not been fully initialized. The
    returned ID corresponds to the GUID of another player in the database, which can
    be used to query additional information about the recruiter.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this value for direct database queries without
    proper validation, as it may be zero or invalid during certain session states.
    Ensure that any logic depending on this value handles the zero case appropriately.
