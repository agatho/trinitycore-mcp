  signature: bool PlayerbotConfig::LoadConfigFile(const std::string & filePath)
documentation:
  brief: Loads the player bot configuration from the specified file path
  description: The LoadConfigFile method reads and parses a configuration file for
    player bots, initializing their behavior settings and parameters. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when reloading bot configurations.
    It validates the file path and ensures the configuration data is properly loaded
    into memory. The method handles various configuration sections including bot classes,
    behaviors, and AI decision-making parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: filePath
    description: The absolute or relative path to the configuration file to be loaded.
      Must point to a valid .conf or .json file containing player bot settings.
  returns: Returns true if the configuration file was successfully loaded and parsed,
    false otherwise. A return value of false indicates either file not found, invalid
    format, or parsing errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Loading
    code: "PlayerbotConfig config;\nbool success = config.LoadConfigFile(\"config/playerbot.conf\"\
      );\nif (success) {\n    // Configuration loaded successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      playerbot\", \"Player bot configuration loaded successfully\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle loading failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Failed to load\
      \ player bot configuration\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuration Loading with Error Handling
    code: "PlayerbotConfig config;\nstd::string configFile = \"config/playerbot_custom.conf\"\
      ;\nif (config.LoadConfigFile(configFile)) {\n    LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\", \"\
      Custom bot configuration loaded successfully\");\n    // Proceed with bot initialization\n\
      } else {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Could not load custom bot config: {}\"\
      , configFile);\n    // Fallback to default configuration\n    config.LoadConfigFile(\"\
      config/playerbot.conf\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when administrators
    need to reload bot configurations without restarting the server. The configuration
    file format should match the expected schema for player bots, otherwise loading
    will fail. Multiple calls to this method may overwrite previous configuration
    settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the specified file path exists and has proper read permissions.
    Loading malformed configuration files can cause undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method should not be called from multiple threads simultaneously without
    proper synchronization.
