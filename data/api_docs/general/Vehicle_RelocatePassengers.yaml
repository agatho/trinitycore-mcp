  class: Vehicle
  method: RelocatePassengers
  signature: void Vehicle::RelocatePassengers()
documentation:
  brief: Relocates all passengers aboard the vehicle to match the vehicle's current
    position and orientation.
  description: The RelocatePassengers method updates the positions and orientations
    of all passengers currently mounted on the vehicle to align with the vehicle's
    current location in the world. This ensures that passengers remain properly positioned
    relative to the vehicle during movement, including when the vehicle teleports,
    moves, or changes orientation. The method is typically invoked internally by the
    game engine during vehicle updates or when the vehicle's position changes significantly.
    It handles both players and non-player characters (NPCs) who are seated on the
    vehicle.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Vehicle Update Loop
    code: "void Vehicle::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    if (HasPassengers())\n    {\n        RelocatePassengers();\n    }\n   \
      \ // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically by the core engine during vehicle
    movement updates. Developers should not typically need to call it directly unless
    implementing custom vehicle behavior. The method uses internal passenger tracking
    and does not require explicit passenger management.
  warnings: Calling this method manually when passengers are not properly seated on
    the vehicle may lead to incorrect positioning or unexpected behavior. Ensure that
    all passengers have valid seat assignments before invoking this method.
