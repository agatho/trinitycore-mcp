  notes: This method should be called only when the player is in a valid state, typically
    during character creation or when updating bank tab configurations. The implementation
    involves database updates and may require synchronization with client-side changes.
  warnings: The method requires that tabId be within valid range (0-11). Improper
    tabId values can lead to invalid bank tab configurations or errors in the database.
    Also, this method should not be called during gameplay when the player is already
    in a state where bank tabs are being accessed.
