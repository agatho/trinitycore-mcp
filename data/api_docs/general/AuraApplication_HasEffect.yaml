documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the aura application has a specific effect active.
  description: The HasEffect method determines if a particular aura effect (specified
    by its index) is currently active on the aura application. This method is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to evaluate the
    state of aura effects during combat, spell casting, or periodic tick events. It
    allows scripts and game logic to verify whether a specific effect of an aura is
    still applied to a unit, which can influence various gameplay mechanics such as
    damage over time, healing effects, or stat modifications. The method performs
    a simple lookup within the aura's internal effect tracking structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified effect index is currently active on this
    aura application; otherwise returns false. A return value of false may indicate
    that the effect has expired, been removed, or was never applied in the first place.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check for a Specific Effect
    code: "if (auraApp->HasEffect(0))\n{\n    // Effect 0 is currently active\n  \
      \  // Perform some action based on this effect being active\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HasEffect in a Combat Logic Check
    code: "AuraApplication* auraApp = unit->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (auraApp\
      \ && auraApp->HasEffect(1))\n{\n    // Apply additional damage or modify behavior\
      \ when effect 1 is active\n    unit->ModifyPower(POWER_MANA, -10);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the aura application's internal state and should
    only be called after verifying that the aura application exists. The effect index
    corresponds to the order in which effects were defined when the aura was created,
    typically aligned with spell effect indices. Performance is generally fast as
    it involves a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value means the effect will remain active
    for future ticks; effects can expire or be removed between calls. Always validate
    that the AuraApplication pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    potential crashes.
