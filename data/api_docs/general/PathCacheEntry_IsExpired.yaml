  class: PathCacheEntry
  method: IsExpired
  signature: bool PathCacheEntry::IsExpired(uint32 currentTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a path cache entry has expired based on the provided current
    time.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if a PathCacheEntry object is considered
    stale or no longer valid by comparing its internal expiration timestamp with the
    provided current time value. This mechanism ensures that cached navigation paths
    are not used beyond their intended lifetime, which is crucial for maintaining
    accurate AI behavior and avoiding outdated pathfinding data in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment. The method typically relies on internal state tracking
    of when the path was last updated or computed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the path cache entry has expired (i.e., its stored expiration
    time is less than or equal to the provided currentTime), indicating that a new
    path calculation should be performed. Returns false if the entry is still valid
    and can be safely used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Pathfinding Logic
    code: "if (pathCacheEntry.IsExpired(getCurrentTime())) {\n    // Recalculate path\n\
      \    calculateNewPath();\n} else {\n    // Use cached path\n    useCachedPath();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used within AI pathfinding systems where cached paths
    need periodic refreshing to account for dynamic changes in the game world such
    as moving obstacles or terrain modifications. It's important to note that expiration
    time logic may be based on fixed intervals or adaptive timeouts depending on implementation
    details.
