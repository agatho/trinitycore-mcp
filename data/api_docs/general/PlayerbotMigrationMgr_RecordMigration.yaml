documentation:
  brief: Records a migration entry with version, description, execution time, and
    checksum information
  description: The RecordMigration method stores migration details into the database
    or internal tracking system. It logs essential metadata about a migration process
    including the target version, descriptive notes, how long the operation took to
    complete, and a checksum for integrity verification. This method is typically
    used during automated or manual database schema upgrades within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method returns true upon successful recording, or false if the
    operation fails due to database errors or invalid input parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: version
    description: The version string identifying the target migration (e.g., '3.3.5a').
      Must be a valid non-empty string representing the version being migrated to.
  - name: description
    description: A human-readable description of what this migration does or contains.
      Can be empty but should ideally provide context about the changes introduced
      by this migration.
  - name: executionTimeMs
    description: The time in milliseconds it took to execute the migration process.
      Should be a non-negative integer value representing actual execution duration.
  - name: checksum
    description: A checksum value used for verifying the integrity of the migration
      data. Typically a hash string (e.g., MD5 or SHA256) that uniquely identifies
      the migration content.
  returns: Returns true if the migration record was successfully stored in the system,
    false otherwise. Failure may occur due to database errors, invalid parameters,
    or write permissions issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Migration Recording
    code: "bool success = sPlayerbotMigrationMgr->RecordMigration(\"3.3.5a\", \"Update\
      \ to latest spell definitions and NPC AI\", 4500, \"a1b2c3d4e5f6\");\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_PLAYERBOT, \"Migration recorded successfully.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(LOG_FILTER_PLAYERBOT, \"Failed to record migration.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database through TrinityCore's standard
    database abstraction layer. It is expected to be thread-safe as part of the migration
    manager's design. The method may perform validation on input parameters before
    storing them.
  warnings: Ensure that the version string follows the expected format used by the
    system, otherwise it might cause inconsistencies in version tracking. Invalid
    checksums or execution times could lead to incorrect audit trails.
