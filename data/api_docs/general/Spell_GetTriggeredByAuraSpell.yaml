  signature: const SpellInfo * Spell::GetTriggeredByAuraSpell() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell that triggered the current aura.
  description: This method retrieves the SpellInfo structure of the spell that caused
    the current aura to be applied. It is commonly used in aura handling and spell
    mechanics to determine which spell initiated a specific aura effect. The method
    is particularly useful when examining the relationship between triggered spells
    and their originating aura spells, especially in cases where a spell may trigger
    another spell through an aura. This functionality is essential for understanding
    spell interactions and chain reactions in World of Warcraft's spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the SpellInfo structure of the spell that triggered
    the current aura. If no such spell exists, it returns nullptr. The returned pointer
    should not be modified or freed as it represents a static reference within the
    game's spell database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellInfo const* triggeredSpell = spell->GetTriggeredByAuraSpell();\nif\
      \ (triggeredSpell)\n{\n    // Process the triggered spell\n    printf(\"Triggered\
      \ by: %s\\n\", triggeredSpell->SpellName[0]);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other aura-related methods
    and should be called within contexts where the spell's aura state is known. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it simply returns a pointer to an existing structure,
    but developers should ensure proper handling of null pointers when using this
    method.
  warnings: The returned SpellInfo pointer may be nullptr if no triggering spell exists,
    so developers must always check for null before dereferencing the result. Also,
    this method is not thread-safe and should only be used in single-threaded contexts
    unless explicitly stated otherwise.
