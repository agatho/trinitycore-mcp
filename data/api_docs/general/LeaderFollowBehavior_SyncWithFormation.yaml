  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: SyncWithFormation
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::SyncWithFormation(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes the leader's follow behavior with the group formation.
  description: The SyncWithFormation method updates the leader's movement and positioning
    to align with the current group formation settings. This ensures that the leader
    maintains proper spacing and positioning relative to other group members when
    following a path or engaging in group activities. The method typically handles
    adjustments to the leader's movement speed, direction, and positioning within
    the group formation. It is commonly invoked during group transitions, formation
    changes, or when the leader needs to reposition itself within the group structure.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that contains the formation data and
      member information. This parameter is required and must point to a valid group
      instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group movement
    code: "void OnGroupFormed(Group* group)\n{\n    leaderFollowBehavior->SyncWithFormation(group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Synchronizing formation after member changes
    code: "void OnMemberAdded(Unit* member)\n{\n    if (Group* group = GetGroup())\n\
      \    {\n        leaderFollowBehavior->SyncWithFormation(group);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the group has a valid formation set.
    The implementation may adjust the leader's movement parameters to match the group's
    current formation settings, including distance from other members and positioning
    within the formation.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the group parameter is valid before calling
    SyncWithFormation.
