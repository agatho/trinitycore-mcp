  signature: void ThreatIntegrationExample::HandleMythicPlusAffixes(ThreatCoordinator
    * coordinator, uint32 activeAffixes)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and applies Mythic+ affixes to the threat coordination system
  description: The HandleMythicPlusAffixes method integrates active Mythic+ affixes
    into the threat coordinator's behavior, adjusting how threat is calculated and
    managed during Mythic+ dungeon runs. This method ensures that the unique mechanics
    introduced by each affix are properly accounted for in the overall threat system.
    The function takes the current active affixes and modifies the threat coordination
    logic accordingly, potentially altering enemy targeting, damage distribution,
    or player threat generation mechanics. This integration is crucial for maintaining
    balanced gameplay during Mythic+ dungeons where affixes significantly impact encounter
    difficulty and player strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: coordinator
    description: Pointer to the ThreatCoordinator instance that manages threat calculations
      and behavior
  - name: activeAffixes
    description: Bitmask representing currently active Mythic+ affixes, where each
      bit corresponds to a specific affix ID
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Encounter
    code: 'ThreatIntegrationExample example;

      ThreatCoordinator* coord = sThreatMgr->GetThreatCoordinator();

      uint32 affixes = 0x0000000F; // Example: first four affixes active

      example.HandleMythicPlusAffixes(coord, affixes);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Dungeon Start Event
    code: "void InstanceScript::OnMythicPlusStart()\n{\n    ThreatIntegrationExample\
      \ example;\n    example.HandleMythicPlusAffixes(sThreatMgr->GetThreatCoordinator(),\
      \ GetActiveAffixes());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ThreatCoordinator has been properly initialized
    and that the affix bitmask contains valid Mythic+ affix identifiers. The implementation
    should handle edge cases where no affixes are active or when multiple affixes
    are active simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the coordinator pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause a crash. Also, verify that the activeAffixes
    parameter contains valid Mythic+ affix IDs to prevent unexpected behavior in threat
    calculations.
