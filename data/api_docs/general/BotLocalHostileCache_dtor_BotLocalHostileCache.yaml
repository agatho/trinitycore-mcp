  signature: void BotLocalHostileCache::~BotLocalHostileCache()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotLocalHostileCache instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotLocalHostileCache class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used to maintain
    the cache of hostile targets. This method ensures proper resource deallocation
    when the cache object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI system, this cache likely stores information about nearby
    hostile units for bot decision-making processes, and its destruction prevents
    memory leaks and ensures clean shutdown of AI subsystems.

  - title: Automatic destruction of BotLocalHostileCache
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotLocalHostileCache cache;\n    // ... use\
      \ cache ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when cache goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when a BotLocalHostileCache
    object is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process typically
    involves releasing internal data structures and clearing any cached hostile target
    references.
