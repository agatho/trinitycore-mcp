  class: Creature
  method: InitEntry
  signature: bool Creature::InitEntry(uint32 entry, const CreatureData * data)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a creature entry with the specified creature data, setting up
    its base properties and configuration.
  description: The InitEntry method is responsible for initializing a Creature object
    with the provided entry ID and associated creature data. This method sets up the
    fundamental properties of the creature such as its display ID, faction, equipment,
    and other static attributes defined in the database. It typically gets called
    during creature creation or respawn processes to ensure that each creature instance
    is properly configured according to its template in the database. The method returns
    true if initialization was successful, false otherwise. This process is crucial
    for maintaining consistency between the creature's in-game behavior and its database
    definition.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the creature template to initialize.
      This corresponds to the 'entry' field in the creature_template table.
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to the CreatureData structure containing runtime-specific
      data for this creature instance, such as spawn position, orientation, and respawn
      timers.
  returns: True if the creature was successfully initialized with the provided entry
    and data; false if initialization failed due to invalid parameters or missing
    template data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Initialization
    code: "Creature* creature = new Creature();\nuint32 entryId = 12345;\nCreatureData\
      \ const* data = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureData(entryId);\nif (creature->InitEntry(entryId,\
      \ data)) {\n    // Creature initialized successfully\n    creature->SetRespawnTime(300);\
      \ // Set respawn time to 5 minutes\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n\
      \    delete creature;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Error Handling
    code: "Creature* creature = new Creature();\nuint32 entryId = 12345;\nCreatureData\
      \ const* data = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureData(entryId);\nif (!data) {\n    //\
      \ Handle missing creature data\n    delete creature;\n    return false;\n}\n\
      \nif (creature->InitEntry(entryId, data)) {\n    // Successfully initialized\
      \ - proceed with further setup\n    creature->LoadFromDB();\n    creature->SetVisible(true);\n\
      \    sMapMgr->AddCreatureToGrid(creature);\n} else {\n    // Log error and cleanup\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize creature with entry %u\", entryId);\n\
      \    delete creature;\n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core during creature creation
    or loading from database. It's important that the CreatureData pointer passed
    to this method is valid and not null. The method does not handle dynamic updates
    to creature properties after initialization; those should be handled separately
    through other methods like SetDisplayId() or SetFaction().
  warnings: Calling InitEntry on an already initialized creature may lead to undefined
    behavior or memory leaks. Always ensure that the CreatureData object pointed to
    remains valid for the lifetime of the Creature instance. Do not call this method
    directly unless you are certain about the initialization sequence and data validity.
