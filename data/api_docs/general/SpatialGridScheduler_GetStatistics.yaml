  class: SpatialGridScheduler
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: Statistics SpatialGridScheduler::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical information about the spatial grid scheduler's current
    state and performance metrics.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a Statistics object containing detailed
    performance and operational data from the SpatialGridScheduler. This includes
    information such as the number of cells currently active, total entities managed,
    average processing time per cell, and memory usage statistics. The returned data
    is useful for monitoring system performance, debugging spatial partitioning issues,
    and optimizing grid configurations in large-scale World of Warcraft instances.
    The method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state of the scheduler.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Statistics object containing key metrics about the spatial grid scheduler's
    operation including active cell count, entity counts, processing times, and memory
    usage statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'SpatialGridScheduler scheduler;

      // ... populate scheduler with data ...

      auto stats = scheduler.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Active cells: " << stats.activeCells << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Total entities: " << stats.totalEntities << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "void MonitorSchedulerPerformance(SpatialGridScheduler& scheduler) {\n \
      \   auto stats = scheduler.GetStatistics();\n    if (stats.avgProcessingTimeMs\
      \ > 10.0f) {\n        // Log warning about slow processing\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      SpatialGridScheduler: Average processing time %.2fms exceeds threshold\", stats.avgProcessingTimeMs);\n\
      \    }\n    // Log memory usage\n    sLog->outString(\"SpatialGridScheduler:\
      \ Memory usage %zu bytes\", stats.memoryUsageBytes);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Statistics object returned by this method is a snapshot of the current
    state and may not reflect real-time values if called concurrently with other operations.
    The memory usage statistic includes overhead from internal data structures but
    excludes the actual entity data stored in cells.
  warnings: This method should not be called excessively in performance-critical sections
    as it may involve locking mechanisms or expensive computations depending on implementation
    details. Avoid calling this method during high-frequency updates or in time-sensitive
    code paths.
