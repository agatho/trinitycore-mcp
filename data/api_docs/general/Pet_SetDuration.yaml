  method: SetDuration
  signature: void Pet::SetDuration(int32 dur)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the duration timer for the pet, determining how long it will remain
    active before despawning.
  description: The SetDuration method configures the time-to-live (TTL) for a pet
    entity within the TrinityCore framework. This duration controls how long the pet
    remains in the world before automatically despawning or becoming inactive. The
    method accepts an integer value representing milliseconds, which is typically
    used to set a countdown timer that governs the pet's existence. This functionality
    is commonly used for temporary pets such as summoned creatures, guardian pets,
    or any creature with a limited lifespan. The duration value is usually set during
    pet creation or when the pet's behavior changes, and it directly influences the
    pet's removal from the game world after the specified time has elapsed.
  parameters:
  - name: dur
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the pet should remain active.
      A value of zero or negative typically indicates no duration limit or immediate
      despawn.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a 30-second pet duration
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->SetDuration(30000);\
      \ // Set pet to last 30 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a permanent pet duration
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->SetDuration(0);\
      \ // No time limit, pet remains indefinitely\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal pet state and may affect the pet's AI behavior
    or removal logic. The duration is typically managed by the pet's owner (player)
    and can be reset multiple times during the pet's lifetime. It's important to note
    that setting a very short duration may cause pets to despawn immediately if the
    time passes before the next update cycle.
  warnings: Setting a negative duration value may result in undefined behavior or
    immediate pet removal. Always validate input values before calling this method,
    especially when dealing with user-provided durations. Be cautious when changing
    duration during active combat or critical pet behaviors as it might interrupt
    ongoing actions.
