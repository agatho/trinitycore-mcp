documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to leave a chat channel
  description: The HandleLeaveChannel method handles the packet sent by a client when
    a player wishes to leave a specific chat channel. It validates the channel name,
    checks if the player is currently a member of that channel, and removes the player
    from the channel's membership list. This method ensures proper cleanup of channel
    subscriptions and updates the client's channel state accordingly. The method operates
    within the WorldSession context, meaning it's tied to a specific player connection
    and handles only the channel removal logic without affecting other session data.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleLeaveChannel(WorldPackets::Channel::LeaveChannel&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Method implementation would validate channel name and remove\
      \ player from channel\n    // Example: if (IsPlayerInChannel(packet.ChannelName))\n\
      \    //          RemovePlayerFromChannel(packet.ChannelName);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore network
    handler when a client sends a leave channel packet. The implementation assumes
    that the packet has already been validated for basic structure and content. Developers
    should be aware that this method does not directly send confirmation packets back
    to the client; that responsibility usually falls to higher-level handlers or the
    packet processing system.
