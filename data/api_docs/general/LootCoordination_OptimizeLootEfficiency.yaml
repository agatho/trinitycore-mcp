  signature: void LootCoordination::OptimizeLootEfficiency(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes loot distribution efficiency for a group by adjusting loot rules
    and coordination settings.
  description: The OptimizeLootEfficiency method adjusts internal loot coordination
    parameters to improve the efficiency of loot distribution within a specified group.
    This method likely modifies how loot is handled during group looting scenarios,
    potentially prioritizing certain loot types or adjusting the order in which items
    are distributed to players. It may also influence the behavior of loot rolling
    systems and the allocation of loot among group members based on predefined rules
    or game mechanics. The method operates on a Group object and modifies the loot
    coordination state for that specific group.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Optimize loot efficiency for a group
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    LootCoordination::OptimizeLootEfficiency(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the TrinityCore loot system to dynamically
    adjust how loot is distributed in group scenarios. It may be called automatically
    during certain events or manually when specific loot coordination strategies are
    needed.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This
    method modifies internal loot coordination state, so calling it at inappropriate
    times might disrupt normal loot distribution flow.
