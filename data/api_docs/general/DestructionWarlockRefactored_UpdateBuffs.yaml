documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buffs and debuffs for the destruction warlock.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing the
    state of all active buffs and debuffs that are currently affecting the destruction
    warlock character. This method typically iterates through the player's aura application
    list, evaluates their duration and effects, and applies or removes them as necessary.
    It ensures that the warlock's combat abilities remain properly enhanced or impaired
    based on the current game state. The method is commonly called during combat updates
    or when new auras are applied to maintain accurate buff/debuff tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    destructionWarlock.UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... continue with combat processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Warlock AI
    code: "class MyWarlockAI : public DestructionWarlockRefactored\n{\npublic:\n \
      \   void OnTick()\n    {\n        // Perform custom logic\n        UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \        // Apply additional warlock-specific behavior\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called frequently during combat, so performance optimization
    is important. It relies on the underlying aura system and should not be invoked
    outside of appropriate game update contexts to prevent unintended side effects.
  warnings: Calling UpdateBuffs manually outside of normal game loop updates can cause
    inconsistent buff states or unexpected behavior. Ensure that this method is only
    called during valid game state transitions where aura modifications are expected.
