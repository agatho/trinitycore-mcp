documentation:
  brief: Moves a SmartAIMgr object to another SmartAIMgr instance, transferring ownership
    of its resources.
  description: This is the move constructor for the SmartAIMgr class. It transfers
    all managed resources from the source SmartAIMgr object (passed as an rvalue reference)
    to the current object. After the move operation, the source object will be left
    in a valid but unspecified state. This method is part of the C++ standard library's
    move semantics and is used to efficiently transfer ownership of dynamically allocated
    memory or other resources without copying them. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this constructor allows for efficient management of smart AI behavior
    data structures when creating new instances or reassigning existing ones.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another SmartAIMgr object whose resources
      will be moved to the current instance.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Move construction of SmartAIMgr
    code: 'SmartAIMgr manager1;

      // ... initialize manager1 ...

      SmartAIMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using move in a function returning SmartAIMgr
    code: "SmartAIMgr createManager() {\n    SmartAIMgr mgr;\n    // ... initialize\
      \ manager ...\n    return mgr; // Return by value, triggers move constructor\n\
      }\n\nSmartAIMgr newManager = createManager();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard move constructor implementation. It's important to understand
    that after calling this constructor, the source object should not be used unless
    it's explicitly reset or reassigned. The move operation typically involves transferring
    pointers or handles rather than copying data, making it much more efficient than
    copy operations for large objects.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that any code using the source SmartAIMgr instance is not executed
    after this constructor call. Also, be aware that this constructor is typically
    invoked implicitly during certain operations like returning objects from functions
    or assigning rvalue expressions.
