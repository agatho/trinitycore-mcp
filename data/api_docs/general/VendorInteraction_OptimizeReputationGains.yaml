documentation:
  brief: Optimizes reputation gains for the player during vendor interactions.
  description: The OptimizeReputationGains method adjusts the reputation rewards a
    player receives when completing vendor transactions. This optimization ensures
    that players receive maximum possible reputation benefits from their purchases,
    taking into account factors such as faction standing, reputation caps, and any
    applicable modifiers. The method is typically invoked during vendor interaction
    events to dynamically adjust the reputation gain values based on the current game
    state and player's relationship with the vendor's faction.
