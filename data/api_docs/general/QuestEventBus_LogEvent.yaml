  class: QuestEventBus
  method: LogEvent
  signature: void QuestEventBus::LogEvent(const QuestEvent & event, const std::string
    & action) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a quest event with associated action information to the event bus.
  description: The LogEvent method records a specified quest event along with an associated
    action string into the quest event bus system. This functionality is typically
    used for tracking quest-related activities, debugging, or monitoring player progress
    within the game world. The method does not return any value and operates as a
    void function. It is designed to be called during quest progression, completion,
    or failure events to maintain a log of player interactions with quests. The event
    bus system may use this logging for internal processing, data analysis, or integration
    with external systems such as quest tracking or achievement systems.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The QuestEvent object representing the specific event that occurred
      during quest progression. This includes details about the quest, player, and
      event type.
  - name: action
    description: A string describing the action associated with the quest event. This
      could represent a player's interaction such as 'accepted', 'completed', or 'failed'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Event Logging
    code: 'QuestEvent event;

      event.questId = 12345;

      event.playerGuid = 67890;

      QuestEventBus::LogEvent(event, "accepted");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Quest Completion Event
    code: 'QuestEvent event;

      event.questId = 54321;

      event.playerGuid = 98765;

      QuestEventBus::LogEvent(event, "completed");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger event-driven architecture within TrinityCore.
    It's important to note that logging events may have performance implications if
    called excessively during high-frequency quest interactions. The implementation
    might utilize thread-safe mechanisms for concurrent access.
  warnings: Ensure that the QuestEvent object passed in contains valid data, particularly
    the questId and playerGuid fields, as invalid values could lead to incorrect event
    tracking or system errors. Avoid calling this method in performance-critical code
    paths without considering its impact on system responsiveness.
