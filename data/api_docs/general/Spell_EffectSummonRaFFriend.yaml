  brief: Summon a random friendly target for the spell.
  description: This method summons a random friendly creature or player target for
    the spell. It is typically used in conjunction with spell effects that require
    a target selection, such as summoning a random friendly unit to assist the caster.
    The method selects a target from the available friendly units within the spell's
    range and performs the summoning operation. This functionality is commonly found
    in spells like 'Summon Random Friend' or similar mechanics where the target selection
    is randomized.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectSummonRaFFriend();'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely uses the spell''s target selection
    logic to randomly choose a friendly target from available units. Performance considerations:
    The method may involve random number generation and target selection logic, which
    could impact performance in high-frequency usage scenarios. Thread safety: This
    method is generally not thread-safe and should be used with caution in multi-threaded
    environments.'
  warnings: This method may cause unexpected behavior if the spell's target selection
    logic is not properly configured or if there are no friendly targets available
    within range. Common mistakes include using this method without ensuring that
    the spell has valid friendly targets to summon.
