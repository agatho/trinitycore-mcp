documentation:
  brief: Sets the negative modifier for ranged attack power on the unit.
  description: This method modifies the ranged attack power of a Unit by applying
    a negative adjustment value. It affects the unit's ability to perform ranged attacks,
    typically used in scenarios where the unit needs to have its ranged attack power
    reduced or modified for gameplay purposes such as buffing, debuffing, or special
    effects. The modification is applied directly to the unit's ranged attack power
    calculation and may influence accuracy and damage output in combat.
  parameters:
  - name: attackPowerMod
    description: The negative modifier value to be applied to the ranged attack power.
      This value can be positive or negative, with negative values reducing the attack
      power.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetRangedAttackPowerModNeg(-100);

      // This reduces the ranged attack power by 100'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other attack power modification
    methods and may interact with various combat mechanics such as accuracy, critical
    hit chance, or damage calculations. The effect of this modifier is usually applied
    immediately upon invocation.
  warnings: Improper use of negative modifiers can lead to unexpected behavior in
    combat, particularly when dealing with units that have specific attack power requirements
    for certain abilities or effects. Care should be taken when applying negative
    modifiers to avoid unintended consequences.
