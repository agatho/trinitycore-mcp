  class: BotScheduler
  method: CreateCasualPattern
  signature: ActivityPattern BotScheduler::CreateCasualPattern() const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a casual activity pattern for bot scheduling.
  description: The CreateCasualPattern method generates an ActivityPattern object
    that defines a casual, non-rigid schedule for bot activities. This pattern typically
    includes flexible timing, varied task distribution, and adaptive behavior that
    mimics natural player engagement. The returned pattern is designed to provide
    a balanced workload distribution across different bot types while maintaining
    realistic activity flow. The method does not modify any internal state and is
    intended to be used as part of the bot scheduler's configuration process.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ActivityPattern object representing a casual scheduling pattern with
    flexible timing and varied task execution intervals.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ActivityPattern casualPattern = scheduler.CreateCasualPattern();

      // Use the pattern to configure bot behavior

      bot.SetActivityPattern(casualPattern);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or when switching
    between different scheduling modes. The returned pattern may be further customized
    by the caller before being applied to specific bots.
