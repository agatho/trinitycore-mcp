documentation:
  brief: Updates player's reputation with a faction when reputation changes occur.
  description: The ReputationChanged method handles the updating of a player's reputation
    status with a specific faction when reputation changes take place. This method
    is typically invoked internally by the game engine when a player gains or loses
    reputation points with a particular faction, and it ensures that the player's
    reputation state is properly updated in the game world. It plays a crucial role
    in the dynamic reputation system of World of Warcraft, allowing players to progress
    through various factions and their associated reputation levels.
  parameters:
  - name: factionEntry
    description: Pointer to the FactionEntry structure that defines the faction being
      updated. This represents the specific faction whose reputation is changing.
  - name: change
    description: Integer value indicating the amount of reputation change. This can
      be positive or negative, representing gain or loss of reputation points.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Change Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player;

      FactionEntry* faction = GetFactionEntry(123);

      int32 change = 100;

      player->ReputationChanged(faction, change);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal reputation system handling and should
    not be called directly by external code unless specifically required. It typically
    involves updating the player's reputation state within the game world and may
    trigger related events such as quest updates or faction level changes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect reputation states, potentially
    affecting quest progression or faction relationships. Ensure that the faction
    entry is valid and the change value is appropriate for the current reputation
    system.
