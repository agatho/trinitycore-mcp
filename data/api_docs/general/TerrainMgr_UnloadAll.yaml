documentation:
  brief: Unloads all terrain data from memory
  description: The UnloadAll method removes all loaded terrain data from the game's
    memory, freeing up resources and clearing the terrain manager's internal cache.
    This operation is typically invoked during map transitions, server shutdowns,
    or when cleaning up unused terrain assets. The method ensures that no terrain-related
    data remains in memory, which can help prevent memory leaks and reduce overall
    server memory usage. It is important to note that this operation will invalidate
    any existing terrain references and should only be called when it's safe to do
    so.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: TerrainMgr::instance()->UnloadAll();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server during map loading/unloading
    cycles. It's recommended to avoid calling this method during active gameplay as
    it may cause terrain-related issues or visual glitches.
  warnings: Calling UnloadAll while players are actively in terrain areas may result
    in undefined behavior, including client-side crashes or visual artifacts. Always
    ensure no players are in the affected terrain zones before invoking this method.
