  class: ObjectGuid
  method: GetRealmId
  signature: uint32 ObjectGuid::GetRealmId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the realm ID portion from an ObjectGuid.
  description: The GetRealmId method extracts and returns the realm identifier component
    from a TrinityCore ObjectGuid. In World of Warcraft's architecture, ObjectGuid
    is used to uniquely identify game objects across realms and instances. The realm
    ID represents the unique identifier for the specific realm or server instance
    where the object resides. This value is typically used in cross-realm communications,
    database lookups, and ensuring proper object identification in distributed systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the realm ID portion of the ObjectGuid.
    This value identifies the specific realm or server instance within the TrinityCore
    network architecture.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(123456);

      uint32 realmId = guid.GetRealmId();

      // realmId will contain the realm identifier portion of the GUID'
    language: cpp
  - title: Realm ID Validation
    code: "ObjectGuid playerGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(123456);\n\
      uint32 realmId = playerGuid.GetRealmId();\nif (realmId != 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ cross-realm operations\n    std::cout << \"Realm ID: \" << realmId << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on the internal bit layout of ObjectGuid, which is structured
    to contain multiple components including realm ID, counter, and type information.
    This implementation assumes proper initialization of the ObjectGuid structure
    with valid realm ID values.
