  method: GetData
  signature: uint32 SmartAI::GetData(uint32 id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves stored data value associated with the specified ID from SmartAI's
    internal data storage.
  description: The GetData method retrieves a 32-bit unsigned integer value that was
    previously stored using the SetData method within the SmartAI instance. This functionality
    allows for persistent state tracking across different AI events and actions. The
    retrieved value is typically used to maintain context or flags during creature
    behavior execution, such as tracking quest progress, activation states, or custom
    AI variables. The method operates on an internal data map indexed by a uint32
    identifier, making it suitable for storing and retrieving small amounts of integer-based
    state information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the 32-bit unsigned integer value associated with the specified
    ID. If no value has been set for the given ID, the method returns 0 by default,
    indicating an uninitialized or unset data state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve AI State
    code: "uint32 questState = creature->GetAI()->GetData(12345);\nif (questState\
      \ == 1)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetData for Conditional Behavior
    code: "SmartAI* ai = creature->GetAI();\nuint32 currentPhase = ai->GetData(500);\n\
      switch (currentPhase)\n{\n    case 0:\n        // Initial phase\n        break;\n\
      \    case 1:\n        // Combat phase\n        break;\n    default:\n      \
      \  // Default behavior\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI framework which provides enhanced AI capabilities
    for creatures in TrinityCore. The data storage mechanism is local to each creature's
    AI instance and does not persist between server restarts unless explicitly saved
    to database fields. It's recommended to use meaningful ID values to avoid conflicts
    with other AI components or scripts.
  warnings: Ensure that the ID parameter corresponds to a valid data key previously
    set using SetData, otherwise the returned value will be zero. This can lead to
    unexpected behavior if not properly managed in conditional logic.
