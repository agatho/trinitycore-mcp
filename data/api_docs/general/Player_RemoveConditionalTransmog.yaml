documentation:
  brief: Removes a conditional transmogrification item from the player's inventory.
  description: This method removes a specific conditional transmogrification item
    identified by its itemModifiedAppearanceId from the player's inventory. It is
    used to clear transmog items that have been applied conditionally, typically in
    response to game mechanics or quest conditions. The method ensures that the transmog
    item is properly removed from the player's collection and may affect the visual
    appearance of the equipped item.
  parameters:
  - name: itemModifiedAppearanceId
    description: The unique identifier for the modified appearance item that represents
      the transmogrification. This value corresponds to a specific item appearance
      in the game database and is used to identify which conditional transmog should
      be removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 transmogId = 12345;

      player->RemoveConditionalTransmog(transmogId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other transmog-related methods
    to manage player's appearance. It may involve checking if the item exists in the
    player's inventory before removal, and should be used carefully to avoid unintended
    visual changes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect visual appearance or
    missing transmog items from the player's collection. Care must be taken when removing
    conditional transmogs to ensure that the correct itemModifiedAppearanceId is used.
