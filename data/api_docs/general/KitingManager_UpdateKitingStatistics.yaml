documentation:
  brief: Updates internal kiting statistics for player movement and combat efficiency
    analysis.
  description: The UpdateKitingStatistics method is responsible for maintaining and
    updating various performance metrics related to a player's kiting behavior within
    the TrinityCore framework. Kiting refers to the technique of moving while attacking,
    commonly used in World of Warcraft to maintain distance from enemies while dealing
    damage. This method likely tracks data such as movement speed during combat, successful
    kiting attempts, time spent kiting, and other relevant metrics that contribute
    to player performance analysis. The statistics gathered by this method are typically
    used for gameplay balance, achievement tracking, or performance optimization purposes
    within the game engine.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void Player::UpdateCombatStats()\n{\n    // ... combat logic ...\n    kitingManager.UpdateKitingStatistics();\n\
      \    // ... continue combat logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically during active combat or movement
    states. It may be optimized to avoid performance overhead by only updating statistics
    when significant movement or combat events occur. The implementation might utilize
    internal timers or event triggers rather than being called on every game tick.
  warnings: Developers should ensure this method is not called excessively in tight
    loops as it could introduce performance bottlenecks. The method may depend on
    valid player state data, so calling it when the player is not in combat or moving
    might yield inaccurate statistics.
