documentation:
  brief: Determines whether it is safe to spawn a resource at the current location
    based on environmental and game state conditions.
  description: The IsSpawningSafe method evaluates various factors to determine if
    spawning a resource (such as a mine, herb, or treasure) at the current location
    would be valid within the context of World of Warcraft's gameplay mechanics. This
    includes checking for conflicting spawns, terrain suitability, proximity to other
    resources, and server-defined limits. The method is typically used by the game
    engine before attempting to place a new resource in the world to ensure that the
    spawn does not violate game rules or cause unintended behavior. It returns true
    if all safety checks pass, indicating that spawning is allowed; otherwise, it
    returns false.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if it is safe to spawn a resource at the current location
    according to game logic and environmental constraints; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in resource spawning logic
    code: "if (resourceMetrics.IsSpawningSafe()) {\n    // Proceed with spawning the\
      \ resource\n    SpawnResource();\n} else {\n    // Log or handle unsafe spawn\
      \ attempt\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Attempted to spawn resource at unsafe\
      \ location\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks such as verifying that no other resources
    of the same type exist within a defined radius, ensuring the terrain supports
    the resource type, and confirming that server limits for concurrent spawns have
    not been exceeded. It is part of the internal resource management system and may
    be called frequently during world initialization or dynamic resource generation.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method alone for security purposes; additional validation
    should be performed in game logic to prevent exploits. The safety checks may change
    with different server configurations or patches, so always verify behavior in
    your specific environment.
