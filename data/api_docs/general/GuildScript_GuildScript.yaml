  class: GuildScript
  method: GuildScript
  signature: void GuildScript::GuildScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GuildScript instance with the specified name.
  description: The GuildScript constructor initializes a new guild script instance
    with the provided name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework
    to register and manage custom guild-related scripts. The name parameter serves
    as an identifier for the script, allowing the game server to distinguish between
    different guild script implementations. When called, this constructor sets up
    the internal state of the GuildScript object, preparing it for use in guild events
    and hooks. This is a foundational method that must be properly invoked before
    the script can be utilized by the TrinityCore core system.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated character string that serves as the unique identifier
      for this GuildScript instance. This name is used internally by TrinityCore to
      register and retrieve the script during guild-related events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GuildScript Initialization
    code: "class MyGuildScript : public GuildScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyGuildScript()\
      \ : GuildScript(\"MyCustomGuildScript\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Custom Guild Script
    code: "void AddSC_my_guild_script()\n{\n    new MyGuildScript();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when loading scripts. Developers should ensure that each GuildScript instance
    has a unique name to prevent conflicts. The constructor does not perform any validation
    on the input name, so it's recommended to use descriptive and unique names for
    clarity.
  warnings: Improper initialization of GuildScript instances can lead to runtime errors
    or unexpected behavior in guild-related events. Ensure that all GuildScript constructors
    are properly called with valid string parameters. Avoid using empty strings or
    null pointers as the name parameter.
