documentation:
  brief: Resets the insanity tracker state to its initial condition.
  description: The Reset method clears all accumulated insanity values and resets
    the tracker to its default state. This method is typically invoked when a player's
    insanity status needs to be cleared, such as after completing a specific quest
    or when entering a new zone. The method ensures that any previous insanity tracking
    data is discarded and prepares the tracker for new calculations or measurements.
    It does not require any parameters and performs no return operations.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'InsanityTracker tracker;

      tracker.Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the insanity state is no longer relevant
    or when a new tracking cycle begins. It is recommended to verify the current state
    before resetting to prevent unintended side effects in gameplay mechanics.
