  method: SetCriteriaProgress
  signature: void CriteriaHandler::SetCriteriaProgress(const Criteria * criteria,
    uint64 changeValue, Player * referencePlayer, ProgressType progressType)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the progress of a criteria for a player based on a change value and
    progress type.
  description: The SetCriteriaProgress method is used to modify the progress of a
    specific criteria associated with a player in World of Warcraft. This function
    is typically invoked when a player performs an action that contributes to meeting
    the conditions of a criteria, such as killing a certain number of enemies or collecting
    items. The method takes into account the change value and the type of progress
    being applied (e.g., incrementing, resetting, or setting a specific value). It
    ensures that the criteria tracking system accurately reflects the player's advancement
    toward completing objectives. This method is part of the broader criteria handling
    system in TrinityCore, which supports achievements, quests, and other game mechanics
    requiring progress tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: criteria
    description: A pointer to the Criteria object that defines the conditions to be
      tracked. This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid criteria
      definition.
  - name: changeValue
    description: The numerical value by which the criteria progress should be adjusted.
      This can represent counts, amounts, or other measurable metrics depending on
      the criteria type.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: A pointer to the Player object for whom the criteria progress is
      being updated. This player must be valid and currently logged in for the changes
      to take effect.
  - name: progressType
    description: An enum value indicating how the changeValue should be applied to
      the criteria progress (e.g., increment, set, reset). The exact values depend
      on the ProgressType enumeration defined in the codebase.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Incrementing Criteria Progress
    code: 'Criteria* myCriteria = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(12345);

      Player* player = session->GetPlayer();

      SetCriteriaProgress(myCriteria, 1, player, ProgressType::INCREMENT);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Specific Criteria Progress
    code: 'Criteria* questCriteria = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(67890);

      Player* player = session->GetPlayer();

      SetCriteriaProgress(questCriteria, 100, player, ProgressType::SET);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe in the context of player sessions
    and should not be called from multiple threads simultaneously for the same player.
    The criteria must already be initialized and registered within the system before
    calling this function.
  warnings: Ensure that the criteria pointer passed is valid and corresponds to an
    existing criteria definition. Passing a null or invalid pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Also, be cautious when using ProgressType::SET as it directly
    overwrites the progress value without considering previous state.
