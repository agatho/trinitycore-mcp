  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float DeathKnightAI::GetOptimalRange(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for a Death Knight AI unit
    based on its current abilities and target.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    Death Knight AI should engage its target for maximum effectiveness. This calculation
    takes into account the Death Knight's specific abilities, such as whether it has
    access to melee attacks, ranged spells, or special abilities like Death Grip or
    Plague Strike. The returned float value represents the distance in yards where
    the AI should position itself to optimize damage output and ability usage while
    maintaining safety from enemy retaliation. This method is crucial for AI behavior
    that requires strategic positioning during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal attack range in yards. This value
    indicates the distance at which the Death Knight AI should position itself relative
    to its target for maximum tactical effectiveness. The value will typically be
    a positive number, with common ranges falling between 0 and 30 yards depending
    on the specific abilities and situation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target =\
      \ SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n    {\n        float optimalRange =\
      \ GetOptimalRange(target);\n        // Use optimalRange to determine movement\
      \ or spell casting\n        if (me->GetDistance(target) > optimalRange)\n  \
      \          DoMoveTo(target, optimalRange);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely considers the Death Knight's current weapon type, active
    spells, and ability cooldowns when calculating the optimal range. It may also
    factor in environmental constraints or target characteristics such as mobility.
    The exact implementation details are not visible from the method signature alone
    but would be typical of AI pathfinding and combat decision-making logic.
  warnings: The returned range value should not be used directly for movement without
    considering other factors like terrain, obstacles, or enemy positioning. Additionally,
    this value is static at the time of calculation and may become outdated if the
    target's position or abilities change significantly during combat.
