documentation:
  brief: Executes a pending spell action queued for the AI-controlled creature.
  description: The ExecutePendingSpell method processes and executes a spell that
    has been queued for execution by the ClassAI instance. This method is typically
    called during the AI's update cycle to handle delayed or scheduled spell casting
    operations. It ensures that spells are cast according to their intended timing
    and conditions, maintaining proper game flow and AI behavior consistency. The
    method checks if there is a valid pending spell and executes it immediately if
    conditions are met.

  - title: Basic Spell Execution
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n  \
      \  ExecutePendingSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the AI update loop to ensure
    proper timing and execution context. It is designed to be non-blocking and will
    not cause delays in the main game loop.
