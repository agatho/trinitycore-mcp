  class: Unit
  method: SetUninteractible
  signature: void Unit::SetUninteractible(bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a unit to be uninteractible, preventing player interaction with the
    unit.
  description: The SetUninteractible method controls whether a unit can be interacted
    with by players. When applied, it prevents players from interacting with the unit
    through various means such as dialog, quest acceptance, or other interaction mechanics.
    This method is commonly used to control NPC behavior during certain events or
    phases, ensuring that players cannot interact with specific units until the appropriate
    conditions are met. The method affects the unit's ability to respond to player
    interactions and can be toggled on or off based on game requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to apply or remove the uninteractible
      state. True applies the uninteractible state, False removes it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetUninteractible(true);

      // Unit is now uninteractible

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetUninteractible(false);

      // Unit is now interactible again

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely modifies internal flags or states
    within the unit''s object to prevent interaction. Performance considerations:
    The operation itself is lightweight, but frequent toggling may impact performance
    if used excessively in loops or event handlers. Thread safety: This method should
    be thread-safe as long as it operates on a single unit object at a time.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using this method without understanding its implications
    can lead to players being unable to interact with NPCs during important events.
    Dangerous edge cases: If applied incorrectly, it may prevent interaction with
    all players or cause unexpected behavior in NPC interactions during quest progression
    or event handling.'
