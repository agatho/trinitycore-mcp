  class: BotWorldEntry
  method: RecordStateTransition
  signature: void BotWorldEntry::RecordStateTransition(BotWorldEntryState oldState,
    BotWorldEntryState newState)
documentation:
  brief: Records a state transition for a bot world entry from an old state to a new
    state.
  description: 'The RecordStateTransition method logs or stores the transition of
    a bot world entry from one state to another. This functionality is typically used
    in the context of managing bot behavior and tracking their lifecycle within the
    game world. The method likely updates internal state tracking mechanisms, may
    trigger associated events, or persist state changes for future reference. It serves
    as part of the broader state management system for bot entities in TrinityCore''s
    AI framework. Precondition: Both oldState and newState must be valid BotWorldEntryState
    enum values. Postcondition: The transition is recorded, potentially affecting
    internal state tracking or triggering downstream processes.'
  parameters:
  - name: oldState
    description: The previous state of the bot world entry before the transition occurs.
      Must be a valid value from the BotWorldEntryState enumeration.
  - name: newState
    description: The new state that the bot world entry is transitioning to. Must
      be a valid value from the BotWorldEntryState enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Transition Recording
    code: 'BotWorldEntry entry;

      entry.RecordStateTransition(BotWorldEntryState::IDLE, BotWorldEntryState::MOVING);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Complex State Change
    code: "BotWorldEntry* bot = GetBotById(12345);\nif (bot)\n{\n    bot->RecordStateTransition(bot->GetState(),\
      \ BotWorldEntryState::FIGHTING);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger state machine implementation for bots.
    It may be used internally by the AI system to maintain consistency in bot behavior
    tracking and to ensure proper handling of transitions between different operational
    modes such as idle, moving, fighting, etc.
