  signature: void InstanceCoordination::HandleGroupDecisionMaking(Group * group, const
    std::string & decision)
documentation:
  brief: Processes group decision-making for instance coordination in TrinityCore.
  description: The HandleGroupDecisionMaking method manages the logic for how a group
    makes decisions within an instance coordination context. This typically involves
    handling group member responses to instance-related choices, such as whether to
    proceed with a dungeon encounter or accept a raid challenge. The method evaluates
    the provided decision string and applies appropriate group-wide actions based
    on the current instance state and group composition. It ensures that all group
    members are synchronized in their decision-making process, maintaining consistency
    across the instance.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group making the decision.
      Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: decision
    description: String representing the decision made by the group. Common values
      may include 'accept', 'decline', or specific instance-related commands.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Decision Handling
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->HandleGroupDecisionMaking(myGroup,\
      \ \"accept\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during instance entry or encounter initiation
    phases. It assumes that the group has already been validated and is active within
    an instance context. The decision string should be properly formatted to match
    expected values in the instance coordination system.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior. The decision string must
    match expected formats or the method may not process the decision correctly.
