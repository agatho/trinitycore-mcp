  signature: bool WaypointMovementGenerator::IsLoadedFromDB() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the waypoint movement generator has been loaded from the
    database.
  description: The IsLoadedFromDB method checks if the WaypointMovementGenerator instance
    was initialized with waypoints retrieved from the database. This flag is typically
    set during object construction or initialization when waypoint data is fetched
    from the world database. It helps distinguish between generators that were created
    with predefined waypoints versus those that may be dynamically generated or empty.
    The method returns true if the waypoints were loaded from the database, and false
    otherwise. This information is crucial for AI behavior logic and debugging purposes,
    particularly in scenarios where different movement patterns are applied based
    on how waypoints were obtained.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the waypoint movement generator was initialized with data
    loaded from the database; returns false if the waypoints were not loaded from
    the database or if the generator is in an uninitialized state.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Waypoint Movement Generator is Database Loaded
    code: "WaypointMovementGenerator* wpGen = new WaypointMovementGenerator();\nif\
      \ (wpGen->IsLoadedFromDB()) {\n    // Handle case where waypoints were loaded\
      \ from DB\n    sLog->outString(\"Waypoints loaded from database.\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where waypoints were not loaded from DB\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Waypoints not loaded from database.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore AI system to
    determine the source of waypoint data. Developers should be aware that this flag
    may affect how movement behavior is handled, especially in cases where different
    logic paths are taken depending on whether waypoints were loaded from database
    or generated dynamically.
