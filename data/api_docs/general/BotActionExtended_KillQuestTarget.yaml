  class: BotActionExtended
  method: KillQuestTarget
  signature: BotActionExtended BotActionExtended::KillQuestTarget(int bot, int target,
    uint32 questId, uint32 objectiveIndex, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a bot to kill a quest target for a specified quest objective.
  description: The KillQuestTarget method is used in TrinityCore's bot system to instruct
    a specific bot to engage and eliminate a designated quest target. This action
    is typically part of a larger quest completion sequence where the bot must interact
    with NPCs or creatures related to a given quest objective. The method requires
    specifying the bot ID, target ID, quest identifier, and the index of the objective
    within that quest. It returns a BotActionExtended object which can be used to
    chain further actions or check the status of the operation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the bot that will perform the action.
      Must correspond to an active bot instance in the system.
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the creature or NPC target that the
      bot should kill. This must be a valid entity within the game world.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest for which this target is
      required. Used to track progress and ensure proper quest completion.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index position of the specific objective within the quest that
      corresponds to this target. Zero-based indexing is expected.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A Unix timestamp indicating when the action was initiated. Used for
      logging, timing, and ensuring proper sequence execution.
  returns: Returns a BotActionExtended object representing the queued or executed
    action. This can be used to monitor the progress of the bot's task or chain additional
    actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: BotActionExtended action = botManager.KillQuestTarget(12345, 67890, 1234,
      0, time(nullptr));
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining with another action
    code: 'BotActionExtended first = botManager.KillQuestTarget(12345, 67890, 1234,
      0, time(nullptr));

      BotActionExtended second = first.MoveTo(12345, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore bot AI system and assumes that both
    the bot and target entities exist in the game world. The quest ID and objective
    index must correctly map to an existing quest objective for proper tracking.
  warnings: Ensure that the target entity exists and is valid before calling this
    method, otherwise it may result in undefined behavior or failed actions. Also,
    be cautious about using timestamps that are too far in the past or future as they
    might affect action timing logic.
