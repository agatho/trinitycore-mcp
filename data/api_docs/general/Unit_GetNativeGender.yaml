documentation:
  brief: Returns the native gender of the unit, which determines the gender-specific
    animations and voice.
  description: 'The GetNativeGender method retrieves the native gender of a Unit object,
    which is used to determine the gender-specific behavior and animations for the
    unit. This value is typically set during the creation of the unit and affects
    how the unit''s model and voice are displayed in the game world. The method returns
    an integer representing one of three possible genders: 0 for male, 1 for female,
    or 2 for neuter. This information is crucial for determining the correct gender-specific
    animations and sounds for NPCs and players.'
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the native gender of the unit. The
    value can be 0 (male), 1 (female), or 2 (neuter). This corresponds to the gender
    enum values used in the game's internal data structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int gender = unit->GetNativeGender();\nif (gender == 0)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ male unit\n}\nelse if (gender == 1)\n{\n    // Handle female unit\n}\nelse\
      \ if (gender == 2)\n{\n    // Handle neuter unit\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during unit initialization and should not be
    modified during runtime. The native gender value is set at creation time and reflects
    the unit's original gender as defined in the database or script.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method, as changing the native gender
    after a unit has been initialized can lead to unexpected behavior in animations
    and voice. Also, this method should not be used for determining the current gender
    of a unit during gameplay, as that may differ from the native gender.
