  class: EnhancedBotAIFactory
  method: CreateEnhancedAI
  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateEnhancedAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes an enhanced AI for a specified bot player.
  description: The CreateEnhancedAI method is responsible for setting up and configuring
    an advanced artificial intelligence system for a given bot player within the TrinityCore
    framework. This function typically handles the allocation of AI resources, initialization
    of behavior patterns, and integration with the game's existing AI subsystems.
    The method ensures that the bot player is properly equipped with enhanced decision-making
    capabilities that go beyond standard AI behavior. It may also perform validation
    checks to ensure the bot is in a valid state before AI initialization begins.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while negative
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid input, resource
    allocation failures, or system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Creation for a Bot
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is properly initialized\nint result =\
      \ factory->CreateEnhancedAI(bot);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully\
      \ created\n    printf(\"Enhanced AI created successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to create enhanced AI, error code:\
      \ %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or when transitioning
    a player character into bot mode. The implementation may involve memory allocation
    for AI structures and setup of behavior trees or state machines. Developers should
    ensure that the Player object passed to this function is valid and properly initialized
    before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized Player pointer will
    likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate the input player
    object before invoking CreateEnhancedAI. Additionally, multiple calls to this
    method on the same bot without proper cleanup may lead to resource leaks or inconsistent
    AI states.
