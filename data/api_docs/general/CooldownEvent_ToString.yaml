  brief: Converts a CooldownEvent object into a human-readable string representation
  description: The ToString method provides a textual representation of a CooldownEvent
    instance, typically used for debugging, logging, or displaying cooldown information
    in a readable format. This method is commonly utilized within the TrinityCore
    framework to serialize cooldown data for various game systems including spell
    cooldowns, item cooldowns, and ability timers. The returned string usually contains
    key identifying information about the cooldown event such as its type, associated
    spell or item ID, remaining time, and other relevant metadata. This method does
    not modify the internal state of the CooldownEvent object and is safe to call
    multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the CooldownEvent
    object that includes identifying information such as spell/item ID, cooldown duration,
    remaining time, and other relevant attributes. The exact format may vary based
    on implementation but typically follows a structured pattern for easy parsing
    or display.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: 'CooldownEvent* event = new CooldownEvent();

      // ... populate event with cooldown data ...

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("cooldown", "Cooldown Event: {}", event->ToString());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Displaying Cooldown Information in Game UI
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nCooldownEvent* cooldown = player->GetSpellCooldown(12345);\n\
      if (cooldown)\n{\n    std::string cooldownInfo = cooldown->ToString();\n   \
      \ // Display cooldownInfo in game interface\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and logging purposes. The
    exact format of the returned string may change between TrinityCore versions. The
    implementation should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded contexts. Consider
    performance implications when calling this method frequently in high-frequency
    loops.
  warnings: Do not rely on the specific format of the returned string for programmatic
    parsing as it may change. The method returns a copy of the formatted string, so
    any modifications to the return value won't affect the original object. In performance-critical
    code paths, consider caching the result if the same information is needed multiple
    times.
