  class: DungeonScriptMgr
  method: GetScriptCount
  signature: uint32 DungeonScriptMgr::GetScriptCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of dungeon scripts registered within the DungeonScriptMgr
    instance.
  description: The GetScriptCount method returns the number of dungeon scripts currently
    loaded and managed by the DungeonScriptMgr. This count represents all script instances
    associated with dungeon-related events, such as boss encounters, instance creation,
    or other scripted behaviors within the TrinityCore framework. The method is typically
    used for debugging purposes, internal bookkeeping, or to determine how many scripts
    are active in a given dungeon environment. It does not perform any operations
    on the scripts themselves but simply provides a numerical count of their presence.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of dungeon scripts currently
    registered with the DungeonScriptMgr. This number indicates how many script entries
    are available for execution or management within the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Script Count
    code: 'uint32 count = sDungeonScriptMgr->GetScriptCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Active dungeon scripts: %u", count);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a read-only operation and does not modify any internal state.
    It should be safe to call from multiple threads if the underlying manager is thread-safe,
    though typically this would be used in a single-threaded context during initialization
    or logging.
