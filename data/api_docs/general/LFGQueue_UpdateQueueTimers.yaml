  method: UpdateQueueTimers
  signature: void LFGQueue::UpdateQueueTimers(uint8 queueId, time_t currTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the timers for a specific queue in the LFG system
  description: The UpdateQueueTimers method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal timers associated with a particular queue ID within the Looking For
    Group (LFG) subsystem. This method ensures that queue-related time-based operations,
    such as cooldowns, waiting periods, or timeout mechanisms, are properly maintained
    and synchronized with the current game time. It is typically invoked by the LFG
    system's main loop or timer handlers to keep queue states accurate and consistent.
    The method operates on a per-queue basis, allowing for independent timer management
    across different LFG queues (e.g., for different dungeons or group types).
  parameters:
  - name: queueId
    description: The unique identifier of the LFG queue to update timers for. This
      value corresponds to a specific queue type within the LFG system, such as for
      specific dungeon groups or raid instances.
  - name: currTime
    description: The current Unix timestamp that serves as the reference point for
      updating queue timers. This is used to determine elapsed time and manage timeouts
      or cooldowns.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in LFG system update loop
    code: "void LFGUpdateLoop()\n{\n    time_t currentTime = time(nullptr);\n    for\
      \ (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_LFG_QUEUES; ++i)\n    {\n        sLFGQueue->UpdateQueueTimers(i,\
      \ currentTime);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently by the LFG system's internal timer
    management. It may involve locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety when accessing
    shared queue data structures. The implementation should be efficient as it can
    be invoked multiple times per game tick.
  warnings: Improper handling of queueId or currTime values could lead to incorrect
    timer behavior, potentially causing queues to timeout prematurely or remain stuck
    in waiting states.
