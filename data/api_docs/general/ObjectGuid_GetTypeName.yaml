documentation:
  brief: Returns the type identifier of the ObjectGuid
  description: The GetTypeName method retrieves the type component from an ObjectGuid,
    which represents the kind of object the GUID identifies. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, ObjectGuids are used to uniquely identify game entities such as players,
    creatures, items, and game objects. The type identifier helps distinguish between
    different categories of objects within the game world. This method is commonly
    used in object management, networking, and gameplay logic where the specific type
    of an object needs to be determined from its GUID.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the type identifier of the ObjectGuid. The value
    corresponds to predefined object type constants such as TYPEID_PLAYER (0), TYPEID_UNIT
    (1), TYPEID_ITEM (2), etc., which are defined in the TrinityCore codebase and
    used throughout the game's object management system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine object type
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = player->GetGUID();\nint type = guid.GetTypeName();\n\
      if (type == TYPEID_PLAYER)\n{\n    // Handle player-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in object type checking for game logic
    code: "void ProcessGameObject(ObjectGuid guid)\n{\n    switch (guid.GetTypeName())\n\
      \    {\n        case TYPEID_PLAYER:\n            // Handle player\n        \
      \    break;\n        case TYPEID_UNIT:\n            // Handle creature\n   \
      \         break;\n        case TYPEID_ITEM:\n            // Handle item\n  \
      \          break;\n        default:\n            // Handle unknown type\n  \
      \          break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on the internal representation of the ObjectGuid and
    does not perform any validation or conversion. The returned integer directly corresponds
    to the object type as defined in the TrinityCore source code, making it suitable
    for fast type checking operations in performance-critical game systems.
