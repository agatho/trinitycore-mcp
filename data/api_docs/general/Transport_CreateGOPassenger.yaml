  signature: int * Transport::CreateGOPassenger(int guid, const int * data)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a game object passenger for a transport vehicle
  description: The CreateGOPassenger method initializes and registers a new game object
    passenger on a transport vehicle. This method is typically used when adding passengers
    (such as players or creatures) to a moving transport like a boat or zeppelin.
    The method handles the necessary setup of the passenger's position, orientation,
    and relationship to the transport. It returns a pointer to an integer representing
    the GUID of the created passenger object.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier for the passenger object being created
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an array of integers containing initialization data for
      the passenger, including position coordinates and other relevant properties
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the newly created game
    object passenger, or nullptr if creation fails
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CreateGOPassenger
    code: "int guid = 12345;\nint data[] = {100, 200, 300, 0}; // x, y, z coordinates\n\
      int* result = transport->CreateGOPassenger(guid, data);\nif (result != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Passenger successfully created\n    printf(\"Created passenger with\
      \ GUID: %d\\n\", *result);\n} else {\n    // Failed to create passenger\n  \
      \  printf(\"Failed to create passenger\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the transport system in TrinityCore and should only
    be called when a transport vehicle is properly initialized. The data array must
    contain valid coordinate values for the passenger's initial position relative
    to the transport.
  warnings: Ensure that the guid parameter is unique and not already in use by another
    object. Passing invalid or null data pointers may cause undefined behavior or
    crashes. This method should only be called during transport initialization or
    when adding passengers dynamically.
