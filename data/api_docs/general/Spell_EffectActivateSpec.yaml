  brief: Activates a player's spec by switching their active specialization.
  description: This method activates a player's spec by switching their active specialization,
    effectively changing their current specialization from one to another. It typically
    involves updating the player's talent points and resetting their spell book accordingly.
    The method is commonly used during character creation or when switching between
    specializations in-game. This action can be triggered by various game mechanics
    including class-specific abilities, item usage, or specific spell effects.

  notes: This method likely involves updating the player's talent tree data and may
    require handling of spell book resets. Implementation details are not fully available
    but generally involves updating player state and potentially triggering UI updates.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect player's ability
    to cast spells correctly, especially when switching between different specialization
    types. Improper use could lead to incorrect spell activation or loss of talent
    points.
