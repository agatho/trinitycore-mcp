  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::CheckForAOESituation() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current combat state involves an area-of-effect (AOE)
    situation.
  description: The CheckForAOESituation method evaluates the current combat context
    to determine if the player or NPC is engaged in an area-of-effect scenario. This
    typically involves checking for multiple targets within a specified radius, evaluating
    spell or ability usage patterns, and assessing whether the combat dynamics suggest
    AOE engagement. The method is used by AI systems to adjust behavior, targeting
    strategies, and resource allocation during combat. It does not modify any internal
    state but rather provides a read-only assessment of the current situation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current combat state indicates an area-of-effect scenario,
    such as when multiple enemies are present within a certain proximity or when abilities
    that affect multiple targets are being used. Returns false otherwise, indicating
    single-target or non-AOE combat conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AOE Detection
    code: "if (analyzer.CheckForAOESituation()) {\n    // Switch to AOE-focused strategy\n\
      \    ai->SetBehavior(AI_BEHAVIOR_AOE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Behavior Based on AOE State
    code: "bool isAOE = analyzer.CheckForAOESituation();\nif (isAOE) {\n    // Use\
      \ AoE spells\n    if (player->HasSpell(42531)) // Earthquake\n        player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ 42531, true);\n} else {\n    // Use single-target spells\n    if (player->HasSpell(15487))\
      \ // Fireball\n        player->CastSpell(target, 15487, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal combat state tracking and may not reflect
    real-time changes immediately. It should be called periodically during combat
    updates to ensure accurate detection of AOE situations. The method is optimized
    for performance and does not perform heavy computations.
  warnings: The method assumes that combat state has been properly initialized and
    updated before calling. Calling this method in an uninitialized or invalid combat
    context may lead to incorrect results. Avoid frequent calls in performance-critical
    sections without caching the result.
