  brief: Removes an area trigger associated with a specific aura effect from the unit.
  description: This method removes the area trigger that is linked to a particular
    aura effect, typically used when an aura is removed or expires. The function ensures
    that the area trigger corresponding to the given AuraEffect is properly cleaned
    up and removed from the unit's active area triggers list. This is commonly used
    in conjunction with aura removal mechanics during spell effects or passive abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: aurEff
    description: Pointer to the AuraEffect that defines which area trigger should
      be removed. This parameter must not be null and represents a valid aura effect
      that has been applied to the unit.

      unit->RemoveAreaTrigger(aurEff);'

  notes: The method is typically called during aura removal processes and may involve
    cleanup of area trigger references. It's important to ensure that the aura effect
    passed is valid and not null before calling this function.
  warnings: Improper handling of the aura effect pointer can lead to memory access
    violations or undefined behavior if the pointer is invalid or already deleted.
