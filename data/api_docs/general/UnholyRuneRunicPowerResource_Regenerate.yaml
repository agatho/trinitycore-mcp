documentation:
  brief: Updates the runic power resource for an Unholy Death Knight by regenerating
    energy over time.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for updating the runic power resource
    of an Unholy Death Knight based on the elapsed game time. This method is typically
    called during the game loop to gradually restore runic power, allowing the player
    to perform abilities that consume runic power. The regeneration rate is determined
    by the game's internal mechanics and may be influenced by buffs, talents, or other
    factors specific to the Unholy specialization. This method does not directly interact
    with the player's rune system but manages the associated runic power resource
    independently.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource* powerResource = new UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource();

      uint32 deltaTime = 100; // 100ms elapsed

      powerResource->Regenerate(deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked by the core game loop or resource management
    system. The regeneration process might be paused or modified during certain game
    states such as combat or while under specific spell effects.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the resource management
    system unless you are certain about the timing and context, as it may cause unexpected
    behavior in resource tracking.
