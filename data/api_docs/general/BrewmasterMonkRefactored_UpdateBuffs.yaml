  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void BrewmasterMonkRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Brewmaster Monk's buff states and applies relevant effects based
    on current game conditions.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method manages the internal state of all active buffs
    for a Brewmaster Monk character. It evaluates the player's current condition,
    including health, mana, combat status, and aura presence, to determine which buffs
    should be applied or removed. This method is typically invoked during each update
    cycle to ensure that the monk maintains optimal buff states for gameplay effectiveness.
    The implementation considers factors such as the monk's specialization, level,
    equipped items, and active abilities to make decisions about buff management.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BrewmasterMonkAI::Update()\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n    m_monk.UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly during the game loop, typically
    every tick or update cycle. It may perform conditional checks that could impact
    performance if used excessively outside of proper update contexts. The implementation
    likely relies on internal state tracking and should not be invoked directly from
    combat handlers without considering potential recursion issues.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method manually in situations where it might interfere
    with the normal AI update flow or cause race conditions. Do not invoke UpdateBuffs
    during critical sections of combat logic, as it may modify the monk's state unexpectedly.
