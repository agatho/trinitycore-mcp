documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently disconnected from the session
  description: The PlayerDisconnected method determines whether a player has been
    disconnected from the WorldSession. This boolean check is essential for determining
    the validity of session-based operations and preventing actions on disconnected
    players. The method typically returns true when the player's connection has been
    lost or terminated, and false when the player remains connected. In TrinityCore's
    architecture, this check helps prevent processing of commands or updates for players
    who are no longer actively connected to the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is disconnected from the session, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the session can safely process further operations for the
    player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Disconnection Check
    code: "if (session->PlayerDisconnected()) {\n    // Handle disconnected player\
      \ logic\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_NETWORKIO, \"Player %s is disconnected\"\
      , player->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in game loop processing to skip operations for
    disconnected players. It's important to note that a disconnected session may still
    exist in memory until cleanup occurs, so additional checks might be needed depending
    on the context of usage.
  warnings: Using this method without proper session validation can lead to accessing
    invalid player data. Always ensure that any subsequent operations are safe for
    disconnected players or handle disconnection appropriately before proceeding.
