documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all achievement rewards from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadRewards method is responsible for retrieving all achievement
    reward data from the database and caching it in memory for quick access during
    runtime. This method is typically called during server startup or when the achievement
    system needs to be refreshed. It processes the reward entries associated with
    various achievements, including item rewards, title grants, and other in-game
    benefits that players can earn upon completing specific achievements. The method
    ensures that all reward data is properly loaded and validated before being used
    by the achievement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: AchievementGlobalMgr::instance()->LoadRewards();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    database changes require a reload of reward data. It performs database queries
    and memory allocations, so calling it frequently may impact performance. The method
    assumes that the database connection is already established and valid.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate reward entries. Ensure that any existing reward data
    is properly cleared before reloading.
