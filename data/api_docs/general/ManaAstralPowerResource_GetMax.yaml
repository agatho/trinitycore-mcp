  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 ManaAstralPowerResource::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum mana astral power value for the resource.
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit of mana astral power that
    can be stored or utilized by a player or creature. This value typically represents
    the total capacity of the astral power resource, which may vary based on character
    level, class, equipment, buffs, or other game mechanics. The returned value is
    expressed as a uint32 and corresponds to the maximum possible amount of astral
    power that can be accumulated or spent during gameplay operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum mana astral power capacity. This
    value defines the ceiling for how much astral power can be held or consumed in
    a single resource instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 maxAstralPower = player->GetManaAstralPowerResource()->GetMax();\n\
      // Use maxAstralPower to determine resource limits\nif (player->GetPower(POWER_MANA_ASTRAL)\
      \ >= maxAstralPower)\n{\n    // Handle overflow or full resource condition\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resource management
    functions to enforce limits on astral power usage. The actual maximum value may
    be influenced by temporary modifiers such as buffs, debuffs, or special abilities
    that alter resource capacity.
