  class: MistweaverReNewingMistTracker
  method: GetActiveCount
  signature: uint32 MistweaverReNewingMistTracker::GetActiveCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of active Renewing Mist stacks on the target.
  description: The GetActiveCount method retrieves the current count of active Renewing
    Mist application instances on a target. This tracker is used by the Mistweaver
    class to monitor how many times the Renewing Mist heal has been applied to a specific
    unit. The value represents the number of active ticks or applications of the ability,
    which directly affects the healing output and duration of the effect. This method
    is typically called during combat to determine the optimal timing for refreshing
    or applying additional Renewing Mist effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current number of active Renewing Mist
    stacks on the target. Returns 0 if no stacks are currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Active Stacks Before Refresh
    code: "if (MistweaverReNewingMistTracker* tracker = player->GetMistweaverRenewingMistTracker(target))\n\
      {\n    uint32 activeCount = tracker->GetActiveCount();\n    if (activeCount\
      \ < 5) // Max 5 stacks\n    {\n        // Apply new Renewing Mist\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid target units that have been tracked
    by the Mistweaver's Renewing Mist ability. The returned count may change dynamically
    during combat as stacks are applied, refreshed, or removed due to damage or duration
    expiration.
