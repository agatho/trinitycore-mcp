documentation:
  brief: Casts the Inner Fire spell on the target.
  description: The CastInnerFire method is responsible for executing the Inner Fire
    spell cast by a Priest AI. This spell provides a significant increase to the priest's
    armor and mana regeneration while reducing damage taken from magical attacks.
    The method typically checks if the spell can be cast, ensures the target is valid,
    and then initiates the spell casting sequence. It is part of the general AI behavior
    for Priest NPCs in TrinityCore, handling the logic for when and how Inner Fire
    should be applied during combat.

  - title: Basic usage in Priest AI context
    code: "void PriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim() && !me->IsNonMeleeSpellCast(false))\n\
      \    {\n        CastInnerFire();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the Priest's combat AI logic.
    It assumes that the spell is available and can be cast on the current target.
    The implementation may include checks for cooldowns, mana availability, and target
    validity before casting.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI context has a valid target before calling this method
    to avoid potential issues with spell casting. Also, verify that the spell is properly
    registered in the spell system for the AI to function correctly.
