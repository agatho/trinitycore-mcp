  signature: void World::DisableForcedWarModeFactionBalanceState()
documentation:
  brief: Disables the forced war mode faction balance state in the world.
  description: This method disables the forced war mode faction balance state, which
    typically enforces specific factional balances during war mode gameplay. When
    called, it removes any active restrictions or overrides that were previously applied
    to faction standings while war mode is active. This allows factions to behave
    normally without forced balancing mechanics. The operation affects global world
    state and may have implications for PvP mechanics and faction reputation systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable Forced War Mode Faction Balance
    code: World::instance()->DisableForcedWarModeFactionBalanceState();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal world state flags or configuration values
    that control faction behavior during war mode. It should be called carefully as
    it affects global gameplay mechanics and may require synchronization across the
    server.
  warnings: Calling this method while war mode is active may cause unexpected faction
    behavior or reputation changes. Ensure proper game state management before invoking
    this function to avoid conflicts with ongoing PvP events or faction balance systems.
