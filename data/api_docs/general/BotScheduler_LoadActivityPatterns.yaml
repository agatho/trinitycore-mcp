documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes activity patterns for bot behavior scheduling.
  description: The LoadActivityPatterns method is responsible for loading predefined
    activity schedules and patterns that govern how bots behave over time. This includes
    defining when bots should perform specific actions such as questing, grinding,
    resting, or traveling. The method typically reads from configuration files or
    database entries to populate internal data structures used by the bot scheduler.
    It ensures that all bot activities are properly initialized before the scheduler
    begins executing them according to defined timeframes and conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.LoadActivityPatterns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during the initialization phase of the bot
    system. It may involve file I/O operations or database queries, so performance
    could be impacted if activity patterns are large or complex. The method should
    only be invoked once during startup to avoid redundant loading.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate pattern entries. Ensure that the underlying configuration
    files or database entries are valid and accessible before invoking this method.
