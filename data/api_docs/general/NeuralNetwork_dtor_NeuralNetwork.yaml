  signature: void NeuralNetwork::~NeuralNetwork()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the neural network instance and releases all allocated resources.
  description: The ~NeuralNetwork destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources associated with a NeuralNetwork object. When an instance of the
    NeuralNetwork class goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, this destructor
    is automatically invoked to ensure proper cleanup. It handles deallocation of
    internal data structures such as weight matrices, bias vectors, and any dynamically
    allocated arrays used during neural network computations. This method ensures
    that no memory leaks occur when neural network objects are destroyed, which is
    particularly important in long-running applications like AI-driven game systems
    where multiple neural networks may be created and destroyed during runtime.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of neural network
    code: 'NeuralNetwork* network = new NeuralNetwork();

      // ... use the network ...

      delete network; // Destructor is called here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction with stack allocation
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    NeuralNetwork network;\n    // ... use the network\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only once per object instance. It is important
    to ensure that no other objects hold references to the neural network data structures
    after destruction. The destructor assumes that all internal resources have been
    properly initialized and allocated, so calling it on an uninitialized or partially
    constructed object may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Never call the destructor manually unless you are using placement new.
    The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go out
    of scope or are deleted. Manual invocation can lead to double-free errors if not
    handled carefully.
