  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: UpdateMetaPatterns
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::UpdateMetaPatterns()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the meta patterns associated with the player's current state and
    abilities.
  description: 'The UpdateMetaPatterns method is responsible for recalculating and
    refreshing the meta patterns that define a player''s current set of abilities,
    talents, and skill configurations. This method typically runs during key gameplay
    events such as level-ups, talent point allocations, or when abilities are unlocked.
    It ensures that the player''s pattern recognition system accurately reflects their
    updated character state. The method may also trigger updates to related systems
    like spell casting, ability cooldowns, or combat behavior. Precondition: The PlayerPatternRecognition
    object must be properly initialized and associated with a valid player instance.
    Postcondition: All meta patterns are refreshed and synchronized with the current
    player state.'
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Update Loop
    code: "void Player::UpdatePlayerPatterns()\n{\n    if (m_patternRecognition)\n\
      \        m_patternRecognition->UpdateMetaPatterns();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Talent Point Changes
    code: "void Player::OnTalentPointSpent()\n{\n    // ... talent logic ...\n   \
      \ m_patternRecognition->UpdateMetaPatterns();\n    // ... rest of logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications if called too frequently during
    intensive gameplay events. It is recommended to batch pattern updates or defer
    them until the end of a game tick. The method relies on internal player state
    tracking, so calling it before the player object is fully initialized may result
    in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method from within tight loops or high-frequency update
    contexts without proper throttling. Improper use can lead to excessive CPU usage
    or inconsistent pattern states. Also ensure that the PlayerPatternRecognition
    instance is valid and not destroyed before invoking this method.
