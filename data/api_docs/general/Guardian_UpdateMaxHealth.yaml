  signature: void Guardian::UpdateMaxHealth()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the maximum health value of the guardian based on its current level
    and other modifiers.
  description: The UpdateMaxHealth method recalculates and sets the maximum health
    points for a Guardian creature. This method is typically invoked when the guardian's
    level changes, or when other factors affecting its health capacity are modified.
    It ensures that the guardian's health pool accurately reflects its current stats
    and progression within the game world. The calculation considers base health values,
    level multipliers, and any applicable buffs or debuffs that may affect the guardian's
    maximum health.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = new Guardian();

      guardian->UpdateMaxHealth();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Level Change
    code: "if (guardian->GetLevel() != previousLevel)\n{\n    guardian->UpdateMaxHealth();\n\
      \    guardian->SetHealth(guardian->GetMaxHealth()); // Ensure health is within\
      \ new max\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever the guardian's level or stat modifiers
    change to maintain accurate health calculations. It internally uses the creature's
    base health values and level scaling factors to compute the new maximum health.
