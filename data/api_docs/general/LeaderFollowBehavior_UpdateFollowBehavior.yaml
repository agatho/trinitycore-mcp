  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: UpdateFollowBehavior
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::UpdateFollowBehavior(BotAI * ai, int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the leader follow behavior for a bot AI instance based on time difference.
  description: The UpdateFollowBehavior method is responsible for managing and updating
    the follower behavior of a bot within the TrinityCore AI system. It takes a BotAI
    instance and a time difference parameter to determine how the bot should react
    in relation to its leader, including movement, positioning, and combat behavior.
    This method typically handles pathfinding, maintaining distance from the leader,
    and responding to changes in the leader's state or environment. The implementation
    likely involves checking the leader's current status, updating the follower's
    position relative to the leader, and ensuring proper AI decision-making based
    on game mechanics such as group dynamics and threat management.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the behavior of the bot.
      This parameter is required and must not be null for the method to function properly.
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since last update. Used to calculate
      movement timing, cooldowns, and behavior transitions based on elapsed time.
  returns: None. This method performs updates directly on the BotAI instance and does
    not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateFollowBehavior Usage
    code: "void Update() {\n    if (botAI) {\n        int diff = getDiff();\n    \
      \    leaderFollowBehavior.UpdateFollowBehavior(botAI, diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (IsFollowing()) {\n \
      \       leaderFollowBehavior.UpdateFollowBehavior(this, diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the main AI update loop of a bot.
    It's important that the BotAI instance passed to this method has valid data about
    its leader and current state. Performance can be affected if diff values are too
    large or inconsistent, leading to erratic behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for ai parameter will likely cause a crash or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that diff is a positive integer representing actual elapsed time
    in milliseconds.
