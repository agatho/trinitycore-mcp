  signature: void SpellMgr::UnloadSpellInfoStore()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all loaded spell information from memory, releasing associated resources.
  description: The UnloadSpellInfoStore method is responsible for removing all currently
    loaded spell data from the SpellMgr's internal storage. This function typically
    releases memory allocated for spell definitions, effects, and related metadata
    that was previously loaded during server initialization or dynamic loading phases.
    It ensures that spell information is completely cleared from memory, which can
    be useful during server shutdown, hot-reloading of spell data, or when resetting
    the spell system state. The method does not take any parameters and performs no
    return operations, making it a simple cleanup utility for spell-related resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Shutdown
    code: "void World::Shutdown()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->UnloadSpellInfoStore();\n   \
      \ // Other shutdown logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no active spell processing is occurring,
    as it invalidates all previously loaded spell data. It's typically used during
    server maintenance or before reloading spell definitions to prevent memory leaks.
  warnings: Calling this method while spells are actively being cast or processed
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that all spell operations
    have completed before invoking this function.
