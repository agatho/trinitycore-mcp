  class: PaladinAI
  method: GetHolyPower
  signature: int PaladinAI::GetHolyPower() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current amount of Holy Power available to the Paladin AI.
  description: The GetHolyPower method returns the number of Holy Power stacks currently
    possessed by the Paladin AI. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    Holy Power is a resource system used primarily by Paladins for various abilities
    such as Judgement, Flash of Light, and Divine Storm. This method provides access
    to the internal Holy Power counter maintained by the AI logic, allowing other
    systems or scripts to query the current resource level without directly manipulating
    the state. The returned value typically ranges from 0 to 3, representing the standard
    maximum stacks available to a Paladin character.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of Holy Power stacks currently
    available to the Paladin AI. Valid values are typically 0 through 3, where 0 indicates
    no Holy Power and 3 represents the maximum stack capacity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int holyPower = ai->GetHolyPower();\nif (holyPower > 0)\n{\n    // Use\
      \ a Holy Power consuming ability\n    // e.g., cast Judgement or Flash of Light\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Casting
    code: "PaladinAI* paladinAI = dynamic_cast<PaladinAI*>(ai);\nif (paladinAI)\n\
      {\n    int power = paladinAI->GetHolyPower();\n    if (power >= 3)\n    {\n\
      \        // Cast Divine Storm when at max Holy Power\n        paladinAI->DoCastSpellIfCan(target,\
      \ SPELL_DIVINE_STORM);\n    }\n    else if (power >= 1)\n    {\n        // Cast\
      \ Judgement with available Holy Power\n        paladinAI->DoCastSpellIfCan(target,\
      \ SPELL_JUDGEMENT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Paladin AI subsystem and should only be called
    on instances of classes derived from PaladinAI. The returned value reflects the
    current internal state of Holy Power and may change based on combat events, spell
    casts, or other game mechanics that affect resource accumulation.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value guarantees that all abilities
    requiring Holy Power can be cast immediately, as additional conditions such as
    cooldowns or target requirements might apply. Also, this method should not be
    used to directly modify the Holy Power state; use appropriate AI methods for resource
    management.
