  method: PetSpellInitialize
  signature: void Player::PetSpellInitialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the player's pet spell book with default spells and updates the
    client UI.
  description: The PetSpellInitialize method sets up the player's pet spell book by
    loading default pet spells into the pet's spell list. This method is typically
    called when a pet is summoned or created, ensuring that the pet has access to
    its basic set of spells. It synchronizes the pet's spell data with the client
    interface, making the spells visible and usable in the pet's spellbook. The method
    handles the internal initialization of pet spell entries and ensures proper communication
    between the server and the client for spell visibility.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize pet spells after summoning
    code: "void Player::OnPetSummoned()\n{\n    // ... pet summoning logic ...\n \
      \   PetSpellInitialize();\n    // ... rest of summoning logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a pet is properly initialized and
    has a valid spell book. It internally handles the synchronization of spell data
    to the client, so manual UI updates are not required. The method may trigger additional
    internal events related to pet spell availability.
  warnings: Calling this method on a player without an active pet may result in undefined
    behavior or no effect. Ensure that the pet exists and is properly initialized
    before calling this method.
