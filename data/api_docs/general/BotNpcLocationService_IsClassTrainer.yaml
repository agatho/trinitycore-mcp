api:
  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: IsClassTrainer
  signature: bool BotNpcLocationService::IsClassTrainer(uint32 creatureEntry, uint8
    classId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature entry corresponds to a class trainer for the
    specified class.
  description: The IsClassTrainer method checks if a given NPC creature entry is a
    class trainer specifically for the provided class ID. This utility function is
    typically used in bot AI logic to identify NPCs that can train players in specific
    classes. The method likely queries internal databases or cached data structures
    to determine trainer availability and class specialization. It's commonly employed
    in automated questing or training routines where bots need to locate appropriate
    trainers for their character's class.
  parameters:
  - name: creatureEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the creature/NPC to check. This
      corresponds to the 'entry' field in the creature_template table.
  - name: classId
    description: The class ID to verify trainer specialization against. Valid values
      correspond to the Class field in the playercreateinfo table, typically 1-11
      for standard WoW classes (Warrior, Paladin, Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Death Knight,
      Shaman, Mage, Warlock, Druid, Monk).
  returns: Returns true if the creature entry is a class trainer specifically for
    the given class ID; otherwise returns false. This indicates that the NPC can train
    players in the specified class.
  examples:
  - title: Check if NPC is a Warrior Trainer
    code: "if (BotNpcLocationService::IsClassTrainer(3215, CLASS_WARRIOR)) {\n   \
      \ // This NPC is a warrior trainer\n    printf(\"Found warrior trainer\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in Bot AI Logic
    code: "uint32 trainerEntry = 12345;\nuint8 playerClass = player->getClass();\n\
      if (BotNpcLocationService::IsClassTrainer(trainerEntry, playerClass)) {\n  \
      \  // Proceed with class-specific training actions\n    bot->TalkToTrainer(trainerEntry);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on cached or pre-loaded data about NPC trainers
    and their specializations. It may not reflect real-time changes to trainer availability
    or class restrictions in the game world. The implementation might involve lookups
    against internal mappings or database queries, so performance should be considered
    when used frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that the classId parameter corresponds to valid class values as
    defined by the game's internal class system. Using invalid class IDs may result
    in incorrect behavior or false negatives. Be aware that this method may not account
    for temporary restrictions or quest-based trainer access limitations.
