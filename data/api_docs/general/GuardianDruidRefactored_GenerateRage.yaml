  method: GenerateRage
  signature: void GuardianDruidRefactored::GenerateRage(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates rage for the Guardian Druid based on the specified amount.
  description: The GenerateRage method is responsible for increasing the rage resource
    of a Guardian Druid character. This method typically gets invoked during gameplay
    when the druid performs actions that should generate rage, such as attacking enemies
    or using certain abilities. Rage is a key resource in the Guardian Druid's gameplay
    loop, used to fuel special abilities and enhance combat effectiveness. The method
    accepts an unsigned 32-bit integer representing the amount of rage to be generated.
    It updates the druid's internal rage value, ensuring it does not exceed the maximum
    rage cap defined by the game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of rage points to generate for the Guardian Druid. This
      value must be a non-negative integer. Valid values typically range from 0 to
      several hundred depending on the specific game context and ability used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rage Generation
    code: 'GuardianDruidRefactored druid;

      druid.GenerateRage(10);

      // Generates 10 rage points for the druid.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Rage Generation on Attack
    code: "void OnPlayerAttack(Unit* target) {\n    if (player->GetClass() == CLASS_DRUID\
      \ && player->GetSubClass() == SPEC_GUARDIAN) {\n        GuardianDruidRefactored*\
      \ guardian = static_cast<GuardianDruidRefactored*>(player);\n        guardian->GenerateRage(5);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the druid's current rage value and maximum
    rage cap. It may also trigger visual or auditory feedback to the player when rage
    is generated. The implementation might include checks to ensure that rage generation
    doesn't exceed limits or cause unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is validated before calling this method
    to prevent negative rage values or overflow conditions. Improper usage could lead
    to inconsistent gameplay states or resource manipulation issues.
