  class: EnhancedBotAIFactory
  method: CreateShamanAI
  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateShamanAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a Shaman AI for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreateShamanAI method is responsible for instantiating and configuring
    a Shaman-specific Artificial Intelligence behavior for a given bot player within
    the TrinityCore framework. This function likely sets up the bot's spell casting
    priorities, movement patterns, and combat strategies tailored to the Shaman class.
    The method operates within the EnhancedBotAI system, which extends standard AI
    functionality to provide more sophisticated bot behaviors. It may involve initializing
    specific Shaman abilities, setting up resource management logic (such as mana
    or totems), and establishing decision-making processes that align with Shaman
    gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid player reference,
    unsupported class type, or resource allocation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shaman AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume a valid bot player object\nint result = factory->CreateShamanAI(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully created for the bot\n    printf(\"\
      Shaman AI created successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to create Shaman AI, error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger EnhancedBotAI framework and likely requires
    the bot player to be properly initialized before calling. The returned integer
    value should be checked for proper error handling in production code. Implementation
    details may vary depending on the specific version of TrinityCore being used.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player* parameter points to a valid, initialized bot object
    with the Shaman class. Calling this method on non-Shaman bots or uninitialized
    players may result in undefined behavior or crashes. The method should only be
    called during appropriate initialization phases of the bot lifecycle.
