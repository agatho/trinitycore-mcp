  signature: void MovementRequest::MovementRequest(PlayerBotMovementPriority priority,
    std::string reason)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a movement request with specified priority and reason for a player
    bot.
  description: The MovementRequest constructor initializes a new movement request
    object for a player bot, setting its priority level and descriptive reason. This
    method is typically used within the TrinityCore AI framework to queue or schedule
    movement actions for automated player characters. The priority determines how
    urgently the movement should be processed relative to other requests, while the
    reason provides context for debugging or logging purposes. Movement requests are
    commonly used in bot behavior scripting to control NPC or player bot movement
    patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: Specifies the priority level of this movement request. Higher priority
      movements are processed before lower priority ones. Valid values are typically
      defined by the PlayerBotMovementPriority enum, such as LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or
      CRITICAL.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining why this movement request was created.
      This is useful for debugging and logging purposes to understand the context
      of bot movements. Should be a meaningful description related to the bot's current
      behavior or goal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Request Initialization
    code: MovementRequest request(PlayerBotMovementPriority::HIGH, "Moving to target
      position");
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Low Priority Movement Request
    code: MovementRequest request(PlayerBotMovementPriority::LOW, "Idle wandering
      around area");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI movement system in TrinityCore. It
    does not directly perform movement but rather creates a request that will be processed
    by the bot's movement manager. The actual movement execution depends on the bot's
    current state and other factors like pathfinding availability.
  warnings: Ensure that the priority value passed is valid according to the PlayerBotMovementPriority
    enum, otherwise behavior may be undefined. The reason string should not contain
    sensitive information as it might be logged in debug output.
