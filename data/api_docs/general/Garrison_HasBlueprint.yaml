documentation:
  brief: Checks if the garrison has a specific blueprint available.
  description: The HasBlueprint method determines whether a given building blueprint
    is available within the garrison. This check is typically used to verify if a
    player can construct or upgrade a specific building type. The method evaluates
    the garrison's current state and available blueprints, returning true if the specified
    blueprint exists and is accessible, false otherwise. This functionality is integral
    to the garrison system's building management and construction logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified blueprint (identified by garrBuildingId)
    is available in the garrison, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Blueprint Availability
    code: "if (garrison->HasBlueprint(1234)) {\n    // Blueprint is available, proceed\
      \ with building logic\n    printf(\"Blueprint 1234 is available\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Blueprint not available\n    printf(\"Blueprint 1234 is not available\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal garrison data structures that
    track unlocked blueprints. It may be called frequently during building placement
    or upgrade operations, so performance should be considered in high-frequency usage
    scenarios.
