documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase instance and cleans up associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were managed
    by this instance. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this class likely serves as a base for persistent script data stored within instance
    zones. The destructor ensures proper cleanup of any internal data structures,
    such as saved variables, timers, or references to game objects, before the object
    is fully removed from memory. This method is automatically invoked when an object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of instance script value
    code: 'PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase* scriptValue = new PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase();

      // ... perform operations with the object ...

      delete scriptValue; // Triggers ~PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called during object destruction. Developers
    should not manually invoke destructors unless implementing custom memory management
    patterns. Since this is a base class, derived classes may have their own destructors
    that are called before this one in the inheritance chain.
