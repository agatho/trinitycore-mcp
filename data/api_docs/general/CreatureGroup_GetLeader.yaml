  signature: Creature * CreatureGroup::GetLeader() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the leader creature of the creature group.
  description: The GetLeader method retrieves the Creature object that serves as the
    leader of the current creature group. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    creature groups are used to manage collections of creatures that behave as a unit,
    often for AI purposes such as patrols or coordinated attacks. The leader is typically
    the primary creature in the group that controls group behavior and movement. This
    method provides access to the leader creature's data and functionality, allowing
    other systems to interact with or query the group's central entity. The returned
    pointer may be null if the group has no defined leader, which can occur during
    initialization or if the leader has been removed from the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Creature object that is the leader of this creature group,
    or nullptr if no leader exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check and use group leader
    code: "CreatureGroup* group = ...; // Assume group is initialized\nCreature* leader\
      \ = group->GetLeader();\nif (leader != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the leader creature\
      \ for further operations\n    LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Group leader GUID: {}\"\
      , leader->GetGUID().ToString());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using group leader to trigger an action
    code: "CreatureGroup* group = player->GetCreatureGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n   \
      \ Creature* leader = group->GetLeader();\n    if (leader && leader->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        // Perform some action on the group leader\n        leader->AI()->DoAction(1);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI and group management systems within TrinityCore.
    The returned Creature pointer is valid only as long as the creature group exists
    and the leader has not been removed or destroyed. It's important to check for
    null returns before dereferencing the pointer.
  warnings: Accessing the leader of a creature group that has been destroyed or improperly
    initialized may result in undefined behavior. Always verify that the returned
    pointer is not null before using it in operations that require a valid Creature
    object.
