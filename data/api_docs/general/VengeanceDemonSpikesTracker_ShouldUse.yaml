  class: VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker
  method: ShouldUse
  signature: bool VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker::ShouldUse(float incomingDamageRate,
    float healthPct) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Vengeance Demon Spikes ability should be used based
    on incoming damage rate and current health percentage.
  description: The ShouldUse method evaluates whether the Vengeance Demon Spikes ability
    should be activated by analyzing the rate of incoming damage and the player's
    current health percentage. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    logic to determine optimal usage of defensive abilities. The implementation likely
    considers thresholds for both damage rate and health percentage to decide when
    the ability becomes beneficial to use, balancing between avoiding overuse and
    ensuring adequate protection during high-damage periods.
  parameters:
  - name: incomingDamageRate
    description: The rate of damage being received per second, used to assess threat
      level and urgency for using the ability
  - name: healthPct
    description: Current health percentage of the player, used to determine if the
      player is at risk of dying and needs defensive action
  returns: Returns true if the Vengeance Demon Spikes ability should be used based
    on the provided damage rate and health percentage; otherwise returns false
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision logic
    code: "if (vengeanceTracker.ShouldUse(1500.0f, 30.0f)) {\n    // Use Vengeance\
      \ Demon Spikes ability\n    player->CastSpell(VENGEANCE_DEMON_SPIKES_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with damage monitoring system
    code: "float damageRate = damageTracker.GetAverageDamagePerSecond();\nfloat healthPct\
      \ = (player->GetHealth() * 100.0f) / player->GetMaxHealth();\n\nif (vengeanceTracker.ShouldUse(damageRate,\
      \ healthPct)) {\n    // Execute defensive action\n    vengeanceTracker.UseAbility();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger combat decision system and may be
    called frequently during combat scenarios. The exact thresholds for damage rate
    and health percentage are implementation-specific and should be tuned based on
    game balance requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the incomingDamageRate parameter represents actual damage
    being inflicted rather than projected damage, as incorrect values could lead to
    inappropriate ability usage decisions.
