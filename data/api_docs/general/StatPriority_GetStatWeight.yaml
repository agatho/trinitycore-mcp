documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the weight value assigned to a specific stat type for priority
    calculations.
  description: The GetStatWeight method returns the numerical weight associated with
    a given stat type within the StatPriority system. This weight is used to determine
    the relative importance of different stats when calculating optimal stat distributions
    for character builds, especially in the context of itemization and gear prioritization.
    The method takes a StatType parameter representing the specific stat (such as
    Strength, Agility, Intellect, etc.) and returns its corresponding weight value
    as a float. This functionality is commonly used in TrinityCore's simulation crafting
    and optimization systems to evaluate how much each stat contributes to overall
    performance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the weight assigned to the specified stat type.
    Higher values indicate higher priority or importance of that stat in calculations.
    Returns 0.0 if the stat type is not recognized or has no assigned weight.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Weight for Critical Strike Stat
    code: 'StatPriority priority;

      float critWeight = priority.GetStatWeight(STAT_CRITICAL_STRIKE);

      // Returns the weight value assigned to critical strike stat

      std::cout << "Critical Strike Weight: " << critWeight << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate Through All Stat Weights
    code: "StatPriority priority;\nfor (int i = 0; i < MAX_STAT_TYPE; ++i)\n{\n  \
      \  StatType stat = static_cast<StatType>(i);\n    float weight = priority.GetStatWeight(stat);\n\
      \    if (weight > 0.0f)\n    {\n        std::cout << \"Stat \" << stat << \"\
      \ has weight: \" << weight << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that stat weights are pre-configured within the StatPriority
    object. The implementation likely relies on internal data structures such as maps
    or arrays to store and retrieve these weights efficiently. It's important to note
    that this method does not validate whether the stat type is valid; it simply returns
    whatever weight is associated with the given stat type.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without verifying that the StatPriority
    object has been properly initialized with valid stat weights. Using an uninitialized
    or improperly configured StatPriority object may result in unexpected behavior
    or incorrect calculations.
