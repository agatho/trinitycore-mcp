  signature: BotWorldEntryQueue & BotWorldEntryQueue::operator=(const BotWorldEntryQueue
    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotWorldEntryQueue object to another
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy assignment of a BotWorldEntryQueue
    object, transferring all internal data and state from the source object to the
    target object. This is a standard copy assignment operator that ensures proper
    memory management and data integrity when copying queue entries. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this operation is typically used when managing world
    entry queues for AI-controlled characters, ensuring that queue configurations,
    priorities, and entry data are correctly duplicated between instances.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotWorldEntryQueue object to copy from. This parameter
      must be a valid, initialized object containing the queue data to be assigned
      to the current instance.
  returns: A reference to the current BotWorldEntryQueue object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Operation
    code: 'BotWorldEntryQueue queue1;

      BotWorldEntryQueue queue2 = queue1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      queue2 = queue1; // Uses operator=

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotWorldEntryQueue queue1, queue2, queue3;

      // ... populate queues with data ...

      queue3 = queue2 = queue1; // Chained assignment

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements deep copying to avoid issues with shared
    pointers or dynamically allocated memory. It's important to ensure that the source
    object is in a valid state before assignment to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: When using this operator, be cautious of potential self-assignment scenarios
    (queue = queue). While modern implementations typically handle this case safely,
    it's good practice to avoid such patterns when possible.
