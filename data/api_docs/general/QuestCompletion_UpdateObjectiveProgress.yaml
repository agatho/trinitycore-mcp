  class: QuestCompletion
  method: UpdateObjectiveProgress
  signature: void QuestCompletion::UpdateObjectiveProgress(Player * bot, uint32 questId,
    uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the progress of a specified quest objective for a player bot.
  description: The UpdateObjectiveProgress method is used to modify the completion
    status of a specific objective within a quest for a given player bot. This function
    typically adjusts the quest's progress state, potentially advancing the player's
    quest log or triggering related events such as item rewards or quest completion
    checks. It operates on a single objective index within the context of a specified
    quest ID and is commonly used in automated questing systems or AI-driven bots
    to simulate player actions. The method does not return any value but modifies
    internal quest state data.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest progress
      will be updated. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which the objective progress is
      being updated. Must correspond to an existing active quest in the bot's quest
      log.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index of the specific objective within the quest that needs to be
      progressed. Zero-based indexing, must refer to a valid objective within the
      quest structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update progress for the first objective of a quest
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 objectiveIndex = 0;

      QuestCompletion::UpdateObjectiveProgress(myBot, questId, objectiveIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided quest and objective indices are valid
    and exist in the bot's current quest log. It may trigger internal quest state
    updates and should be used carefully to avoid inconsistencies in quest progression
    logic.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid questId or objectiveIndex values can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all parameters are validated before
    calling this function.
