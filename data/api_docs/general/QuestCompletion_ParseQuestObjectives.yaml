  class: QuestCompletion
  method: ParseQuestObjectives
  signature: void QuestCompletion::ParseQuestObjectives(QuestProgressData & progress,
    const Quest * quest)
documentation:
  brief: Parses quest objectives and updates the progress data for a given quest.
  description: The ParseQuestObjectives method processes the objectives defined in
    a quest and updates the provided QuestProgressData structure with relevant completion
    information. This method is typically invoked when a player interacts with quest-related
    content, such as killing mobs or collecting items, to determine if their progress
    towards completing the quest has changed. It ensures that the internal state of
    the quest progress reflects the current status of the player's actions in the
    game world.
  parameters:
  - name: progress
    description: A reference to a QuestProgressData structure that holds the current
      progress information for the quest.
  - name: quest
    description: A pointer to the Quest object which defines the objectives and requirements
      for the quest being processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'QuestProgressData progress;

      const Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      questCompletion.ParseQuestObjectives(progress, quest);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest handling system in TrinityCore
    and should not be called directly by external code unless implementing custom
    quest logic. It modifies the progress data in place and relies on the integrity
    of the provided Quest object.
  warnings: Ensure that the Quest object passed to this method is valid and not null,
    otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method does not perform any validation
    on the input parameters beyond basic pointer checks.
