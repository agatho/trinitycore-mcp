  class: LFGQueue
  method: RemoveFromQueue
  signature: void LFGQueue::RemoveFromQueue(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the LFG queue using their GUID.
  description: The RemoveFromQueue method removes a specific player, identified by
    their globally unique identifier (GUID), from the Looking For Group (LFG) queue
    system. This function is typically invoked when a player cancels their LFG request,
    leaves a group, or when the system needs to clean up inactive queue entries. The
    method ensures that the player's data is properly removed from internal tracking
    structures without leaving stale entries that could interfere with matchmaking
    processes. It is an essential part of maintaining clean and efficient LFG queue
    management within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed
      from the LFG queue. This value uniquely identifies the player within the game
      world and is typically obtained from player objects or session data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetLFGQueueForPlayer(playerGuid);\nif (lfgQueue)\n\
      {\n    lfgQueue->RemoveFromQueue(playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Player from Queue with Error Handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerLeaveLFG(Player* player)\n{\n    uint64 guid = player->GetGUID();\n\
      \    LFGQueue* queue = sLFGMgr->GetLFGQueueForPlayer(guid);\n    if (queue)\n\
      \    {\n        queue->RemoveFromQueue(guid);\n        // Additional cleanup\
      \ or notification logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and operates on the LFG queue data structure which
    is managed by the LFG manager. It performs internal checks to ensure that only
    valid entries are removed, preventing potential crashes from invalid GUIDs or
    already-removed players.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or silent failures. Always verify that the player exists and
    is actually queued before calling this function.
