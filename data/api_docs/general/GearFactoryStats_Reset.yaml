documentation:
  brief: Resets all statistics and counters within the GearFactoryStats instance to
    their initial default values.
  description: The Reset method clears all accumulated statistics and counters stored
    in the GearFactoryStats class, restoring them to their original state. This method
    is typically used when starting a new gear generation cycle or when resetting
    performance tracking data. It ensures that subsequent operations begin with clean
    metrics and does not preserve any previous statistical information. The method
    performs no parameter validation as it takes no arguments and operates entirely
    on internal state variables.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GearFactoryStats stats;

      // ... perform some gear generation operations ...

      stats.Reset(); // Reset all collected statistics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe if used in a single-threaded context.
    However, concurrent access from multiple threads without proper synchronization
    may lead to race conditions. The implementation assumes that internal counters
    and statistics are reset to zero or default values upon invocation.
