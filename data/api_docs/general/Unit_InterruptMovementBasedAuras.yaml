  signature: void Unit::InterruptMovementBasedAuras()
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts all movement-based auras currently active on the unit.
  description: The InterruptMovementBasedAuras method stops any ongoing aura effects
    that are dependent on movement, such as those caused by spells like Sprint, Dash,
    or other movement-activated abilities. This function is typically invoked when
    a unit's movement is forcibly halted or interrupted, ensuring that related aura
    states are properly cleared and reset. It affects only auras explicitly marked
    as movement-based, and does not interfere with other types of auras such as damage-over-time
    or buff effects. The method ensures consistent game state management by cleanly
    terminating movement-dependent effects.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Interrupting Movement-Based Auras on Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->InterruptMovementBasedAuras();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat Interrupt Logic
    code: "Unit* target = ...;\nif (target->HasAuraType(SPELL_AURA_MOD_SPEED))\n{\n\
      \    target->InterruptMovementBasedAuras();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally iterates through the unit's active aura list and identifies
    auras with movement-based effects. It is commonly called during combat state changes,
    spell interrupts, or when a unit is stunned or rooted. The function does not directly
    remove the aura from the unit's aura application; instead, it signals that the
    aura should be interrupted or canceled.
  warnings: This method should only be called when movement-based auras are known
    to be active and need immediate interruption. Calling this on units without such
    auras may result in unnecessary processing overhead. Additionally, calling this
    during aura application or removal cycles can lead to undefined behavior if not
    handled carefully.
