  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: OnCharacterSelected
  signature: void BotSpawnOrchestrator::OnCharacterSelected(int characterGuid, const
    int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot character is selected in the game world.
  description: The OnCharacterSelected method is invoked when a player selects a bot
    character within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically initializes
    or activates the bot's behavior, sets up necessary data structures, and prepares
    the character for interaction with the game environment. It serves as a key entry
    point in the bot spawning orchestration system, ensuring that selected characters
    are properly configured before being used by the AI system. The method may also
    perform validation checks on the character GUID and request parameters to ensure
    integrity of the selection process.
  parameters:
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character that was selected.
      This value is used to locate and reference the specific character instance within
      the game world.
  - name: request
    description: A constant reference to an integer representing the request type
      or context associated with the character selection. This parameter may indicate
      whether the selection is for spawning, reinitialization, or another operation
      related to bot management.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void BotSpawnOrchestrator::OnCharacterSelected(int characterGuid, const\
      \ int & request)\n{\n    // Validate the GUID\n    if (characterGuid <= 0) return;\n\
      \    \n    // Initialize bot behavior based on request type\n    switch (request)\n\
      \    {\n        case 1:\n            // Spawn new bot\n            break;\n\
      \        case 2:\n            // Reinitialize existing bot\n            break;\n\
      \        default:\n            // Handle unknown request\n            break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core bot management system and should be called
    only when a valid character selection occurs. Ensure that all related data structures
    are thread-safe if this method is invoked from multiple contexts.
  warnings: Improper handling of the characterGuid or request parameters can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate input before proceeding with
    bot initialization logic.
