  method: GetArtifactCategoryId
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetArtifactCategoryId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the artifact category ID associated with the quest.
  description: This method retrieves the artifact category identifier that is linked
    to a specific quest in the TrinityCore database. The artifact category ID is used
    to determine which artifact-related content a quest unlocks or relates to. This
    method is typically used during quest processing and artifact progression mechanics
    to identify the correct artifact category for a given quest. It ensures proper
    handling of artifact-related quest rewards and progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the artifact category ID associated with
    the quest. If no artifact category is defined for the quest, it returns 0. This
    value corresponds to the ArtifactCategory.db2 entry in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 categoryId = quest->GetArtifactCategoryId();\nif (categoryId > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Process artifact category\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used in conjunction
    with other artifact-related methods. The method does not perform any database
    queries or operations; it simply returns cached data from the quest's internal
    structure.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return 0 if no artifact
    category is defined for a quest, which could lead to incorrect artifact progression
    handling if not properly checked. Ensure that the quest object is valid before
    calling this method.
