  class: Unit
  method: SendMeleeAttackStart
  signature: void Unit::SendMeleeAttackStart(Unit * victim)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates melee attack animation and sends attack start packet to target
    unit
  description: This method triggers the melee attack animation for the calling unit
    and sends a packet to the target unit indicating that the attack has started.
    It is used to initiate combat behavior between units, typically when a unit begins
    attacking another unit in melee range. The method handles the visual representation
    of the attack start and ensures proper communication between the attacker and
    target through network packets.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: The target unit that will receive the attack start packet. This parameter
      must be a valid Unit pointer, typically representing an enemy unit or player
      in combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetVictim();

      Unit::SendMeleeAttackStart(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with combat handling
    code: "if (target && target->IsInWorld()) {\n    Unit::SendMeleeAttackStart(target);\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Handle invalid target case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine during combat
    initiation. It may be used in conjunction with other combat-related methods like
    SendMeleeAttackStop or SendAttackStateUpdate. The method does not directly perform
    damage calculation but rather initiates the attack animation and communication.
  warnings: The method requires that the victim parameter is a valid pointer to an
    existing unit. Passing null pointers or invalid units may cause crashes or undefined
    behavior. Care should be taken when using this method in combat scenarios as it
    directly affects the visual representation of combat actions.
