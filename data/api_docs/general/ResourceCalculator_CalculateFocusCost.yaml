api:
  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: CalculateFocusCost
  signature: uint32 ResourceCalculator::CalculateFocusCost(uint32 spellId, int * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the focus cost for a specified spell based on the caster's properties.
  description: The CalculateFocusCost method determines the amount of focus resource
    required to cast a given spell. It takes into account the spell ID and the caster's
    characteristics, such as class, level, and any applicable buffs or debuffs that
    might affect focus cost. This calculation is essential for determining whether
    a player or creature has sufficient focus to cast a spell. The method typically
    interacts with internal spell and resource management systems within TrinityCore
    to retrieve relevant data about the spell and the caster.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which the focus cost is being
      calculated. This ID must correspond to a valid spell entry in the database.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's index or identifier.
      This parameter may be used to access the caster's properties, such as class,
      level, or focus-related modifiers.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated focus cost required
    to cast the specified spell. A return value of zero indicates no focus cost or
    an error in calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 focusCost = ResourceCalculator::CalculateFocusCost(12345, &casterIndex);
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Focus Before Casting
    code: "int casterIndex = 0;\nuint32 spellId = 12345;\nuint32 focusCost = ResourceCalculator::CalculateFocusCost(spellId,\
      \ &casterIndex);\nif (focusCost > 0 && player->GetPower(POWER_FOCUS) >= focusCost)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger resource management system and may
    be called during spell validation or pre-cast checks. The caster parameter might
    not always be directly used, depending on how focus cost is determined internally.
  warnings: Ensure the provided spellId corresponds to an actual spell in the database;
    otherwise, the result may be invalid or zero. Also, verify that the caster pointer
    points to a valid entity with appropriate resource properties.
