  method: GetPlayerCount
  signature: uint8 LfgGroupData::GetPlayerCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of players currently in the LFG group
  description: The GetPlayerCount method retrieves the total number of players that
    are part of the Looking For Group (LFG) group associated with this LfgGroupData
    instance. This count includes all players regardless of their role or status within
    the group, such as whether they are queued, in a dungeon, or waiting for a leader.
    The method is typically used by the LFG system to determine group composition
    and manage queue operations. It provides a quick way to assess how many players
    are currently participating in a specific LFG group without needing to iterate
    through player lists manually.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the total number of players in the LFG group.
    The value will be between 0 and the maximum allowed players for the group type
    (typically 1-5 for most LFG scenarios). Returns 0 if the group is empty or has
    been cleared.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group size
    code: "LfgGroupData* groupData = sLFGMgr->GetGroupData(playerGuid);\nuint8 playerCount\
      \ = groupData->GetPlayerCount();\nif (playerCount > 0) {\n    // Process group\
      \ members\n    sLog->outString(\"Group has %u players\", playerCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using player count to validate group readiness
    code: "LfgGroupData* groupData = sLFGMgr->GetGroupData(groupId);\nuint8 playerCount\
      \ = groupData->GetPlayerCount();\nif (playerCount >= 1 && playerCount <= 5)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with dungeon matching logic\n    sLFGMgr->UpdateLfgGroup(groupId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid group size\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid LFG\
      \ group size: %u\", playerCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a read-only accessor that does not modify any internal state.
    It's designed to be called frequently during LFG operations, so performance should
    be optimal. The returned value directly reflects the current state of the group's
    player membership and may change dynamically as players join or leave.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns an unsigned 8-bit integer, which means
    it can only represent values from 0 to 255. While LFG groups typically contain
    fewer than 10 players, using this value in contexts where overflow might occur
    should be considered carefully.
