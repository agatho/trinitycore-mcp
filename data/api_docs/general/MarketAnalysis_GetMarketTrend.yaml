api:
  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: GetMarketTrend
  signature: MarketTrend MarketAnalysis::GetMarketTrend(uint32 itemId, uint32 daysBack)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the market trend for a specified item over a given
    number of days.
  description: The GetMarketTrend method analyzes historical auction house data to
    determine the price movement pattern of a specific item within the last N days.
    It evaluates whether the item's price is increasing, decreasing, or stable based
    on average prices and transaction volumes during the specified period. This functionality
    is commonly used for in-game economic analysis, player decision-making regarding
    buying/selling strategies, and providing dynamic market insights to players through
    UI elements or game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to analyze. Must correspond to
      a valid entry in the game's item database.
  - name: daysBack
    description: The number of days in the past to consider for trend analysis. Valid
      range is typically 1-30 days, though implementation may vary.
  returns: 'Returns a MarketTrend enum value indicating the calculated market direction:
    UP_TREND if price is rising, DOWN_TREND if falling, or STABLE_TREND if no significant
    change occurred. Returns INVALID_TREND if the item has insufficient data for analysis.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MarketTrend trend = marketAnalysis->GetMarketTrend(18732, 7); // Analyze\
      \ health potion trend over last week\nif (trend == UP_TREND)\n    printf(\"\
      Price is rising!\");"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Trend Analysis
    code: "uint32 itemId = 12345;\nfor (int i = 1; i <= 30; ++i)\n{\n    MarketTrend\
      \ trend = marketAnalysis->GetMarketTrend(itemId, i);\n    switch(trend)\n  \
      \  {\n        case UP_TREND: printf(\"Rising trend %d days back\\n\", i); break;\n\
      \        case DOWN_TREND: printf(\"Falling trend %d days back\\n\", i); break;\n\
      \        case STABLE_TREND: printf(\"Stable trend %d days back\\n\", i); break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on stored auction house transaction data which may not
    be immediately updated. Performance can be impacted by large time ranges or items
    with very few transactions. The exact algorithm for calculating trends is implementation-specific
    and may include smoothing factors or volume-weighted averages.
  warnings: This method should not be called excessively in tight loops as it may
    query database tables multiple times. Ensure that itemId is validated before calling
    to prevent potential errors from invalid entries. Results may vary depending on
    server's auction house activity levels during the specified period.
