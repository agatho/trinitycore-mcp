  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: CalculateIndividualEffectiveness
  signature: float RoleOptimizer::CalculateIndividualEffectiveness(uint32 playerGuid,
    GroupRole role, const int & players)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the individual effectiveness of a player based on their role and
    group composition.
  description: The CalculateIndividualEffectiveness method determines how effectively
    a specific player contributes to their group's overall performance based on their
    assigned role and the current group composition. This calculation is used by the
    RoleOptimizer system to evaluate player performance, optimize role assignments,
    and ensure balanced group dynamics during raids or dungeons. The method takes
    into account various factors including the player's GUID, their assigned role
    within the group, and the total number of players in the group to compute a normalized
    effectiveness score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 represents maximum effectiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose effectiveness is
      being calculated. This value must correspond to a valid player in the current
      group or instance.
  - name: role
    description: The GroupRole enum value representing the player's assigned role
      within the group. Valid roles typically include TANK, HEALER, and DAMAGE.
  - name: players
    description: Reference to an integer representing the total number of players
      in the current group or instance. This parameter affects the calculation by
      providing context about group size and composition.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the calculated individual
    effectiveness of the player. A value of 1.0 indicates maximum effectiveness, while
    lower values indicate reduced contribution to group performance based on role
    assignment and group composition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 guid = 12345;

      GroupRole role = GroupRole::TANK;

      int playerCount = 5;

      float effectiveness = roleOptimizer.CalculateIndividualEffectiveness(guid, role,
      playerCount);

      // Returns a float value between 0.0 and 1.0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Optimization Example
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nGroupRole assignedRole\
      \ = player->GetRole();\nint groupSize = group->GetMembersCount();\nfloat effectiveness\
      \ = roleOptimizer.CalculateIndividualEffectiveness(playerGuid, assignedRole,\
      \ groupSize);\nif (effectiveness < 0.7f) {\n    // Consider reassigning player\
      \ to a different role\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated role optimization system and should
    only be called when the group composition is stable. The calculation may involve
    internal caching mechanisms that improve performance for repeated calls with similar
    parameters. The effectiveness score is influenced by game mechanics such as player
    specialization, gear level, and current encounter requirements.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters and will produce undefined behavior
    if playerGuid does not correspond to an active player or if players parameter
    is negative. The returned value should not be used for direct gameplay decisions
    without proper validation of group state.
