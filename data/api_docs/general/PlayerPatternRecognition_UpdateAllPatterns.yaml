  brief: Updates all pattern data for the player, recalculating and refreshing pattern
    recognition states.
  description: The UpdateAllPatterns method is responsible for refreshing and recalculating
    all pattern recognition data associated with a PlayerPatternRecognition instance.
    This method typically iterates through all known patterns and updates their state
    based on current player conditions, progress, or game events. It ensures that
    the player's pattern recognition system remains synchronized with the latest game
    state. The method may be triggered automatically during certain gameplay events
    or manually when pattern data needs to be refreshed. This is a core method for
    maintaining accurate pattern tracking within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerPatternRecognition* patternRec = player->GetPatternRecognition();

      patternRec->UpdateAllPatterns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications if called frequently during
    high-frequency gameplay events. It is recommended to batch pattern updates when
    possible rather than calling this method individually for each pattern.
