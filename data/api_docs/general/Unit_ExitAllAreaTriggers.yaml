  brief: Exits all area triggers associated with the unit
  description: This method removes the unit from all active area trigger contexts,
    effectively ending any ongoing area trigger interactions. It is typically used
    when a unit needs to be removed from an area trigger environment, such as when
    changing zones or during combat. The method ensures that all area trigger references
    are properly cleared and that no further trigger events occur for the unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetUnit();

      unit->ExitAllAreaTriggers();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may affect active area trigger
    mechanics. It is recommended to ensure that the unit is not in combat or actively
    engaged in any area trigger events before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may result in unexpected behavior
    or errors if the unit is still involved in active area trigger interactions.
