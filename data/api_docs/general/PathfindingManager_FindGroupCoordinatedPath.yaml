  class: PathfindingManager
  method: FindGroupCoordinatedPath
  signature: PathResult PathfindingManager::FindGroupCoordinatedPath(const int & goal,
    const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a coordinated movement path for a group of units toward
    a specified goal position.
  description: The FindGroupCoordinatedPath method computes a navigation path that
    allows multiple units within a group to move together in a coordinated manner
    towards a defined destination. This functionality is essential for group-based
    AI behaviors such as following a leader, forming formations, or executing complex
    tactical movements. The method takes into account the spatial relationships between
    group members and ensures that each unit follows an optimized route while maintaining
    group cohesion. It utilizes internal pathfinding algorithms to determine valid
    waypoints and avoids obstacles in the environment. The result is a structured
    path that can be consumed by the group's movement system to execute the coordinated
    motion.
  parameters:
  - name: goal
    description: The identifier or index representing the destination point for the
      group. This typically corresponds to a waypoint, NPC, or location in the game
      world that the group should navigate toward.
  - name: group
    description: The identifier of the group whose members will follow the computed
      path. This parameter references a specific group within the game's group management
      system and determines which units are included in the coordinated movement.
  returns: A PathResult object containing the computed path data for the group. The
    result includes waypoints, movement flags, and metadata that can be used to guide
    each member of the group along their individual paths while maintaining group
    coordination. Returns an invalid path if no valid route could be calculated or
    if the goal/group parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Pathfinding Usage
    code: "PathResult result = sPathfindingManager->FindGroupCoordinatedPath(100,\
      \ 5);\nif (result.IsValid()) {\n    // Process the path and assign it to group\
      \ members\n    for (auto& waypoint : result.GetWaypoints()) {\n        // Apply\
      \ movement logic per unit\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group Pathfinding with Error Handling
    code: "int goalId = 205;\nint groupId = 3;\nPathResult path = sPathfindingManager->FindGroupCoordinatedPath(goalId,\
      \ groupId);\nif (!path.IsValid()) {\n    // Handle pathfinding failure\n   \
      \ sLog->outError(\"Failed to compute coordinated path for group %d to goal %d\"\
      , groupId, goalId);\n} else {\n    // Proceed with group movement execution\n\
      \    sGroupMovementHandler->ExecuteGroupPath(groupId, path);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with group management systems
    and requires that both the goal and group identifiers are valid within the current
    game context. The implementation may cache or precompute certain path data to
    improve performance for frequently requested paths. It's recommended to call this
    method asynchronously during idle periods to avoid blocking gameplay threads.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid goal or group IDs can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the specified goal exists in the world and that
    the group is active before invoking this function. Additionally, repeated calls
    for the same group and goal without changes may return cached results, which might
    not reflect real-time environmental changes.
