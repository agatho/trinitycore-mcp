documentation:
  brief: Deploys the initial set of totems for a shaman AI-controlled unit.
  description: The DeployInitialTotems method is responsible for placing the shaman's
    initial totems at appropriate locations around the battlefield. This method typically
    gets called during the initialization phase of a shaman AI behavior, ensuring
    that the shaman has a proper totem setup before engaging in combat or performing
    other actions. The method may consider factors such as the shaman's current position,
    target location, and totem placement rules specific to the shaman's class abilities.
    It is part of the core AI logic for shaman units within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Shaman AI Initialization
    code: "void ShamanAI::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n \
      \   DeployInitialTotems(nullptr);\n    // Continue with other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked once during the AI initialization phase.
    It may interact with the shaman's totem placement system and should be called
    before any combat-related totem usage. The method does not take a target parameter
    in its signature, but it might internally determine the optimal totem positions
    based on the current state of the shaman unit.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when the shaman AI unit is properly
    initialized and has valid positioning data. Calling it before the unit's position
    is set may result in improper totem placement or undefined behavior.
