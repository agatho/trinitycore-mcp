  method: AnnouncementsOffAppend
  signature: void AnnouncementsOffAppend::AnnouncementsOffAppend(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player's GUID from the announcements off list, enabling announcements
    for that player.
  description: The AnnouncementsOffAppend method is used to remove a specified player's
    globally unique identifier (GUID) from a list of players who have disabled announcements.
    This allows the player to receive in-game announcements again after previously
    opting out. The method operates on a global or server-wide list and affects only
    the specific player identified by the GUID parameter. It is typically called when
    a player re-enables announcements through game interface options or commands.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose announcements
      status is being modified. This value must represent a valid online player in
      the server's session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Player from Announcements Off List
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player object exists

      AnnouncementsOffAppend::AnnouncementsOffAppend(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with a global container or set that tracks players
    who have disabled announcements. It should be called carefully to avoid unnecessary
    performance impact on server operations.
  warnings: Ensure the GUID parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual online
    player, otherwise the operation may silently fail or cause undefined behavior.
