  signature: BotAIConfig BotAITemplates::GetShamanTemplate(bool healer)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the configured AI template for shaman bots, optionally specifying
    whether it should be a healing template.
  description: The GetShamanTemplate method returns a BotAIConfig object that defines
    the behavior and decision-making logic for shaman bot characters within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method allows differentiation between healer and non-healer shaman
    templates, enabling the creation of specialized AI configurations tailored to
    specific roles. The returned configuration includes settings such as spell priorities,
    target selection criteria, and combat strategies specific to shaman class mechanics.
    This method is typically used during bot initialization or when switching between
    different shaman roles (healing vs. damage).
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotAIConfig object containing the complete AI configuration for shaman
    bots. The configuration includes spell usage patterns, target priorities, movement
    behaviors, and other class-specific AI parameters that define how the shaman bot
    will behave in various combat and non-combat scenarios.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Healing Shaman Template
    code: 'BotAIConfig healerTemplate = BotAITemplates::GetShamanTemplate(true);

      // Use healerTemplate to initialize a healing shaman bot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Retrieve Damage Shaman Template
    code: 'BotAIConfig damageTemplate = BotAITemplates::GetShamanTemplate(false);

      // Use damageTemplate to initialize a damage-dealing shaman bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches or pre-configures different shaman templates internally
    for performance reasons. The returned BotAIConfig object should not be modified
    directly as it may be shared across multiple bots. The method assumes that the
    TrinityCore environment has been properly initialized with shaman class data and
    AI configurations.
  warnings: Ensure that the TrinityCore server is running with proper bot support
    enabled before calling this method, as missing class configurations could result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. The returned BotAIConfig should not be stored
    permanently as it may be invalidated if AI templates are reloaded during runtime.
