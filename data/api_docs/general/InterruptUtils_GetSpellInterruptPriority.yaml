  method: GetSpellInterruptPriority
  signature: InterruptPriority InterruptUtils::GetSpellInterruptPriority(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the interrupt priority level of a specified spell for handling
    spell interruptions in World of Warcraft.
  description: The GetSpellInterruptPriority method retrieves the interrupt priority
    value associated with a given spell ID. This priority level is used by the game's
    spell interruption system to determine whether one spell can interrupt another,
    particularly during combat. Higher priority spells can interrupt lower priority
    ones, and this mechanism helps maintain proper spell behavior and game balance.
    The method accesses internal spell data tables to look up the defined interrupt
    priority for the specified spell ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an InterruptPriority enum value indicating the spell's interrupt
    priority level. Possible values typically include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or VERY_HIGH,
    though exact values depend on the internal implementation and spell definitions
    in the TrinityCore database.
  examples:
  - title: Check interrupt priority of a spell
    code: "uint32 spellId = 12345;\nInterruptPriority priority = InterruptUtils::GetSpellInterruptPriority(spellId);\n\
      if (priority == InterruptPriority::HIGH)\n{\n    // Handle high-priority spell\
      \ interruption logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell data tables that must be properly populated
    in the TrinityCore database. The implementation likely uses cached lookup tables
    for performance reasons, as this method may be called frequently during combat
    scenarios. Developers should ensure that spell IDs passed to this method correspond
    to valid spells defined in the game's database.
  warnings: Passing invalid or undefined spell IDs to this method may result in unexpected
    behavior or default priority values. Since this is part of the core interrupt
    system, incorrect priority assignments could lead to gameplay balance issues or
    unintended spell interactions.
