  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: LoadBotProfile
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::LoadBotProfile(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Loads a bot profile for AI decision profiling based on the provided bot GUID.
  description: The LoadBotProfile method initializes or retrieves a specific bot's
    profiling data within the AIDecisionProfiler system. This function is typically
    used to prepare the profiler for analyzing decisions made by a particular bot
    character, identified by its unique Game Object ID (GUID). It ensures that all
    subsequent AI decision logging and analysis will be associated with the specified
    bot. The method likely performs internal setup such as allocating memory, initializing
    tracking variables, or loading pre-configured settings related to the bot's behavior
    patterns. This is essential for debugging and optimizing AI performance in TrinityCore-based
    World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character whose profile needs
      to be loaded for AI decision profiling. Must be a valid GameObject GUID used
      within the TrinityCore server environment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      profiler.LoadBotProfile(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any AI decision logging or profiling
    operations for the specified bot. Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds
    to an existing bot in the world to avoid undefined behavior.
