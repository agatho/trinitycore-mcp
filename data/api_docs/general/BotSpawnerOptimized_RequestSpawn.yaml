documentation:
  brief: Initiates a bot spawning request with the provided spawn configuration
  description: The RequestSpawn method is responsible for processing a bot spawning
    request within the TrinityCore framework. It validates the incoming spawn request
    and attempts to create the specified bot(s) in the game world. This method integrates
    with the bot management system to ensure proper initialization, positioning, and
    registration of newly spawned bots. The method returns true if the spawning process
    was successfully initiated, or false if the request failed due to validation errors,
    resource limitations, or other constraints. This functionality is typically used
    by the bot AI system or administrative tools to dynamically add bots to the game
    world.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: A constant reference to a SpawnRequest object containing all necessary
      parameters for bot spawning including bot type, position, faction, and other
      configuration options
  returns: True if the spawn request was successfully processed and the bot(s) were
    initiated for spawning, false if the request failed due to validation errors,
    insufficient resources, or other processing failures
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spawn Request
    code: "SpawnRequest request;\nrequest.botType = BOT_TYPE_WARRIOR;\nrequest.position\
      \ = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f);\nrequest.faction = FACTION_ALLIANCE;\n\
      \nBotSpawnerOptimized spawner;\nbool success = spawner.RequestSpawn(request);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Bot spawning initiated successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      bot\", \"Bot spawn request processed successfully\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ spawn failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to process bot spawn request\"\
      );\n}"

  notes: This method operates within the context of TrinityCore's bot management system
    and requires proper initialization of the bot spawner component. The actual spawning
    may be asynchronous, so the return value only indicates request processing success,
    not completion. The method performs validation on the spawn request parameters
    to prevent invalid configurations from being processed.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initializing the BotSpawnerOptimized
    component may result in undefined behavior. The method does not guarantee that
    bots will successfully spawn in the game world - it only initiates the spawning
    process. Multiple rapid calls to this method without proper rate limiting may
    cause performance issues or resource contention.
