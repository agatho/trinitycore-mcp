  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: InitializeInstanceCoordination
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::InitializeInstanceCoordination(Group * group,
    Map * instanceMap)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes instance coordination for a group within a specific map instance.
  description: The InitializeInstanceCoordination method sets up the necessary coordination
    mechanisms for a group to properly function within a World of Warcraft instance
    map. This includes establishing group membership, tracking instance-specific data,
    and preparing the group for instance-related operations such as loot distribution,
    encounter management, and instance exit procedures. The method ensures that all
    group members are correctly registered with the instance map's coordination system
    and that their instance-specific states are initialized appropriately. It typically
    gets called when a group enters an instance map for the first time or when instance
    coordination needs to be reset.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group entering
      the instance. Must not be null and should represent a valid group with at least
      one member.
  - name: instanceMap
    description: Pointer to the Map object representing the instance map where the
      group is entering. Must not be null and should be a valid instance map (not
      a regular world map).
  returns: None. This method performs initialization operations and does not return
    any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Instance Coordination Initialization
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nMap* instanceMap = player->GetMap();\n\
      if (group && instanceMap && instanceMap->IsDungeon()) {\n    sInstanceCoordination->InitializeInstanceCoordination(group,\
      \ instanceMap);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Coordination for Raid Instance
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nMap* raidMap = player->GetMap();\n\
      if (raidGroup && raidMap && raidMap->IsRaid()) {\n    sInstanceCoordination->InitializeInstanceCoordination(raidGroup,\
      \ raidMap);\n    // Additional raid-specific setup can follow\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore instance management
    system when a group enters an instance. Developers should not call this method
    directly unless implementing custom instance coordination logic. The method assumes
    that the provided group and map parameters are valid and properly initialized.
    It may perform internal checks to ensure that the group members are actually present
    in the map before proceeding with coordination setup.
  warnings: Calling this method with null parameters will likely result in crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that both the group and instanceMap parameters are
    valid before calling this method. This method should only be called when a group
    is entering an actual instance, not during regular world gameplay.
