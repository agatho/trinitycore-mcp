  method: RemovePlayerFromMap
  signature: void BattlegroundMap::RemovePlayerFromMap(Player * param0, bool param1)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the battleground map, handling cleanup and state updates.
  description: The RemovePlayerFromMap method is responsible for removing a player
    from a battleground map. This includes updating internal tracking structures,
    notifying the player's session, and ensuring proper cleanup of battleground-related
    data. The method typically gets invoked when a player leaves a battleground, either
    by exiting the map, disconnecting, or being removed due to game rules. It ensures
    that the player's presence is properly removed from the battleground's active
    state and that any associated resources are freed up appropriately.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object that needs to be removed from the battleground
      map.
  - name: param1
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player should be removed from
      the battleground's internal tracking structures. If true, the player is fully
      removed; if false, only partial cleanup may occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BattlegroundMap* bgMap = ...;

      Player* player = ...;

      bgMap->RemovePlayerFromMap(player, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Removal
    code: "if (player->GetBattlegroundId() != 0)\n{\n    BattlegroundMap* bgMap =\
      \ static_cast<BattlegroundMap*>(player->GetMap());\n    bgMap->RemovePlayerFromMap(player,\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the battleground system and
    should not be invoked directly unless handling special edge cases. It assumes
    that the player is already in a valid battleground context and that appropriate
    checks have been performed before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the player is actually on the battleground
    map may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify the player's presence
    in the battleground before invoking this method.
