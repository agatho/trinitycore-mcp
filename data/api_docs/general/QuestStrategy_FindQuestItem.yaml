  class: QuestStrategy
  method: FindQuestItem
  signature: int * QuestStrategy::FindQuestItem(BotAI * ai, const int & objective)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a pointer to the quest item identifier matching the specified
    objective.
  description: The FindQuestItem method is used within the TrinityCore AI framework
    to locate a specific quest item based on an objective identifier. It searches
    through the bot's inventory and quest-related data structures to identify items
    that are associated with a given quest objective. This method is typically invoked
    during quest progression logic where the AI needs to determine if a required item
    for a quest objective has been acquired or is available. The returned pointer
    points to an integer representing the item's identifier, which can then be used
    for further processing such as item validation, quest completion checks, or interaction
    with the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that contains the bot's current state
      and quest data. This parameter is essential for accessing the bot's inventory
      and quest information.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to an integer representing the quest objective identifier.
      This value corresponds to a specific quest requirement or task within the game's
      quest system.
  returns: Pointer to an integer that represents the item identifier associated with
    the specified quest objective. Returns NULL if no matching quest item is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest progression
    code: "int* itemId = strategy->FindQuestItem(ai, 12345);\nif (itemId != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with quest item validation\n    printf(\"Found quest item\
      \ ID: %d\\n\", *itemId);\n} else {\n    // Handle case where quest item is not\
      \ found\n    printf(\"No quest item found for objective 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using returned pointer for item validation
    code: "int* questItem = strategy->FindQuestItem(ai, currentObjective);\nif (questItem\
      \ != nullptr && *questItem > 0) {\n    // Validate that the bot has the required\
      \ item\n    Item* item = ai->GetBot()->GetItemByEntry(*questItem);\n    if (item)\
      \ {\n        // Item exists in inventory\n        ai->DoQuestComplete(*questItem);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest handling system and relies on accurate
    mapping between quest objectives and item identifiers. The returned pointer should
    be checked for NULL before dereferencing to avoid segmentation faults. Performance
    may vary depending on the number of active quests and items in the bot's inventory.
  warnings: Ensure that the objective parameter is a valid quest objective ID; otherwise,
    the method may return unexpected results or NULL. Avoid storing the returned pointer
    beyond the scope of its validity as it may point to temporary data structures.
