  class: ObjectMgr
  method: GetGameTele
  signature: const GameTele * ObjectMgr::GetGameTele(std::string_view name) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GameTele structure for a specified teleport location name.
  description: The GetGameTele method searches through the internal database of game
    teleport locations and returns a pointer to the corresponding GameTele structure
    if found. This method is used primarily for handling player teleportation commands
    and location lookups within the game world. The returned pointer is valid only
    as long as the ObjectMgr instance remains active and the teleport location data
    has not been modified or cleared. If no matching teleport location is found, the
    method returns a null pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a GameTele structure representing the teleport location
    if found; otherwise, nullptr if no matching location exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetGameTele
    code: "const GameTele* tele = sObjectMgr->GetGameTele(\"Ironforge\");\nif (tele)\n\
      {\n    // Teleport player to Ironforge\n    player->TeleportTo(tele->mapId,\
      \ tele->x, tele->y, tele->z, tele->orientation);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in an internal map structure that is populated
    during server startup from the game_tele table. The method is thread-safe for
    read operations as long as no concurrent modifications occur to the underlying
    data structure.
  warnings: The returned pointer must not be stored or used after the ObjectMgr instance
    has been destroyed or if the teleport location data has been modified. Also, this
    method does not validate whether the returned coordinates are valid for actual
    teleportation; it only retrieves the stored data.
