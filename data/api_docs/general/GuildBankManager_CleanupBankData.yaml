  brief: Removes invalid or corrupted guild bank data entries from the database.
  description: The CleanupBankData method is responsible for identifying and removing
    invalid, corrupted, or orphaned entries from the guild bank storage system. This
    includes cleaning up items that no longer exist in the game database, entries
    with invalid item IDs, or records that reference non-existent guilds or players.
    The method ensures data integrity within the guild bank system by performing validation
    checks on all stored bank items and removing any that do not meet current game
    requirements. It is typically invoked during server maintenance or when corruption
    is detected in the guild bank database tables.

  notes: This method performs database operations and may cause temporary performance
    degradation during execution. It should typically be called during low-traffic
    periods or server maintenance windows to minimize impact on players.
  warnings: Calling this method while guild bank transactions are actively occurring
    may result in data inconsistencies or loss of recent transactions. It is recommended
    to pause all guild bank activities before invoking this cleanup routine.
