  class: PathfindingManager
  method: GenerateWaypoints
  signature: int PathfindingManager::GenerateWaypoints(const int & start, const int
    & goal, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a set of waypoints between a start and goal position for pathfinding
    purposes.
  description: The GenerateWaypoints method computes a sequence of navigable points
    (waypoints) from a starting location to a destination in the game world. This
    method is typically used by AI-controlled creatures or NPCs to navigate through
    terrain, avoiding obstacles and following valid paths. The generated waypoints
    can be used for movement execution, path validation, or debugging purposes. It
    requires valid start and goal positions that are within the bounds of the current
    map and are navigable. The method returns a count indicating how many waypoints
    were successfully generated.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting position identifier or index for pathfinding. This value
      must correspond to a valid node or point in the navigation mesh.
  - name: goal
    description: The destination position identifier or index for pathfinding. This
      value must correspond to a valid node or point in the navigation mesh.
  - name: count
    description: The maximum number of waypoints to generate. If set to 0, the method
      may return all available waypoints up to internal limits.
  returns: An integer representing the number of waypoints successfully generated.
    A negative value typically indicates an error or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Waypoint Generation
    code: "int waypoints = pathfindingManager.GenerateWaypoints(100, 200, 10);\nif\
      \ (waypoints > 0) {\n    // Process generated waypoints\n    std::cout << \"\
      Generated \" << waypoints << \" waypoints.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle error case\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to generate waypoints.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Full Path for NPC Movement
    code: "uint32 maxWaypoints = 50;\nint generated = pathfindingManager.GenerateWaypoints(npc->GetSpawnPosition(),\
      \ player->GetPosition(), maxWaypoints);\nif (generated > 0) {\n    // Move NPC\
      \ along the generated waypoints\n    for (int i = 0; i < generated; ++i) {\n\
      \        // Apply movement logic using waypoint[i]\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh and requires that both
    start and goal positions are valid within the current map context. The pathfinding
    algorithm may vary based on the implementation (e.g., A*), but generally aims
    to find a navigable route while respecting terrain constraints.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or out-of-bounds start/goal indices can
    result in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that positions are validated before
    calling this function, especially when dealing with dynamic world objects whose
    locations might change frequently.
