documentation:
  brief: Clears all selected Azerite powers from the item.
  description: The ClearSelectedAzeritePowers method removes all currently selected
    Azerite powers from an Azerite empowered item. This operation resets the item's
    Azerite power selection state, effectively clearing any previously chosen abilities
    or effects that were applied to the item through the Azerite trait system. The
    method is typically invoked when an item needs to be reconfigured or when resetting
    the Azerite powers to their default state. It does not affect the item's Azerite
    level or the available traits; it only clears the currently selected ones.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Azerite Powers on an Item
    code: "AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);\nif (item)\n\
      {\n    item->ClearSelectedAzeritePowers();\n    // All previously selected Azerite\
      \ powers are now cleared\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other Azerite-related operations
    such as setting new Azerite powers or resetting an item's Azerite state. It may
    trigger UI updates to reflect the cleared selections.
