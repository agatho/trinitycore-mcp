  method: _SendBankContentUpdate
  signature: void Guild::_SendBankContentUpdate(uint8 tabId, int slots) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends an update packet to all guild members notifying them of changes to
    the bank tab content.
  description: The _SendBankContentUpdate method is a private helper function within
    the Guild class that broadcasts a packet to all online guild members, informing
    them about modifications made to a specific bank tab's contents. This method ensures
    that players see the most up-to-date information when they interact with their
    guild bank, such as when items are deposited, withdrawn, or moved between slots.
    The function takes a tab identifier and the number of slots affected by the update,
    allowing for targeted updates rather than full refreshes. It is typically invoked
    internally by other guild bank-related methods when changes occur.
  parameters:
  - name: tabId
    description: The index of the bank tab being updated (0-based). Valid values are
      typically between 0 and the maximum number of tabs allowed for the guild's bank
      configuration.
  - name: slots
    description: The number of slots that have been modified in the specified bank
      tab. A negative value may indicate removals or clearing of slots, while a positive
      value indicates additions or updates to existing slots.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating a single slot in a guild bank tab
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      guild->_SendBankContentUpdate(0, 1); // Update first tab with one modified slot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing multiple slots from a guild bank tab
    code: 'Guild* guild = ...;

      guild->_SendBankContentUpdate(2, -5); // Clear five slots in third tab'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is internal and should not be called directly from outside the
    Guild class. It relies on the underlying TrinityCore packet system to send updates
    efficiently. Performance-wise, it only sends updates to players currently online
    and connected to the server.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid tabId values or incorrect slot counts
    may result in client-side errors or inconsistent UI states for guild members.
    Ensure that any external calls to related bank functions properly validate parameters
    before invoking this internal update mechanism.
