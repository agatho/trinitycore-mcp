  class: SmartAI
  method: ReceiveEmote
  signature: void SmartAI::ReceiveEmote(Player * player, uint32 textEmote)
documentation:
  brief: Processes emote events received from players in SmartAI.
  description: The ReceiveEmote method is a callback function within the SmartAI class
    that handles emote interactions initiated by players. When a player performs an
    emote near a creature controlled by SmartAI, this method is invoked to process
    the emote event. It typically checks the emote type and may trigger specific AI
    behaviors or responses based on predefined conditions. This method plays a crucial
    role in enabling interactive NPC behavior and quest-related emote triggers within
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who initiated the emote. This parameter
      represents the player character performing the emote action.
  - name: textEmote
    description: The emote ID (uint32) representing the specific emote type performed
      by the player. This value corresponds to the TextEmote table in the database
      and defines the visual and auditory effects of the emote.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic emote handling
    code: "void SmartAI::ReceiveEmote(Player* player, uint32 textEmote)\n{\n    if\
      \ (textEmote == TEXT_EMOTE_SALUTE)\n    {\n        // Perform specific action\
      \ when player salutes\n        Talk(0);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional emote response
    code: "void SmartAI::ReceiveEmote(Player* player, uint32 textEmote)\n{\n    switch\
      \ (textEmote)\n    {\n        case TEXT_EMOTE_WAVE:\n            if (player->HasQuest(QUEST_ID))\n\
      \                player->AreaExploredOrEventHappens(QUEST_ID);\n           \
      \ break;\n        case TEXT_EMOTE_BOW:\n            // Trigger quest completion\
      \ or dialogue\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI system which allows for advanced AI behaviors
    in creatures. The method is typically called from the core's event handling system
    when a player performs an emote near an NPC. Developers should ensure that emote
    IDs used are valid and correspond to actual entries in the TextEmote database
    table.
  warnings: Improper handling of emote events may lead to unexpected AI behavior or
    quest progression issues. Ensure that all emote IDs referenced exist in the database,
    and be cautious when modifying AI logic based on emotes as it can affect player
    experience and quest mechanics.
