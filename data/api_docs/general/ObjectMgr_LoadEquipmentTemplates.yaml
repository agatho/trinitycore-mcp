documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes equipment templates for creatures and game objects
    from the database.
  description: The LoadEquipmentTemplates method is responsible for loading all creature
    and game object equipment templates from the database into memory. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when reloading configuration data.
    It processes the data stored in the 'creature_template_equipment' table and other
    related tables, associating equipment sets with specific creature entries. These
    templates define what items (weapons, armor, etc.) creatures should be equipped
    with when spawned. The method ensures that all equipment definitions are properly
    cached for fast lookup during runtime, improving performance by avoiding repeated
    database queries for the same equipment data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadCustomData()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadEquipmentTemplates();\n\
      \    // Equipment templates are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup sequence before any
    creatures are spawned. It's important to note that this method does not validate
    the equipment items against the item template database - it simply loads what's
    in the equipment template tables. The loaded templates are stored in internal
    caches for fast access during creature spawning.
  warnings: Calling this method after the server has started and creatures are already
    spawned may lead to inconsistent behavior or require additional synchronization
    logic. This method should only be called during initialization or reload operations,
    not during active gameplay.
