  class: MovementArbiter
  method: SetDiagnosticLogging
  signature: void MovementArbiter::SetDiagnosticLogging(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables diagnostic logging for movement arbiter operations.
  description: The SetDiagnosticLogging method controls whether detailed diagnostic
    information about movement arbiter activities is recorded. This functionality
    is typically used for debugging and performance analysis during development or
    troubleshooting. When enabled, the movement arbiter will log various events such
    as pathfinding attempts, movement updates, and potential issues with unit positioning.
    The logging can help developers identify movement-related problems, optimize AI
    behavior, or understand why certain units are not moving as expected. This method
    does not affect gameplay in any way; it only controls logging verbosity.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether diagnostic logging should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Diagnostic Logging
    code: 'MovementArbiter* arbiter = ...;

      arbiter->SetDiagnosticLogging(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Diagnostic Logging
    code: 'MovementArbiter* arbiter = ...;

      arbiter->SetDiagnosticLogging(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for developers and debugging purposes.
    Enabling diagnostic logging may impact performance in high-traffic scenarios due
    to the additional overhead of logging operations. The actual log output depends
    on the underlying logging system configuration and verbosity levels set elsewhere
    in the TrinityCore codebase.
