documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet for non-moderator users.
  description: The NotModeratorAppend::Append method is responsible for populating
    a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet with relevant data specific to non-moderator
    users in the context of World of Warcraft's channel system. This method likely
    handles the construction of notification messages that are sent to players who
    are not channel moderators, ensuring they receive appropriate updates about channel
    events such as joins, leaves, or other user actions. The method operates on a
    const object and modifies the provided packet parameter in-place. It is part of
    TrinityCore's internal handling of channel communications and ensures proper message
    formatting for client-side display.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet that
      will be populated with notification data specific to non-moderator users.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of NotModeratorAppend::Append
    code: 'NotModeratorAppend appendHandler;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      appendHandler.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during channel-related operations within
    TrinityCore's server logic. It assumes that the provided packet object has been
    properly initialized and is ready to receive data. The implementation likely involves
    setting specific fields in the packet that are relevant only to non-moderator
    users, such as permissions or access levels.
