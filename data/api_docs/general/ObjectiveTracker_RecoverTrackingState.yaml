  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: RecoverTrackingState
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::RecoverTrackingState(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Restores the tracking state for a specified quest to the player's objective
    tracker.
  description: The RecoverTrackingState method is used to restore a previously tracked
    quest's state back onto the player's objective tracker. This functionality is
    typically invoked when a bot or player re-enters a zone where they had previously
    been tracking a quest, ensuring that the quest objectives are properly displayed
    and synchronized with the current game state. The method takes a reference to
    a Player object and a quest ID, and it ensures that any tracked objectives associated
    with that quest are reinstated in the tracker. This is particularly useful for
    maintaining quest progress visibility across zone transitions or when restoring
    bot states.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose objective tracker state will be
      recovered. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which tracking state should
      be restored. Must correspond to a valid tracked quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recover tracking state for a specific quest
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      ObjectiveTracker::RecoverTrackingState(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal tracking system of the ObjectiveTracker
    class to re-enable or refresh quest objectives. It may involve checking if the
    quest is still active and valid in the current context before restoring its state.
