documentation:
  brief: Processes officer duties for a player within the guild integration system
  description: The HandleOfficerDuties method manages the administrative responsibilities
    and permissions assigned to guild officers. This function likely validates officer
    status, processes duty-related actions such as managing guild members, setting
    guild properties, or handling officer-specific commands. It operates within the
    TrinityCore framework's guild management system and interacts with player data
    to ensure proper officer privileges are maintained. The method may also handle
    synchronization of officer duties across the game world and update relevant guild
    state information.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) who
      is performing officer duties. This parameter specifies which player's officer
      status and permissions are being processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Officer Duty Processing
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.HandleOfficerDuties(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Officer Duty with Validation
    code: "int* playerId = new int(67890);\nif (playerId != nullptr)\n{\n    GuildIntegration\
      \ guildInt;\n    guildInt.HandleOfficerDuties(playerId);\n}\ndelete playerId;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with TrinityCore's internal guild management
    structures and may require the player to be authenticated and have valid officer
    permissions. The implementation might involve database operations or communication
    with other subsystems to maintain consistency of officer duties across the server.
  warnings: The parameter 'player' must point to a valid integer identifier; passing
    null or invalid pointers could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper
    validation before calling this method in production code.
