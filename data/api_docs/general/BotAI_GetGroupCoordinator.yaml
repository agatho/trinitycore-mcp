  class: BotAI

  signature: const GroupCoordinator * BotAI::GetGroupCoordinator() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the GroupCoordinator instance managing group-related
    AI behavior for this bot.
  description: The GetGroupCoordinator method retrieves the GroupCoordinator object
    associated with this BotAI instance. The GroupCoordinator is responsible for handling
    group-related decisions and coordination logic within the AI system, such as determining
    when to form groups, manage group roles, or handle group-specific actions. This
    method provides access to the coordinator that governs how the bot interacts with
    other bots or players in a group context. The returned pointer is const-qualified,
    indicating that the caller should not modify the GroupCoordinator through this
    interface. The method does not perform any validation or initialization of the
    coordinator; it simply returns the stored reference if one exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the GroupCoordinator instance associated with this BotAI,
    or nullptr if no group coordinator has been assigned yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const GroupCoordinator* coordinator = botAI->GetGroupCoordinator();\nif\
      \ (coordinator != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the coordinator for group-related\
      \ logic\n    coordinator->UpdateGroupBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Group Coordinator Existence
    code: "const GroupCoordinator* coord = botAI->GetGroupCoordinator();\nif (coord)\n\
      {\n    // Safe to use coordinator\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"Bot has group coordinator:\
      \ {}\", coord->GetGroupId());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No group coordinator assigned\n\
      \    LOG_DEBUG(\"Bot has no group coordinator assigned.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the BotAI system to access group
    coordination logic. The returned GroupCoordinator pointer should not be deleted
    or modified directly, as it's managed by the AI system. If this method returns
    nullptr, it indicates that no group coordinator has been initialized for this
    bot yet.
  warnings: Do not attempt to delete or modify the returned GroupCoordinator pointer.
    Accessing a null return value without checking can lead to undefined behavior.
    This method may return nullptr if called before the BotAI has been properly initialized
    with a group context.
