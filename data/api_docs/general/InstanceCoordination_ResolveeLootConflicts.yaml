  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: ResolveeLootConflicts
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::ResolveeLootConflicts(Group * group, uint32
    itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves loot conflicts within a group for a specific item.
  description: The ResolveeLootConflicts method handles the resolution of conflicting
    loot assignments among group members when multiple players have expressed interest
    in the same item. This method ensures fair distribution of loot by managing scenarios
    where several group members may have rolled or been awarded the same item, typically
    during group loot distribution. It operates within the context of World of Warcraft's
    instance coordination system and is part of the TrinityCore server implementation.
    The method processes the group's loot settings and determines how to distribute
    the item among eligible participants.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players involved in the
      loot conflict resolution. Must be a valid group with members who have rolled
      on the item.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which loot conflicts need to
      be resolved. This ID corresponds to an entry in the game's item database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 itemId = 12345;

      instanceCoordination->ResolveeLootConflicts(myGroup, itemId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during group loot distribution processes
    when multiple players have rolled on the same item. It assumes that the group
    has already performed necessary rolling or awarding operations before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing an invalid group could lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    in the server.
