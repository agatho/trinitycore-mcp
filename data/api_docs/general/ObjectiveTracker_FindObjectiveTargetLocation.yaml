  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: FindObjectiveTargetLocation
  signature: int ObjectiveTracker::FindObjectiveTargetLocation(Player * bot, const
    QuestObjectiveData & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the location of a quest objective target for the specified
    player bot.
  description: The FindObjectiveTargetLocation method is used to determine the geographic
    coordinates or entity reference of a specific quest objective target associated
    with a given player bot. This method is typically invoked during automated quest
    progression or quest tracking logic within the TrinityCore framework. It processes
    the provided quest objective data and attempts to locate the relevant target,
    which could be a creature, game object, or item required for quest completion.
    The method returns an integer identifier that represents the found location or
    target, with specific values indicating success, failure, or special conditions
    such as invalid objectives or missing target data.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the objective
      target location is being searched. This parameter must not be null and should
      represent a valid player instance within the game world.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific quest objective whose target location needs to be found.
      This includes details such as objective type, target ID, and associated quest
      data.
  returns: 'An integer value representing the outcome of the search operation:

    - Returns a positive integer if the target location is successfully identified.

    - Returns zero or negative values to indicate failure conditions such as invalid
    objective data, missing targets, or internal errors.

    - Specific return codes may vary based on implementation details within TrinityCore''s
    quest tracking system.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized player bot\nQuestObjectiveData\
      \ objective = ...; // Assume populated objective data\nint locationId = ObjectiveTracker::FindObjectiveTargetLocation(bot,\
      \ objective);\nif (locationId > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with navigation or interaction\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"Found target at location ID: %d\\n\", locationId);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Handle failure case\n    printf(\"Failed to find objective target.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Tracking System
    code: "void ProcessQuestObjective(Player* bot, uint32 questId)\n{\n    Quest const*\
      \ quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(questId);\n    if (!quest) return;\n\n\
      \    for (uint8 i = 0; i < QUEST_OBJECTIVES_COUNT; ++i)\n    {\n        if (quest->ObjectiveType[i]\
      \ == QUEST_OBJECTIVE_TYPE_NONE) continue;\n\n        QuestObjectiveData objective;\n\
      \        // Populate objective data from quest template\n        int targetLocation\
      \ = ObjectiveTracker::FindObjectiveTargetLocation(bot, objective);\n       \
      \ if (targetLocation > 0)\n        {\n            // Use targetLocation for\
      \ pathfinding or interaction\n            bot->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(targetLocation,\
      \ /* coordinates */);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest tracking system and may be subject
    to changes in future versions of TrinityCore. The exact meaning of returned integer
    values depends on the implementation details of the objective tracker and how
    it maps objectives to world locations or entities. Developers should ensure that
    the provided Player object and QuestObjectiveData are valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null parameters can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that both 'bot' and 'objective' parameters are properly
    initialized and valid. The method may not handle all edge cases gracefully, so
    error checking around return values is recommended.
