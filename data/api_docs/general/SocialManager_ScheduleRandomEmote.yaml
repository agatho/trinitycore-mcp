documentation:
  brief: Schedules a random emote to be displayed by the player at a later time.
  description: The ScheduleRandomEmote method is used to queue a random emote for
    display on the player character. This function typically integrates with the game's
    social system and may be triggered based on various conditions such as player
    activity, time intervals, or interaction events. The actual emote execution occurs
    asynchronously after the scheduling is completed. This method does not directly
    send the emote to other players but rather prepares it for future display within
    the client.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: player->GetSocialManager()->ScheduleRandomEmote();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger social interaction system and may
    be called internally by the server or triggered by external events. It's important
    to note that emotes are not immediately sent; they are scheduled for later execution.
