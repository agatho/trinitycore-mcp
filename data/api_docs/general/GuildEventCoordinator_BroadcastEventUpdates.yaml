  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::BroadcastEventUpdates(uint32 eventId, const
    std::string & updateMessage)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a broadcast message to all guild members regarding a specific event
    update.
  description: The BroadcastEventUpdates method is responsible for disseminating event-related
    information to all members of a guild. It takes an event identifier and a formatted
    message string, then distributes this information across the guild's communication
    channels. This functionality is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to notify players about changes or updates to guild events such as raids,
    social gatherings, or other organized activities. The method ensures that all
    online and offline guild members receive the update according to the server's
    messaging system.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier for the guild event being updated. This ID corresponds
      to a specific event in the guild's event management system.
  - name: updateMessage
    description: Formatted string containing the update information to be broadcasted
      to all guild members. The message should be concise and informative about the
      event changes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a raid schedule update
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.BroadcastEventUpdates(12345, "Raid scheduled for tomorrow at 8 PM.
      New loot rules applied.");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending an event cancellation notice
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.BroadcastEventUpdates(67890, "Guild meeting cancelled due to low
      attendance.");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the existing guild communication infrastructure and
    may involve asynchronous message handling. It should be called only when event
    updates are confirmed to avoid unnecessary network traffic.
  warnings: Ensure that eventId is valid and corresponds to an actual guild event,
    otherwise the broadcast might not reach intended recipients. Avoid sending excessive
    updates which could overwhelm players with notifications.
