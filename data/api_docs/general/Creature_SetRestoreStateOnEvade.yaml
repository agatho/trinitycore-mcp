documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature should restore its state when evading from combat.
  description: This method controls whether a creature will automatically restore
    its original state (such as health, position, and AI state) when it evades from
    combat. When enabled, the creature will return to its initial state upon evading,
    rather than maintaining its current state. This is particularly useful for creatures
    that should reset their behavior after combat ends.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetRestoreStateOnEvade(true);

      // Creature will now restore state on evading'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects how the creature's AI behavior is handled during evading.
    The implementation relies on internal state tracking mechanisms that ensure proper
    restoration of the creature's original state upon evading.
  warnings: Improper use may lead to unexpected behavior in creature AI, especially
    if used without understanding the underlying evading mechanics. Always ensure
    that this setting aligns with intended game design.
