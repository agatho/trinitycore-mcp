documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell has a persistent death effect
  description: This method checks if a spell has a death persistent effect, meaning
    the spell will continue to apply effects even after the target has died. It is
    commonly used in spell mechanics to identify spells that maintain their effects
    on dead targets or have special handling for death-related states. The method
    returns true when the spell's effect persists through death, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for understanding how certain spells behave in combat
    situations where targets may die during spell execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell has a persistent death effect, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the spell's effects continue to apply even after the target
    dies.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsDeathPersistent()) {\n    // Handle death persistent spell\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks the spell''s effect flags
    or properties in the database. Performance considerations: No significant overhead
    as this is a simple boolean check. Thread safety: This method is thread-safe as
    it only reads immutable data from SpellInfo.'
  warnings: 'This method should not be confused with other death-related methods;
    it specifically checks for persistent death effects rather than death state itself.
    Common mistake: Using this method to determine if a spell causes death, rather
    than if it persists through death.'
