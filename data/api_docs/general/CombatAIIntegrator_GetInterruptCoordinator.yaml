  method: GetInterruptCoordinator
  signature: InterruptCoordinator * CombatAIIntegrator::GetInterruptCoordinator()
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interrupt coordinator instance used for managing spell interruption
    logic within combat AI.
  description: The GetInterruptCoordinator method returns a pointer to the InterruptCoordinator
    object associated with this CombatAIIntegrator. This coordinator is responsible
    for handling spell interruption mechanics during combat, including tracking which
    spells can be interrupted and managing the conditions under which interruptions
    occur. The returned pointer is typically valid throughout the lifetime of the
    CombatAIIntegrator instance, but callers should verify the pointer is not null
    before use. This method provides access to core interrupt-related functionality
    that governs how NPCs respond to spell interruption events such as being hit by
    damage or receiving specific abilities that break spellcasting.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the InterruptCoordinator instance used by this CombatAIIntegrator.
    Returns nullptr if no coordinator has been initialized or if the object is in
    an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "InterruptCoordinator* coordinator = combatAI->GetInterruptCoordinator();\n\
      if (coordinator != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the interrupt coordinator for spell\
      \ interruption logic\n    coordinator->HandleSpellInterrupt(unit, spellInfo);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat AI
    code: "class MyCombatAI : public CombatAIIntegrator\n{\npublic:\n    void OnSpellCast(Spell*\
      \ spell) override\n    {\n        InterruptCoordinator* coord = GetInterruptCoordinator();\n\
      \        if (coord && coord->CanInterruptSpell(spell))\n        {\n        \
      \    // Handle interruption logic\n            coord->ProcessInterrupt(spell);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The InterruptCoordinator returned by this method is typically initialized
    during the CombatAIIntegrator's construction or first use. This method does not
    perform any locking or synchronization internally, so if used from multiple threads,
    external synchronization may be required. The pointer should be treated as read-only
    and not modified directly.
  warnings: Never assume the returned pointer is non-null without checking. Accessing
    a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, do not store the
    returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the CombatAIIntegrator instance, as it
    may become invalid if the integrator is destroyed or reinitialized.
