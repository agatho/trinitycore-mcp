documentation:
  brief: Calculates the time remaining until a projectile impacts its target
  description: The TimeToImpact method computes the number of milliseconds remaining
    before a projectile reaches its destination based on the current game time. This
    method is typically used in projectile-based spell and ability systems to determine
    when damage should be applied or effects should trigger. The calculation takes
    into account the projectile's speed, distance to target, and the provided current
    time value. This method is essential for synchronizing projectile animations,
    damage application, and visual effects with the game's timing system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of milliseconds until the
    projectile impacts its target. A return value of 0 indicates that the projectile
    has already impacted or the calculation could not be performed due to invalid
    parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Projectile Timing
    code: "uint32 currentTime = WorldTimer::getMSTime();\nuint32 timeRemaining = projectileInfo->TimeToImpact(currentTime);\n\
      if (timeRemaining == 0)\n{\n    // Projectile has already impacted\n    HandleProjectileImpact();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Schedule impact event\n    sWorld->ScheduleEvent([projectileInfo]()\
      \ {\n        projectileInfo->OnImpact();\n    }, timeRemaining);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ProjectileInfo object has been properly initialized
    with valid projectile data including speed and target position. The method relies
    on accurate timing from WorldTimer::getMSTime() for correct calculations. Performance
    is generally optimal as it only performs simple arithmetic operations.
  warnings: Do not use this method with uninitialized or invalid ProjectileInfo objects,
    as it may lead to incorrect time calculations or undefined behavior. Ensure that
    the current time parameter represents a valid timestamp from the game's timing
    system.
