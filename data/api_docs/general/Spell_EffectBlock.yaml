  brief: Blocks incoming spell effects by preventing them from affecting the target.
  description: The EffectBlock method represents a spell effect that prevents incoming
    spell damage or effects from affecting the target. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with other spell mechanics to create protective effects, such as
    blocking spells or preventing certain types of damage. It operates within the
    context of World of Warcraft's spell system and can be part of a larger spell
    implementation where it may be triggered by specific conditions or events. The
    method does not return any value but is used to handle the blocking behavior of
    spells in the game mechanics.

  notes: This method is part of the spell system's internal mechanics and should be
    used carefully as it may affect game balance. It requires proper handling of spell
    effects and can be involved in complex interactions with other spell components.
