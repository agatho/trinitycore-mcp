  signature: bool WorldObject::IsNeverVisibleFor(const WorldObject * seer, bool allowServersideObjects)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an object is never visible to a specific observer.
  description: This method checks if a WorldObject is never visible to a specified
    seer object, which is typically used in visibility calculations for players or
    creatures. It returns true if the object should never be visible to the seer,
    false otherwise. The method considers both client-side and server-side visibility
    rules, with allowServerssideObjects parameter controlling whether server-side
    objects are included in the check. This functionality is essential for determining
    visibility in World of Warcraft's visibility system, particularly when dealing
    with stealth or invisibility effects.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: The object that is checking visibility. This is typically a player
      or creature that may be observing the current object.
  - name: allowServerssideObjects
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether server-side objects should be considered
      in the visibility check. If true, server-side objects are included; if false,
      they are excluded.
  returns: Returns true if the object is never visible to the seer, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the object should not appear in the seer's visibility calculations,
    typically due to stealth or invisibility effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Visibility Check
    code: "if (object->IsNeverVisibleFor(player)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Visibility with Server-side Objects
    code: "if (object->IsNeverVisibleFor(player, true)) {\n    // Handle server-side\
      \ visibility\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is used internally by the visibility system to determine if an
    object should be excluded from a seer's visibility calculations. It's particularly
    important for handling stealth and invisibility mechanics in World of Warcraft.
    Performance considerations include checking against multiple objects simultaneously,
    which can impact server-side processing.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for general visibility checks
    without understanding the context. Incorrect usage may lead to visibility issues
    or incorrect behavior in game mechanics involving stealth or invisibility.
