  signature: void SpellMgr::LoadSpellInfoSpellSpecificAndAuraState()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes spell-specific and aura state data for all spells within the
    SpellMgr.
  description: The LoadSpellInfoSpellSpecificAndAuraState method is responsible for
    loading and initializing spell-specific information and aura state data for all
    spells registered in the SpellMgr. This method typically runs during server startup
    or database reload operations to ensure that spell-related configurations are
    properly set up before gameplay begins. It processes spell entries from the database,
    extracting and storing relevant spell-specific flags and aura states required
    for spell behavior calculations and validation during runtime. The method does
    not require any external parameters as it operates on internal spell data structures
    managed by the SpellMgr class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeSpellManager()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellInfoSpellSpecificAndAuraState();\n\
      \    // Spell data is now ready for use in gameplay\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or after
    a database reload. Repeated calls may result in duplicate data entries or memory
    leaks. The method accesses the database to retrieve spell-specific and aura state
    information, so performance can be impacted during large spell databases.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within gameplay loops or high-frequency update
    functions as it may block other operations. Ensure that all required database
    tables are properly populated before invoking this method.
