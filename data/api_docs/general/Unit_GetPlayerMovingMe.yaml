  class: Unit
  method: GetPlayerMovingMe
  signature: int * Unit::GetPlayerMovingMe() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the player ID of the player currently moving this unit.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the player who
    is currently controlling or moving the unit. It is commonly used in game mechanics
    to determine which player is responsible for a unit's movement, particularly in
    scenarios involving player-controlled creatures or vehicles. The method returns
    an integer value representing the player's GUID, which can be used for various
    operations such as checking ownership, performing actions on behalf of the player,
    or tracking player-related events. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper game state and ensuring accurate player interaction with units.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the player currently moving
    this unit. If no player is controlling the unit, it returns 0 or a null value
    depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = unit->GetPlayerMovingMe();\nif (playerId != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player is moving the unit\n    // Perform actions based on player ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to track player control over units. Performance considerations may arise
    when frequently calling this method during movement updates or in high-frequency
    scenarios.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in multi-threaded environments,
    as it may not always reflect the current state of player control if multiple players
    are involved. Also, ensure that the unit is actually being moved by a player before
    relying on this value.
