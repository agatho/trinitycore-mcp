documentation:
  brief: Returns the string containing excluded item types for the AH bot
  description: The GetAHBotExcludes method retrieves the configuration string that
    defines which item types are excluded from being auctioned by the Auction House
    bot. This string typically contains a comma-separated list of item class and subclass
    identifiers that the bot will avoid when creating auctions. The method provides
    read-only access to the internal exclusion list used by the AH bot's filtering
    system, allowing administrators to customize which items should not be automatically
    listed on the auction house.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the comma-separated list
    of excluded item types. The string format typically consists of item class and
    subclass identifiers separated by commas (e.g., '0,1,2' representing specific
    item classes). Returns an empty string if no exclusions are configured.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve AH Bot Exclusions
    code: "AuctionBotConfig config;\nconst std::string& excludes = config.GetAHBotExcludes();\n\
      if (!excludes.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"Excluded item types: \" << excludes\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No exclusions configured\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference to an internal string member, so
    modifications to the returned string will not affect the configuration. The returned
    string should be treated as read-only. The exclusion list format is typically
    parsed by the AH bot system to filter out unwanted item types during auction creation.
