documentation:
  brief: Completes and finalizes an active AuraScript execution call.
  description: The _FinishScriptCall method is a internal utility function within
    the AuraScript class that handles the cleanup and termination of an ongoing script
    execution context. This method ensures proper resource management and state transitions
    when an aura script has completed its processing. It typically performs tasks
    such as resetting internal script state, releasing temporary resources, and notifying
    the system that the script execution is finished. The method is usually invoked
    automatically by the TrinityCore framework during the normal execution flow of
    aura scripts, particularly after OnApply, OnRemove, or periodic tick handlers
    have been executed.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AuraScript Override
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnApply(AuraEffect\
      \ const* effect, AuraApplication const* app) override\n    {\n        // Custom\
      \ logic here\n        _FinishScriptCall(); // Finalize the script call\n   \
      \ }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use by the TrinityCore framework and
    should not typically be called directly from custom aura scripts. It's part of
    the underlying infrastructure that manages aura script lifecycle and execution
    context.
  warnings: Direct invocation of _FinishScriptCall outside of the expected framework
    flow may lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. Developers should rely
    on the standard aura script override methods rather than manually calling this
    internal method.
