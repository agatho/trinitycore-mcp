documentation:
  brief: Invites a player to join the group
  description: The AddInvite method adds a player to the group's invitation list,
    allowing them to join the group. This method is typically called when a player
    sends a group invitation to another player. The method checks if the player is
    already in a group, if they are invited, or if the group is full before adding
    the invitation. It returns true if the invitation was successfully added, false
    otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is being invited to join the group
  returns: True if the player was successfully added to the group's invitation list,
    false if the player could not be invited due to game rules or group limitations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Invitation
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    Player* targetPlayer\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayerByName(\"TargetPlayer\");\n    if (targetPlayer\
      \ && !targetPlayer->GetGroup())\n    {\n        bool success = group->AddInvite(targetPlayer);\n\
      \        if (success)\n        {\n            // Invitation sent successfully\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly send an invitation message to the player; it
    only adds them to the internal invite list. The actual invitation message is usually
    sent by calling SendGroupInvite() or similar methods. This method also checks
    for group limits and whether the target player is already in a group.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if the player is already in a group
    may result in unexpected behavior. Also, be aware that adding too many players
    to an invite list can affect performance, especially in large groups or during
    high-traffic server periods.
