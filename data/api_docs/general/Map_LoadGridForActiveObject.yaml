  class: Map
  method: LoadGridForActiveObject
  signature: void Map::LoadGridForActiveObject(float x, float y, const WorldObject
    * object)
documentation:
  brief: Loads grid for active object at specified coordinates
  description: This method loads the grid cell for a given WorldObject at the specified
    coordinates, ensuring that the object's grid is properly initialized and ready
    for processing. It is used to manage the spatial grid system for objects in the
    game world, particularly when dealing with dynamic objects that move between grid
    boundaries. The method ensures that the object's position is correctly handled
    within the map's grid system, allowing for proper interaction with other objects
    in the same or adjacent grids.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: X coordinate of the object's position
  - name: y
    description: Y coordinate of the object's position
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject whose grid needs to be loaded
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      map->LoadGridForActiveObject(obj->GetPositionX(), obj->GetPositionY(), obj);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object movement or when objects enter
    a new grid cell. It ensures that the grid system remains consistent and properly
    initialized for all active objects.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to grid loading issues, resulting
    in missing or incorrect object positioning within the game world.
