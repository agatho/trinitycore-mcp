  brief: Processes the acceptance of a quest from a quest giver NPC
  description: The AcceptQuest method handles the logic required when a player accepts
    a quest from a quest giver NPC. It validates that the quest is available and meets
    prerequisites, updates the player's quest log, and triggers any associated quest
    start events or objectives. This method is typically invoked internally by the
    core quest system upon a player's successful interaction with a quest-giving NPC.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the quest giver's object (typically an NPC) that provides
      the quest. Must be a valid pointer to a GameObject or Creature instance.
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the quest ID being accepted. Must point to a valid integer
      representing a registered quest in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance
    code: 'QuestAcceptanceManager manager;

      int questGiverGuid = 12345;

      int questId = 67890;

      manager.AcceptQuest(&questGiverGuid, &questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the quest giver and quest parameters are valid and
    properly initialized. It does not perform explicit validation of these inputs
    beyond basic pointer checks.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the quest giver is a valid NPC
    or that the quest ID exists in the database may lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes.
