  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::MonitorTargetCompetition(Player * bot, uint32
    targetId)
documentation:
  brief: Monitors competition targets for a player bot in the objective tracker system.
  description: The MonitorTargetCompetition method is used to track and manage competition-related
    objectives assigned to a specific player bot within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method likely updates internal tracking structures or triggers events when
    a target competition state changes, enabling dynamic quest or objective management
    based on player actions or external conditions. It serves as part of the broader
    objective tracking system that handles various in-game activities such as PvP
    battles, raid encounters, or other competitive scenarios where player performance
    is monitored against specific targets.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose competition
      targets will be monitored. Must not be null.
  - name: targetId
    description: Unique identifier for the target being monitored in the competition
      context. This ID typically corresponds to a specific NPC, player, or objective
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      uint32 targetId = 12345;

      objectiveTracker->MonitorTargetCompetition(bot, targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Competition Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerCompetition(Player* player, uint32 competitionTargetId)\n\
      {\n    if (player && player->IsBot())\n    {\n        objectiveTracker->MonitorTargetCompetition(player,\
      \ competitionTargetId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal AI or quest management system and
    may interact with other components like the ObjectiveTracker's event handling
    or state tracking mechanisms. The actual implementation details depend on how
    competition objectives are defined in the game logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method to prevent undefined behavior. Also, verify that targetId corresponds
    to an existing competition target to avoid invalid tracking states.
