  method: ReconstructPath
  signature: int PathfindingManager::ReconstructPath(PathNode * goalNode)
documentation:
  brief: Reconstructs the path from a given goal node back to the start node using
    stored parent references.
  description: The ReconstructPath method is used in the PathfindingManager class
    to rebuild a complete path from a specified goal node back to the starting node.
    It traverses the path by following parent pointers that were set during the pathfinding
    process, typically after an A* or similar algorithm has been executed. This method
    is essential for retrieving the actual route that was computed, rather than just
    the cost or heuristic values. The method assumes that the goalNode parameter has
    been properly initialized with a valid parent chain and that the pathfinding context
    is still valid. It returns an integer indicating success or failure of the reconstruction
    process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns 0 on successful path reconstruction, or a non-zero value to indicate
    an error during path reconstruction. A return value of 0 typically signifies that
    the path was successfully reconstructed and can be accessed via the manager's
    internal path storage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Reconstruction Usage
    code: "PathNode* goal = pathfinder.GetGoalNode();\nint result = pathManager.ReconstructPath(goal);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Path successfully reconstructed\n    // Access the\
      \ path via pathManager.GetPath()\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on parent pointers being correctly set in each node during
    the pathfinding process. It is generally called after a successful pathfinding
    operation and before accessing the final path for navigation purposes. The method
    does not modify the original nodes but rather constructs a new path representation
    from them.
  warnings: Ensure that the goalNode passed to this method has valid parent references;
    otherwise, the behavior may be undefined or result in an incomplete path. This
    method should only be called after a successful pathfinding operation has completed
    and the node structure is consistent.
