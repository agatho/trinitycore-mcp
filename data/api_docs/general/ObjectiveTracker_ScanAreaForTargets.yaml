  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: ScanAreaForTargets
  signature: int ObjectiveTracker::ScanAreaForTargets(const int & center, float radius,
    uint32 targetId)
documentation:
  brief: Scans a specified area for targets matching a given target ID and returns
    the count of found objects.
  description: The ScanAreaForTargets method performs a spatial search within a defined
    radius around a central point to identify and count game objects or units that
    match a specific target identifier. This functionality is commonly used in quest
    tracking, objective monitoring, and area-based event detection systems within
    TrinityCore's framework. The method leverages the underlying world object management
    system to efficiently query nearby entities without requiring explicit iteration
    through all world objects. It is designed to support real-time updates for dynamic
    objectives such as killing specific creatures, collecting items, or interacting
    with game environment elements.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: A reference to an integer representing the center point of the scanning
      area. In TrinityCore, this typically corresponds to a WorldObject's GUID or
      a coordinate-based identifier used for spatial queries.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular area around the center point where targets
      will be scanned. This value defines how far the search extends from the center
      in world units (typically yards).
  - name: targetId
    description: A unique identifier used to filter and match specific target types.
      This could represent a creature entry ID, game object entry ID, or quest objective
      ID depending on the context of usage.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the number of matching targets found
    within the specified area. A return value of zero means no matching objects were
    located in the scanned region. Negative values may indicate errors or invalid
    parameters, though this behavior should be verified based on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Quest Objective Tracking
    code: "int count = objectiveTracker->ScanAreaForTargets(playerGuid, 10.0f, 12345);\
      \ // Scan for 10 yards around player for creature with entry ID 12345\nif (count\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Update quest progress or trigger event\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Radius
    code: "float searchRadius = player->GetDistance(targetPosition) * 0.5f;\nint foundCount\
      \ = objectiveTracker->ScanAreaForTargets(targetPosition, searchRadius, questObjectiveEntry);\n\
      // Adjust quest progress based on number of found targets\nif (foundCount >=\
      \ requiredTargetCount)\n{\n    // Complete quest objective\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the spatial indexing system of TrinityCore
    and may perform better when used with pre-calculated center points rather than
    dynamic positions. The performance impact increases with larger search radii and
    higher numbers of matching objects. Consider caching frequently accessed target
    IDs to reduce redundant database lookups.
  warnings: Ensure that the center parameter is a valid WorldObject GUID or coordinate
    reference; invalid references may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Be cautious
    when scanning large areas as it can cause performance degradation in high-traffic
    zones. The method assumes that targetId corresponds to an existing game object
    type, otherwise results are unpredictable.
