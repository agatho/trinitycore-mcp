  method: GetId
  signature: uint32 RBACPermission::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the RBAC permission.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique numerical identifier associated
    with an RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permission. This identifier is used internally
    by TrinityCore to uniquely identify and manage permissions within the access control
    system. The method is a simple getter that returns the stored ID value without
    modifying any state. It is commonly used when checking or comparing permissions,
    or when building permission-related data structures in the game's authentication
    and authorization systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the RBAC permission.
    This identifier is assigned when the permission is created and remains constant
    throughout its lifetime within the system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving Permission ID for Debugging
    code: 'RBACPermission* perm = sAccountMgr->GetRBACPermission(123);

      uint32 id = perm->GetId();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("rbac", "Permission ID: %u", id);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Permission IDs in Access Control Logic
    code: "RBACPermission* requiredPerm = sAccountMgr->GetRBACPermission(456);\nRBACPermission*\
      \ userPerm = sAccountMgr->GetRBACPermission(789);\nif (requiredPerm->GetId()\
      \ == userPerm->GetId()) {\n    // Permissions match\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads a stored value without any locking
    mechanisms. The returned ID should not be modified by external code as it's part
    of the immutable permission definition.
