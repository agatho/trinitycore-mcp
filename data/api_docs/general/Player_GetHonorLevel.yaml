documentation:
  brief: Returns the current honor level of the player.
  description: The GetHonorLevel method retrieves the player's current honor level,
    which represents the player's standing within the game's honor system. This value
    is typically used to determine the player's rank and progression in PvP activities.
    The method returns a uint32 value that corresponds to the player's current honor
    level, which can be used for various game mechanics such as determining access
    to PvP rewards, honor-based items, or progression through honor tiers. This method
    does not require any parameters and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the player's current honor level. This
    value typically ranges from 0 to 10000, with higher values indicating greater
    honor. The specific range may vary depending on the game version and expansion
    level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 honorLevel = player->GetHonorLevel();

      // Use honorLevel in calculations or display

      std::cout << "Current Honor Level: " << honorLevel << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it simply returns a stored value without complex
    computations. The method may return 0 if the player has not yet earned any honor
    points, or values up to 10000 depending on the expansion level.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining player's PvP rank directly,
    as honor level does not always correspond to rank. It is recommended to use GetHonorPoints()
    instead for more accurate PvP ranking information.
