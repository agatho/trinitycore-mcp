  method: ValidateQuestGiver
  signature: bool QuestPickup::ValidateQuestGiver(uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a quest giver GUID is valid and accessible for quest interaction.
  description: The ValidateQuestGiver method checks whether a given quest giver GUID
    corresponds to a valid and accessible NPC or object that can provide quests. This
    validation ensures that the quest giver is within the player's interaction range,
    is not dead or hidden, and meets other game-specific conditions required for quest
    acceptance or progression. The method typically performs checks such as verifying
    the existence of the creature or game object, confirming its quest-giving capabilities,
    and ensuring it is in a state where it can interact with the player. This method
    is crucial for preventing errors during quest-related interactions and maintaining
    game integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver object, which can
      be a creature, game object, or other interactive entity in the world.
  returns: Returns true if the quest giver GUID is valid and accessible for quest
    interaction; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation of a quest giver
    code: "if (questPickup->ValidateQuestGiver(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with quest\
      \ interaction logic\n    printf(\"Valid quest giver\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      Invalid quest giver\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using validation before initiating a quest
    code: "uint32 questGiverGUID = player->GetQuestGiverGuid();\nif (questPickup->ValidateQuestGiver(questGiverGUID))\
      \ {\n    // Start quest dialog or accept quest\n    player->StartQuest(questId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid quest giver case\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Invalid quest giver.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database lookups or world object checks, so repeated
    calls could impact performance. It is recommended to cache results when possible
    for frequently accessed quest givers.
  warnings: Do not use this method without verifying that the GUID belongs to a valid
    quest-giving entity; incorrect usage can lead to invalid quest interactions or
    crashes.
