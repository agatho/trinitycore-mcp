  class: GuildIntegration
  method: IsGoodTimeForEvent
  signature: bool GuildIntegration::IsGoodTimeForEvent(uint32 proposedTime, const
    int & memberIds)
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a proposed time is suitable for guild events based on member
    availability.
  description: The IsGoodTimeForEvent method evaluates whether a given time slot is
    appropriate for scheduling a guild event by checking the availability of specified
    guild members. It considers factors such as current in-game schedules, player
    activity patterns, and potential conflicts with existing guild activities. This
    method helps prevent scheduling overlaps and ensures optimal coordination among
    guild members. The function typically returns true if the proposed time aligns
    with member availability, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: proposedTime
    description: The Unix timestamp representing the proposed time for the guild event.
      Must be a valid future time value.
  - name: memberIds
    description: A reference to an integer containing the list of guild member IDs
      to check for availability. This parameter may represent a bitmask or array of
      player identifiers.
  returns: Returns true if the proposed time is suitable for all specified guild members,
    indicating no known conflicts or unavailability; returns false if any member is
    unavailable or if scheduling conflicts exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 eventTime = time(nullptr) + 3600; // One hour from now\nint memberList[]\
      \ = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nbool isAvailable = guildIntegration->IsGoodTimeForEvent(eventTime,\
      \ memberList[0]);\nif (isAvailable)\n{\n    // Proceed with event scheduling\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Members
    code: "uint32 eventTime = time(nullptr) + 7200; // Two hours from now\nint memberIds[]\
      \ = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004};\nint totalMembers = sizeof(memberIds) / sizeof(memberIds[0]);\n\
      bool isGoodTime = true;\nfor (int i = 0; i < totalMembers; ++i)\n{\n    if (!guildIntegration->IsGoodTimeForEvent(eventTime,\
      \ memberIds[i]))\n    {\n        isGoodTime = false;\n        break;\n    }\n\
      }\nif (isGoodTime)\n{\n    // All members available, proceed with event creation\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks against player online status,
    guild activity logs, and calendar entries. It may cache results for performance
    optimization to avoid repeated database queries during frequent scheduling operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the proposedTime parameter is a valid future timestamp; passing
    past times or invalid values may lead to incorrect scheduling decisions. The memberIds
    parameter should contain valid player identifiers to prevent undefined behavior.
