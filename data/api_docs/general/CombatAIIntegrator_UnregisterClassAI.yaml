documentation:
  brief: Unregisters the class AI from the CombatAIIntegrator, removing its association
    with combat behavior handling.
  description: The UnregisterClassAI method removes the currently registered class
    AI implementation from the CombatAIIntegrator. This function is typically invoked
    when a creature or player's AI needs to be reset or replaced, ensuring that no
    stale or invalid AI logic continues to influence combat behavior. It effectively
    detaches any previously registered AI handlers and prepares the system for a new
    AI registration. The method does not take any parameters and performs no return
    operations, making it a simple cleanup function within the combat AI management
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unregistration
    code: 'CombatAIIntegrator* integrator = sObjectMgr->GetCombatAIIntegrator();

      integrator->UnregisterClassAI();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI is no longer needed or before
    registering a new AI. Improper usage may lead to undefined behavior if combat
    actions are still being processed after unregistration.
