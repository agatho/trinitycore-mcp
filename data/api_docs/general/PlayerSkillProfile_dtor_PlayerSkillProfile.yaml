documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PlayerSkillProfile instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerSkillProfile class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used to store
    a player's skill profile data. This method is automatically invoked when a PlayerSkillProfile
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource
    deallocation and prevents memory leaks within the TrinityCore framework. The destructor
    does not take any parameters and performs no special operations beyond standard
    cleanup.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of PlayerSkillProfile object
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* profile = new PlayerSkillProfile();

      // ... use the profile ...

      delete profile; // Triggers ~PlayerSkillProfile()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this method unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The class likely manages internal data structures
    such as skill lists or proficiency levels that require proper cleanup.
