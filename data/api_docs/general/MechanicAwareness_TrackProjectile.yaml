  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: TrackProjectile
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::TrackProjectile(const ProjectileInfo & projectile)
documentation:
  brief: Tracks a projectile's movement and updates awareness of its position and
    status.
  description: The TrackProjectile method is responsible for monitoring the trajectory
    and behavior of a projectile within the game world. It updates internal tracking
    mechanisms to ensure that relevant game entities (such as players or NPCs) are
    aware of the projectile's current state, including its position, velocity, and
    any interactions with obstacles or targets. This method plays a crucial role in
    maintaining accurate game mechanics for abilities that involve projectiles, such
    as spells, ranged attacks, or traps. The method typically integrates with the
    broader awareness system to notify nearby entities about the projectile's presence
    and movement.
  parameters:
  - name: projectile
    description: A constant reference to a ProjectileInfo structure containing detailed
      information about the projectile, including its position, velocity, target,
      and other relevant properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Tracking a Player's Spell Projectile
    code: "void MySpellHandler::CastSpell(Unit* caster, Unit* target) {\n    ProjectileInfo\
      \ projInfo;\n    projInfo.position = caster->GetPosition();\n    projInfo.target\
      \ = target->GetGUID();\n    projInfo.speed = 10.0f;\n    // ... populate other\
      \ projectile fields\n    mechanicAwareness->TrackProjectile(projInfo);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by spell or ability systems when a projectile
    is launched. It may internally update internal tracking structures, trigger events,
    or notify nearby entities about the projectile's movement. The method assumes
    that the ProjectileInfo structure has been properly initialized before being passed
    in.
  warnings: Ensure that the ProjectileInfo parameter is fully populated with valid
    data before calling this method, as invalid or incomplete information can lead
    to incorrect tracking behavior or game state inconsistencies.
