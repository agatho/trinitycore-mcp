  class: ResourceMonitor
  method: SetActiveBotCount
  signature: void ResourceMonitor::SetActiveBotCount(uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the active bot count for resource monitoring purposes.
  description: The SetActiveBotCount method configures the number of active bots that
    the ResourceMonitor will track and manage. This method is typically used in TrinityCore's
    resource management system to adjust monitoring parameters based on server load
    or configuration changes. The value set by this method affects how the ResourceMonitor
    allocates and tracks resources for bot-related activities, such as AI processing,
    memory usage, and performance metrics. It is important to note that this method
    does not validate the input count against actual bot availability; it simply sets
    the tracked value for monitoring purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: count
    description: The number of active bots to set in the resource monitor. This value
      represents the desired count of bots that should be considered active for resource
      tracking and management.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Active Bot Count to 10
    code: 'ResourceMonitor* monitor = ResourceMonitor::GetInstance();

      monitor->SetActiveBotCount(10);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Bot Count Based on Server Load
    code: 'ResourceMonitor* monitor = ResourceMonitor::GetInstance();

      uint32 currentBots = GetActiveBotCount(); // hypothetical method

      monitor->SetActiveBotCount(currentBots + 5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger resource management system in TrinityCore.
    The ResourceMonitor may use the active bot count to determine how many resources
    to allocate or how to distribute load across different systems. It's recommended
    to call this method with appropriate values based on actual server configuration
    and performance requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the count value passed to this method is within reasonable
    bounds for your server environment. Setting an excessively high value may cause
    resource allocation issues or unexpected behavior in the monitoring system.
