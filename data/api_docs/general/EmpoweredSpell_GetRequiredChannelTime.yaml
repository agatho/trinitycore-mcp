  class: EmpoweredSpell
  method: GetRequiredChannelTime
  signature: int EmpoweredSpell::GetRequiredChannelTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the required channel time in milliseconds for an empowered spell.
  description: The GetRequiredChannelTime method returns the duration, in milliseconds,
    that a player must channel an empowered spell. This value is typically used to
    determine how long a spell needs to be held in order to complete its effect. The
    returned value may vary based on the specific empowered spell instance and any
    modifiers applied during runtime. This method does not perform any validation
    or modification of internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the required channel time in milliseconds for the
    empowered spell. A value of zero typically indicates that no channeling is required,
    while positive values indicate the duration needed to complete the spell effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EmpoweredSpell* spell = ...;

      int channelTime = spell->GetRequiredChannelTime();

      printf("Required channel time: %d ms\n", channelTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Channel Time for UI Feedback
    code: "EmpoweredSpell* spell = player->GetCurrentSpell();\nint channelTime = spell->GetRequiredChannelTime();\n\
      if (channelTime > 0)\n{\n    // Update UI to show channeling progress\n    player->SendSpellChannelStart(channelTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell initialization or when displaying
    spell information to the user. The returned value should be treated as read-only
    and may not reflect dynamic changes unless the spell object is reinitialized.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value always means the spell will
    require active channeling; some spells might use this value for other mechanics
    such as cooldowns or resource requirements.
