  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: GetAvailableAccounts
  signature: int BotCharacterSelector::GetAvailableAccounts(const int & request) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of available bot accounts that can be used for character
    creation or management within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The GetAvailableAccounts method is designed to return an integer value
    representing the count of bot accounts currently accessible to the system. This
    functionality is typically utilized in automated bot management systems where
    multiple accounts are required for character operations, such as in player versus
    environment (PvE) or player versus player (PvP) scenarios. The method does not
    require any parameters and operates on a read-only basis, making it safe for concurrent
    access. It's important to note that the actual availability of these accounts
    may depend on server configuration settings and account limitations imposed by
    the TrinityCore core.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the total number of available bot accounts.
    A return value of zero suggests no bot accounts are currently accessible, while
    a positive integer reflects the count of usable accounts. In case of internal
    errors or invalid state, the method may return a negative value to indicate failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotCharacterSelector selector;\nint accountCount = selector.GetAvailableAccounts(0);\n\
      if (accountCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Available bot accounts: \" << accountCount\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No bot accounts available.\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot management system and relies on internal state
    tracking. It should be called periodically to ensure up-to-date account availability
    information. The method may perform database queries internally, so frequent calls
    could impact performance in high-load environments.
  warnings: Do not assume that all returned accounts will remain available after calling
    this method, as concurrent access or system changes might alter the actual number
    of usable accounts. Also, avoid relying on this method for real-time account validation
    without proper error handling.
