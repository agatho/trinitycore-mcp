documentation:
  brief: Adjusts formation positioning to avoid obstacles in the environment
  description: The AdjustForObstacles method modifies the current formation layout
    to prevent units from occupying positions that are blocked by environmental obstacles.
    This method is typically invoked during formation updates to ensure that NPC or
    player units maintain their intended formation while avoiding collisions with
    terrain features, buildings, or other impassable objects. The adjustment process
    evaluates the existing formation points and recalculates unit positions to find
    alternative locations that preserve the overall formation shape while respecting
    obstacle boundaries.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Formation Update
    code: "void MyFormation::Update()\n{\n    // ... other formation logic ...\n \
      \   m_formationsManager.AdjustForObstacles(m_obstacleCount);\n    // ... continue\
      \ with updated formation ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs pathfinding or collision detection calculations
    to determine valid alternative positions for units. It may be called frequently
    during dynamic formation changes, so performance optimization is important for
    large groups of units.
