  class: Garrison
  method: FindMap
  signature: Map * Garrison::FindMap() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Map object associated with the garrison, or nullptr if no valid
    map is found.
  description: The FindMap method retrieves the Map instance that corresponds to the
    Garrison's current location or internal map structure. This method is typically
    used within the context of World of Warcraft's garrison system, where garrisons
    exist on specific maps within the game world. The returned Map pointer can be
    used to access map-related data such as terrain, objects, and other map-specific
    properties. If the garrison is not properly initialized or has no associated map,
    this method returns a nullptr. This functionality is essential for operations
    that require map context, such as spawning units, managing garrison buildings,
    or handling player interactions within the garrison environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Map object associated with the garrison. Returns nullptr
    if no valid map is found or if the garrison is not properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindMap
    code: "Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nMap* map = garrison->FindMap();\n\
      if (map)\n{\n    // Proceed with map operations\n    sLog->outString(\"Garrison\
      \ is located on map %u\", map->GetId());\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to find map for garrison\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal garrison state management and may return nullptr
    if the garrison has not been fully initialized or if it's in an invalid state.
    The returned Map pointer should be checked for null before use to prevent potential
    crashes.
  warnings: Using this method without checking for a null return value can lead to
    segmentation faults. Additionally, the map returned by this method may change
    during runtime if the garrison is relocated or modified, so caching the result
    might not always be safe.
