  brief: Initializes quest reset times for all active quests in the world
  description: The InitQuestResetTimes method sets up the initial reset timers for
    all currently active quests within the game world. This method is typically called
    during server startup or world initialization to ensure that quest reset times
    are properly synchronized with the current game time. It iterates through all
    active quests and calculates their next reset times based on the configured reset
    intervals, ensuring that players can correctly track when quests will become available
    again. The method plays a crucial role in maintaining proper quest state management
    and preventing quest duplication or incorrect reset behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: World::instance()->InitQuestResetTimes();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during world initialization to avoid
    resetting quest timers unnecessarily. The method internally handles synchronization
    with the server's current time and ensures that reset times are properly calculated
    for all quest types including daily, weekly, and seasonal quests.
