documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is auto-accepted upon quest givers' interaction.
  description: The IsAutoAccept method checks if a quest will be automatically accepted
    by the player when they interact with the quest givers. This method is used to
    determine the automatic acceptance behavior of quests within the TrinityCore framework,
    particularly for quests that are designed to be accepted without requiring explicit
    player confirmation. It is commonly used in quest scripts and game mechanics to
    control how quests are handled during quest progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is set to auto-accept upon interaction, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the quest will automatically progress without
    player intervention.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (quest->IsAutoAccept()) {\n    // Quest will be accepted automatically\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest scripts and may be
    influenced by server settings or quest flags. The behavior of auto-accept quests
    can vary based on the specific quest's design and server configuration.
