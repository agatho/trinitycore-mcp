documentation:
  brief: Converts a Condition object into a human-readable string representation.
  description: The ToString method serializes the internal state of a Condition object
    into a formatted string. This is primarily used for debugging and logging purposes
    to provide a clear representation of the condition's properties. When the 'ext'
    parameter is set to true, it includes extended information about the condition
    such as type, target, and parameters. The method does not modify the original
    Condition object and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters:
  - name: ext
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to include extended details in the
      output string. When true, additional information about the condition type and
      parameters is included; when false, only basic condition information is returned.
  returns: A std::string containing the formatted representation of the Condition
    object. The exact format depends on the 'ext' parameter value and the internal
    structure of the condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for debugging
    code: 'Condition cond;

      // ... populate condition ...

      std::string debugStr = cond.ToString(false);

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("condition", "Condition: {}", debugStr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Extended output for detailed logging
    code: 'Condition cond;

      // ... populate condition ...

      std::string fullStr = cond.ToString(true);

      TC_LOG_INFO("condition", "Detailed Condition: {}", fullStr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to be lightweight and efficient for logging purposes.
    It does not perform any database queries or external API calls. The output format
    may vary depending on the specific type of condition being serialized.
