  signature: void RespawnInfo::~RespawnInfo()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a RespawnInfo object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The ~RespawnInfo destructor is automatically invoked when a RespawnInfo
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory or internal resources held by the
    RespawnInfo instance. In the context of TrinityCore's world management system,
    RespawnInfo objects are typically used to track respawn times and locations for
    game entities such as creatures and game objects. The destructor performs necessary
    cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'RespawnInfo* info = new RespawnInfo();

      // ... use the object ...

      delete info; // Triggers ~RespawnInfo destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Cleanup in Scope
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    RespawnInfo info;\n    // ... use info ...\n\
      } // ~RespawnInfo called automatically when info goes out of scope"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that all references to the RespawnInfo
    object are cleared before it is destroyed to avoid dangling pointers. The destructor
    likely handles cleanup of internal data structures related to respawn tracking,
    such as timers or cached entity information.
