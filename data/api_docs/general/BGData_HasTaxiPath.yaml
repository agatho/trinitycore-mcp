documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the battleground has a taxi path available for player
    movement.
  description: The HasTaxiPath method checks if the current battleground instance
    includes a valid taxi path that allows players to be transported between specific
    locations. This is commonly used during battleground initialization and player
    movement logic to determine if special transport mechanisms are active. The method
    typically evaluates internal state flags or data structures related to the battleground's
    transport system, such as whether taxi nodes have been properly set up for the
    specific map and game mode. It returns true when a functional taxi path exists,
    false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the battleground has an active taxi path that can be used
    for player transportation; returns false if no taxi path is available or configured
    for this battleground instance.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Taxi Path Before Player Movement
    code: "if (bgData->HasTaxiPath()) {\n    // Allow player to use taxi path\n  \
      \  player->AddDelayedEvent(500, [player]() {\n        player->TeleportTo(1234,\
      \ 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);\n    });\n} else {\n    // Fallback to standard movement\n\
      \    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"No taxi path available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal battleground data structures and may
    be called frequently during gameplay. Performance is generally not a concern as
    it's a simple flag check, but developers should ensure that the underlying taxi
    path data is properly initialized before calling this method.
