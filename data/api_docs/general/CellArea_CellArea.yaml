  class: CellArea
  method: CellArea
  signature: void CellArea::CellArea(int low, int high)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CellArea object with specified low and high cell coordinates.
  description: The CellArea constructor initializes a cell area boundary using two
    integer parameters representing the lower and upper bounds of cell coordinates.
    This class is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to define
    rectangular regions within the game world grid system. The low parameter represents
    the minimum cell coordinate, while the high parameter represents the maximum cell
    coordinate. This initialization sets up the boundaries for area-based operations
    such as object tracking, visibility calculations, and zone management.
  parameters:
  - name: low
    description: The lower boundary of the cell coordinate range. This value defines
      the minimum cell index in the area.
  - name: high
    description: The upper boundary of the cell coordinate range. This value defines
      the maximum cell index in the area.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CellArea Initialization
    code: 'CellArea area(10, 20);

      // Creates a cell area from cell coordinate 10 to 20'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using CellArea for World Grid Operations
    code: 'CellArea playerZone(5, 15);

      // Defines the zone boundaries for a player''s current area

      // Used internally by TrinityCore for object visibility and update management'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the CellArea class which is integral to TrinityCore's
    grid-based world system. The implementation assumes that 'low' is less than or
    equal to 'high', though no explicit validation is performed. Cell coordinates
    in TrinityCore typically represent grid positions where each cell corresponds
    to a specific area of the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the low and high values are valid cell coordinates within
    the expected range for your server's grid system. Using invalid coordinate ranges
    may lead to unexpected behavior in area-based operations like object visibility
    or zone updates.
