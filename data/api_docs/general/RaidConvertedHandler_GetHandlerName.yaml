  brief: Returns the name of the raid converted handler
  description: The GetHandlerName method retrieves the string identifier associated
    with a RaidConvertedHandler instance. This identifier is typically used to uniquely
    distinguish different raid conversion handlers within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method provides access to the handler's name for logging, debugging, or administrative
    purposes. It is a read-only operation that does not modify any internal state
    of the handler object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the unique name identifier of the raid converted
    handler instance

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or configuration
    loading phases when handler names are needed for identification purposes. The
    returned string should be treated as read-only and not modified by the caller.
