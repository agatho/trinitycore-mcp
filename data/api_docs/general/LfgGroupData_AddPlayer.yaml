  class: LfgGroupData
  method: AddPlayer
  signature: void LfgGroupData::AddPlayer(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the LFG group data structure by their GUID.
  description: The AddPlayer method is used to register a player within the Looking
    for Group (LFG) system by adding their unique identifier (GUID) to the internal
    tracking structure of the LfgGroupData class. This method is typically invoked
    when a player joins a group through the LFG system, allowing the system to maintain
    an accurate list of players participating in a specific group. The method does
    not perform any validation on the GUID itself, so it's assumed that the caller
    has already verified its validity. It is part of the core LFG infrastructure used
    by TrinityCore's LFG framework to manage group compositions and player participation.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be added to the LFG
      group. This value should represent a valid player in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LfgGroupData groupData;

      groupData.AddPlayer(123456);

      // Adds player with GUID 123456 to the LFG group'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Players
    code: 'LfgGroupData groupData;

      groupData.AddPlayer(1001);

      groupData.AddPlayer(1002);

      groupData.AddPlayer(1003);

      // Adds three players to the LFG group'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system and should only be called
    when managing LFG groups. It does not perform any synchronization or database
    operations; it simply updates the in-memory data structure. The GUID parameter
    must be a valid player GUID, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or non-existent GUIDs as it may lead
    to unexpected behavior within the LFG system. Ensure that players are properly
    validated before adding them to groups.
