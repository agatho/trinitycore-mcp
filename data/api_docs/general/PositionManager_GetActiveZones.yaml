  class: PositionManager
  method: GetActiveZones
  signature: int PositionManager::GetActiveZones() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of active zones in the current map.
  description: The GetActiveZones method returns an integer representing the number
    of active zones currently loaded and managed by the PositionManager for the associated
    map. This value typically corresponds to the number of distinct zone areas that
    are currently active within the player's current map context. The method is commonly
    used in zone-based gameplay mechanics, such as tracking player progression, managing
    zone-specific events, or determining which zones are currently relevant for quest
    tracking or area-based interactions. The returned count may vary depending on
    the map's layout, the player's location, and the server's active zone management
    settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of active zones in the current
    map context. A return value of zero indicates no active zones are currently loaded
    or managed by the PositionManager.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int activeZones = positionManager.GetActiveZones();\nif (activeZones >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Currently active zones: %d\\n\", activeZones);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Zone Management Check
    code: "PositionManager* pm = player->GetPositionManager();\nint zoneCount = pm->GetActiveZones();\n\
      if (zoneCount < 5)\n{\n    // Log warning or trigger zone loading logic\n  \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Warning: Low active zones detected (%d)\", zoneCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other PositionManager functions
    to maintain accurate zone state information. The value returned may be cached
    or updated periodically based on map loading/unloading events. Developers should
    consider that the count might change dynamically during gameplay as zones are
    loaded or unloaded.
  warnings: The method assumes that the PositionManager instance is properly initialized
    and associated with a valid map context. Calling this method on an uninitialized
    or invalid PositionManager instance may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    return values.
