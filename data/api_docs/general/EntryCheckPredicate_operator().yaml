  class: EntryCheckPredicate
  method: operator()
  signature: bool EntryCheckPredicate::operator()(const int & guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a given GUID meets specific entry criteria defined by the
    predicate.
  description: The EntryCheckPredicate::operator() method is a callable function object
    that tests if a provided Game Object ID (GUID) satisfies certain conditions. It's
    typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to filter or validate entries
    within databases, such as checking if a creature, item, or game object exists
    and meets specific requirements before processing. This predicate-based approach
    allows for flexible and reusable validation logic across various subsystems of
    the core. The method is const, indicating it does not modify internal state and
    can be safely called from multiple threads if the underlying data is properly
    synchronized.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of a game object, such as a creature,
      item, or game object instance. It must be a valid integer representing an existing
      entry in the database.
  returns: Returns true if the GUID passes the defined entry check criteria; otherwise
    returns false. The exact logic depends on how the EntryCheckPredicate was constructed
    and what conditions it enforces.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of EntryCheckPredicate with a GUID
    code: "EntryCheckPredicate predicate;\nint creatureGuid = 12345;\nbool isValid\
      \ = predicate(creatureGuid);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Process valid creature\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using EntryCheckPredicate in a container filter
    code: "std::vector<int> guids = {1001, 2002, 3003};\nEntryCheckPredicate predicate;\n\
      std::vector<int> validGuids;\nstd::copy_if(guids.begin(), guids.end(), std::back_inserter(validGuids),\n\
      \            [&predicate](int guid) { return predicate(guid); });"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a predicate design pattern commonly used in TrinityCore
    for filtering collections or validating entries. It's thread-safe if the internal
    state of the predicate is immutable and the GUID lookup does not involve shared
    mutable resources.
