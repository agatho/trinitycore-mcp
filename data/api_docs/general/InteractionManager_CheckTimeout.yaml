  brief: Checks if an interaction context has timed out based on configured timeout
    values
  description: The CheckTimeout method evaluates whether a given interaction context
    has exceeded its allowed time limit. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with interaction systems such as quest interactions, NPC dialogues, or object-based
    interactions to determine if the player's interaction window has expired. The
    method compares the current time against the context's start time and configured
    timeout duration, returning true if the timeout has been exceeded. This functionality
    helps maintain game state consistency by ensuring that interactions do not persist
    indefinitely and that players are prompted to re-initiate interactions when necessary.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the interaction context has timed out based on configured
    timeout values; otherwise returns false if the interaction is still valid within
    the time limit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timeout Check
    code: "InteractionContext context;\n// ... initialize context with start time\
      \ and timeout settings ...\nbool isTimeout = interactionManager.CheckTimeout(context);\n\
      if (isTimeout)\n{\n    // Handle timeout logic\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Interaction timed out.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate time tracking and assumes that the InteractionContext
    maintains proper start time and timeout duration values. The implementation may
    use system clock or game-specific time sources depending on the TrinityCore configuration.
