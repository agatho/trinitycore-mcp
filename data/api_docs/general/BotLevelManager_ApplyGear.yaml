  signature: bool BotLevelManager::ApplyGear(Player * bot, BotCreationTask * task)
documentation:
  brief: Applies appropriate gear to a bot based on its level and creation task configuration
  description: The ApplyGear method is responsible for equipping a bot player with
    the correct set of items based on its assigned level and the parameters defined
    in the BotCreationTask. This method ensures that bots are properly equipped with
    weapons, armor, and other gear that matches their level progression and role within
    the game. It typically checks the bot's current level, compares it against the
    task's gear configuration, and applies appropriate item templates or instances
    to the bot's inventory. The method may also handle gear scaling, enchantments,
    and stat distributions to ensure the bot is properly balanced for its intended
    gameplay role.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will receive
      the gear. Must be a valid player instance with proper initialization.
  - name: task
    description: Pointer to the BotCreationTask object containing configuration data
      for how the bot should be equipped, including gear templates, level requirements,
      and role-specific item sets.
  returns: Returns true if the gear application was successful and all items were
    properly equipped; returns false if any error occurred during the process, such
    as invalid parameters, missing item templates, or failed inventory operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic bot gear application
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player instance\nBotCreationTask* creationTask\
      \ = ...; // Task with gear configuration\nbool success = sBotLevelManager->ApplyGear(myBot,\
      \ creationTask);\nif (success)\n{\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Successfully applied\
      \ gear to bot {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Gear application with error handling
    code: "Player* bot = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayer(botGuid);\nBotCreationTask* task\
      \ = sBots->GetCreationTaskForBot(botGuid);\n\nif (!bot || !task)\n{\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      bot\", \"Failed to apply gear: invalid bot or task\");\n    return false;\n\
      }\n\nbool result = sBotLevelManager->ApplyGear(bot, task);\nif (!result)\n{\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to apply gear to bot {}\");\n    // Handle\
      \ failure case\n}\nelse\n{\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Gear applied successfully\
      \ to bot {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or level-up events.
    It may perform multiple inventory operations and should be used carefully in performance-critical
    sections of code. The method assumes that the bot has already been properly initialized
    with a valid character sheet and that the task contains valid gear configuration
    data.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid bot player instance
    will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure both parameters are
    valid before calling. This method may modify the bot's inventory directly, so
    it should not be called during active combat or when other systems are modifying
    the same inventory.
