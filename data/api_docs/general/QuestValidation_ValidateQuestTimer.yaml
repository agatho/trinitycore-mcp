  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateQuestTimer
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateQuestTimer(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player can start or continue a quest based on timer restrictions.
  description: The ValidateQuestTimer method checks if a given quest is allowed to
    be started or continued by a player, taking into account any time-based restrictions
    or cooldowns associated with the quest. This validation ensures that players cannot
    bypass quest timing requirements, such as waiting periods between quest completions
    or reactivation delays. The method typically integrates with the core quest system
    to enforce game balance and prevent exploitation of quest timers. It returns true
    if the quest timer allows the player to proceed, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being validated. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      timer is being validated. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the quest timer allows the player to start or continue
    the quest, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Timer Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateQuestTimer(12345, player)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest logic\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    // Inform player\
      \ that quest is not yet available\n    player->SendNotification(\"Quest is not\
      \ available yet.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may interact with the database to retrieve quest timer data and
    should be called before allowing a player to begin or re-initiate a quest. Performance
    impact is minimal as it relies on cached data where possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter corresponds to an actual quest in the
    database, otherwise behavior is undefined. The method assumes the Player object
    is valid and properly initialized.
