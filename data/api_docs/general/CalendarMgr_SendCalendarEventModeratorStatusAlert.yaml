documentation:
  brief: Sends a moderator status alert to players invited to a calendar event.
  description: The SendCalendarEventModeratorStatusAlert method notifies all invited
    players about their moderator status for a specific calendar event. This function
    is typically invoked when an event's moderator permissions are updated or when
    a player's role changes within the context of the calendar system. The method
    ensures that affected players receive real-time updates regarding their access
    rights and responsibilities related to the event, which is crucial for maintaining
    proper event organization and management in World of Warcraft's calendar subsystem.
  parameters:
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: A constant reference to the CalendarEvent object representing the
      event for which moderator status is being updated. This parameter contains all
      relevant event data including event ID, title, description, and time information.
  - name: invite
    description: A constant reference to the CalendarInvite object containing details
      about the specific player invitation. This includes the invitee's GUID, invite
      status, and current moderator permissions for the event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Event Moderator Update
    code: "void UpdateEventModeratorStatus(uint64 eventId, uint64 playerGuid) {\n\
      \    CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\n    if (!event)\
      \ return;\n    \n    CalendarInvite* invite = sCalendarMgr->GetInvite(eventId,\
      \ playerGuid);\n    if (!invite) return;\n    \n    sCalendarMgr->SendCalendarEventModeratorStatusAlert(*event,\
      \ *invite);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the calendar system's internal notification mechanism
    and should only be called when actual moderator status changes occur. The function
    does not perform any validation on the input parameters beyond ensuring they are
    valid references to existing calendar objects.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper event and invite validation may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that both CalendarEvent and CalendarInvite
    objects are valid before invoking this function.
