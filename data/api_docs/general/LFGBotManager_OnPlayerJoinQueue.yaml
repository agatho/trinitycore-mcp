  class: LFGBotManager
  method: OnPlayerJoinQueue
  signature: void LFGBotManager::OnPlayerJoinQueue(Player * player, uint8 playerRole,
    const int & dungeons)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player joins a LFG queue, processing their role
    and dungeon selection.
  description: The OnPlayerJoinQueue method is invoked when a player attempts to join
    a Looking for Group (LFG) queue in World of Warcraft. This method processes the
    player's requested role and selected dungeons, likely updating internal tracking
    structures or triggering bot-related actions. It serves as an event handler that
    integrates with TrinityCore's LFG system to manage player participation in group
    finding activities. The method does not return any value but may influence the
    LFG queue state or trigger subsequent bot behaviors based on the provided parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is joining
      the LFG queue. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: playerRole
    description: The role the player wishes to take in the group, typically represented
      as a uint8 value. Common roles include Tank (0), Healer (1), and Damage Dealer
      (2).
  - name: dungeons
    description: Reference to an integer representing the dungeon(s) the player has
      selected for joining the LFG queue. The value may encode multiple dungeons or
      represent a single dungeon ID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: LFGBotManager::OnPlayerJoinQueue(player, 2, 1234); // Player joins queue
      as DPS for dungeon ID 1234
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system integration and should be called from
    within the appropriate event handlers or queue management logic. It's expected
    to be invoked during player interaction with LFG UI elements, such as when they
    click 'Join Queue'. The implementation may involve checking for valid roles, validating
    dungeon IDs, and potentially triggering bot actions based on player selections.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent segmentation faults. The dungeon ID must be a valid LFG dungeon entry;
    invalid IDs could cause unexpected behavior or errors in queue processing.
