  class: TargetSelector
  method: SelectDpsTarget
  signature: Unit * TargetSelector::SelectDpsTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the highest-priority target for a DPS (damage per second)
    unit based on threat and combat conditions.
  description: The SelectDpsTarget method is responsible for identifying and returning
    the most suitable target for a damage-dealing unit within the game's AI system.
    It evaluates potential targets based on factors such as threat level, distance,
    health, and other combat-related metrics to determine which enemy should be prioritized
    for damage output. This method is typically used by AI-controlled units that follow
    a DPS role, ensuring they focus their attacks on the most threatening or vulnerable
    targets. The selection process considers both active combat state and target validity
    to ensure the returned Unit pointer is a valid and appropriate target for immediate
    engagement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the selected Unit object that represents the highest-priority
    DPS target, or nullptr if no valid target is found within the current context
    or conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "Unit* target = selector->SelectDpsTarget();\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with attack logic\n    me->Attack(target, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with fallback targeting
    code: "Unit* target = selector->SelectDpsTarget();\nif (!target) {\n    // Fallback\
      \ to nearest hostile if no DPS target found\n    target = me->GetAI()->SelectNextTarget();\n\
      }\nif (target) {\n    me->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI targeting system and should be called
    within appropriate combat contexts. It may internally use threat tables, target
    priority systems, and other game mechanics to determine selection validity. The
    returned Unit pointer must be checked for null before usage, as it can return
    nullptr if no suitable targets are available.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned Unit is valid without checking for null.
    Calling methods on a null return value will result in a crash. Additionally, this
    method may not account for all possible combat scenarios and should be used in
    conjunction with other targeting logic when necessary.
