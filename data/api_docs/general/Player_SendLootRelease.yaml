  method: SendLootRelease
  signature: void Player::SendLootRelease(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Releases loot from a specific object for the player.
  description: This method sends a loot release message to the player's client, indicating
    that the player no longer has access to loot from a specific object. It is typically
    used when a player has finished looting from an object or when the loot is being
    released by another player. The method ensures that the player's client properly
    updates the loot status for the specified GUID, allowing the object to be relooted
    by other players.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the object from which loot is being
      released. This is typically a creature or game object GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SendLootRelease(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint64 lootGUID = ...;

      player->SendLootRelease(lootGUID);

      // This ensures the player''s client removes the loot from the object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's internal loot system and should
    be used carefully. It does not directly affect the loot mechanics but rather communicates
    with the client to update the loot status for a specific object.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect loot status updates
    on the client side, potentially causing issues with loot distribution or preventing
    other players from looting from the same object.
