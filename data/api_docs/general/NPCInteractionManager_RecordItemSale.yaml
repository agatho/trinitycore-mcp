  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: RecordItemSale
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::RecordItemSale(uint32 itemId, uint32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Records the sale of an item by an NPC, storing the item ID and its sale value
    for tracking purposes.
  description: The RecordItemSale method is used to log the details of an item sold
    by a non-player character (NPC) within the World of Warcraft game environment.
    This function typically stores information about the item ID and its monetary
    value in internal data structures or databases, enabling features such as sales
    tracking, quest progression, or NPC inventory management. The method does not
    perform any validation on the input parameters, so it is expected that the caller
    ensures valid itemId and value are provided. It is commonly invoked during NPC
    interaction events when a player purchases an item from an NPC.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being sold. This corresponds to
      the ItemTemplate entry in the database and must be a valid item ID.
  - name: value
    description: The monetary value of the item sale, typically represented in copper
      coins. This value is used for tracking sales revenue or calculating rewards.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Sale Recording
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager interactionManager;

      interactionManager.RecordItemSale(12345, 5000); // Records sale of item ID 12345
      for 5000 copper'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Multiple Sales in Loop
    code: "std::vector<std::pair<uint32, uint32>> sales = {{12345, 5000}, {67890,\
      \ 10000}};\nfor (const auto& sale : sales) {\n    interactionManager.RecordItemSale(sale.first,\
      \ sale.second);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for managing NPC interactions
    and player transactions. It may be used in conjunction with other methods like
    GetItemSales() or ClearSalesHistory(). The implementation should ideally be thread-safe
    if called from multiple threads during high-traffic events.
  warnings: Ensure that itemId and value are valid before calling this method, as
    invalid values might lead to inconsistent data tracking or database corruption.
    This function does not perform any checks for item availability or player inventory
    status.
