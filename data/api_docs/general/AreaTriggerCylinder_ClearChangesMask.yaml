documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the area trigger cylinder, resetting its update
    state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of an
    AreaTriggerCylinder object. This operation is typically used during the update
    cycle to indicate that all previously marked changes have been processed and should
    no longer be considered as pending updates. The method ensures that subsequent
    calls to update or send functions will not include data that has already been
    synchronized with clients. It's commonly invoked at the end of an update loop
    to maintain proper synchronization state for area trigger cylinder objects within
    the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void AreaTriggerCylinder::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... update logic\
      \ ...\n    \n    // Mark changes for sending to players\n    // ... \n    \n\
      \    // Clear the changes mask after processing\n    ClearChangesMask();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core update system. Developers
    should not need to invoke this manually unless implementing custom area trigger
    behavior. The changes mask is used to track which properties of the area trigger
    have been modified since the last update cycle.
