  class: Creature
  method: GetRespawnTime
  signature: const time_t & Creature::GetRespawnTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the respawn time timestamp of the creature.
  description: This method retrieves the respawn time of a creature instance, which
    is stored as a time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the creature
    will respawn. The returned value indicates when the creature's respawn timer will
    expire and the creature will become available for respawn. This is commonly used
    in game mechanics to determine when a creature can be respawned after being killed
    or despawned.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the Unix timestamp when the creature will respawn,
    expressed as a time_t value. It indicates the exact moment when the respawn timer
    expires and the creature becomes available for respawn.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\n time_t respawnTime = creature->GetRespawnTime();\n\
      \ // Use respawnTime to determine when creature will respawn"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the creature's respawn
    timer logic. The value returned represents a future timestamp, so it will be greater
    than the current time unless the creature has already respawned. Implementation
    details include handling of time_t values and ensuring proper synchronization
    between server time and respawn time.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    time-related functions, as incorrect handling may lead to timing issues or incorrect
    respawn behavior. Also note that this method does not account for the actual respawn
    delay; it simply returns the stored respawn timestamp.
