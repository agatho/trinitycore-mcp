documentation:
  brief: Destroys a QuestPickup object and releases its associated resources.
  description: The QuestPickup destructor is responsible for cleaning up all resources
    allocated to a QuestPickup instance. This includes releasing any memory held by
    internal data structures, canceling pending operations, and ensuring that no dangling
    references remain. In the context of TrinityCore's quest system, this method ensures
    proper cleanup when a quest pickup event is no longer needed or has been completed.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of QuestPickup object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    QuestPickup pickup;\n    // ... perform operations\
      \ with pickup ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when pickup goes out\
      \ of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of QuestPickup object
    code: 'QuestPickup* pickup = new QuestPickup();

      // ... perform operations with pickup ...

      delete pickup; // Triggers the destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically called automatically by the C++ runtime when
    an object's lifetime ends. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless
    implementing custom memory management or placement new patterns. The QuestPickup
    class likely manages internal references to quest data, player state, and other
    game objects that must be properly cleaned up.
  warnings: Avoid calling the destructor directly unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. Also, ensure that no other code holds references to the object
    being destroyed, as this could lead to undefined behavior or dangling pointers.
