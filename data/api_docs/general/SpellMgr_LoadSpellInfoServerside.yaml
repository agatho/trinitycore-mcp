documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all server-side spell information from database into
    memory.
  description: The LoadSpellInfoServerside method is responsible for loading all spell-related
    data from the database into memory for use by the server. This method typically
    executes during server startup or when spell data needs to be refreshed. It processes
    spell definitions, effects, cooldowns, and other server-side spell properties
    that are required for proper spell handling within the game world. The method
    ensures that all spells are available for casting, targeting, and interaction
    with game mechanics such as damage calculation, healing, and status effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellInfoServerside();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when spell
    data needs to be reloaded. It's a blocking operation that loads all spell data
    from the database, so calling it frequently may impact performance. The method
    is typically invoked by the core server initialization process and shouldn't be
    called manually unless necessary.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during runtime can lead to memory leaks
    or duplicate spell entries. It should never be called while active spell casts
    are in progress as it might invalidate existing spell data structures.
