documentation:
  brief: Manages threat distribution among group members for the Monk AI.
  description: The ManageThreatInGroup method is responsible for handling threat management
    within a group context for a Monk AI-controlled unit. This method ensures that
    threat is properly distributed among group members, adhering to the Monk's class-specific
    mechanics such as the use of abilities like Detox, Provoke, and other threat-related
    abilities. It evaluates the current threat levels of nearby targets and adjusts
    the AI's behavior accordingly to maintain optimal group dynamics and prevent excessive
    threat accumulation by a single player. The method is typically invoked during
    combat situations where group coordination is essential for effective threat management.

    code: "void MyMonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\

    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the group's threat table and may adjust
    target selection or ability usage based on threat distribution. It is part of
    the core AI behavior for Monk units in a group setting, ensuring balanced threat
    management.
