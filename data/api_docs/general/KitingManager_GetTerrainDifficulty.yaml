  class: KitingManager
  method: GetTerrainDifficulty
  signature: float KitingManager::GetTerrainDifficulty(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the terrain difficulty factor for a given position
    in the game world.
  description: The GetTerrainDifficulty method computes a float value representing
    how difficult the terrain is at a specific location for kiting behavior. This
    value is used by the KitingManager to adjust movement patterns, pathfinding decisions,
    and NPC behavior based on environmental factors such as elevation changes, slope
    angles, and obstacle density. The method likely evaluates the positional data
    against internal terrain metrics to determine an appropriate difficulty multiplier
    that influences AI decision-making during kiting maneuvers.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer representing a position identifier or index within the
      game world's terrain system. This could correspond to a specific coordinate,
      zone ID, or internal terrain node reference used by the KitingManager.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 (or potentially higher) that represents
    the calculated terrain difficulty at the specified position. Lower values indicate
    easier terrain for kiting, while higher values suggest more challenging or obstructed
    terrain that may affect movement speed or path choices.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float difficulty = kitingManager->GetTerrainDifficulty(12345);\nif (difficulty\
      \ > 0.8f) {\n    // Adjust AI behavior for difficult terrain\n    player->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN,\
      \ 0.7f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Kiting Logic
    code: "void KitingManager::UpdateKitingBehavior(Unit* unit) {\n    Position pos\
      \ = unit->GetPosition();\n    int positionId = GetPositionId(pos);\n    float\
      \ terrainDiff = GetTerrainDifficulty(positionId);\n    \n    // Modify kiting\
      \ behavior based on terrain\n    if (terrainDiff > 1.0f) {\n        // Increase\
      \ caution in difficult terrain\n        unit->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_DISABLE_MOVE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger kiting system that evaluates multiple
    factors including elevation, slope, and environmental obstacles. The exact implementation
    details may depend on how positions are mapped to terrain data internally. It's
    recommended to cache results when calling this method frequently to avoid redundant
    calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the position parameter corresponds to valid terrain data;
    invalid or out-of-bounds position IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    difficulty calculations.
