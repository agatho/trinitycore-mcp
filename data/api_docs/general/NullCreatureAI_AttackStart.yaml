  class: NullCreatureAI
  method: AttackStart
  signature: void NullCreatureAI::AttackStart(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior against a target specified by the input parameter.
  description: The AttackStart method in NullCreatureAI is responsible for triggering
    the creature's attack behavior towards a specified target. This method is typically
    invoked when a creature needs to begin attacking an enemy, and it handles the
    initial setup of the attack state. The method takes an integer pointer as input
    which likely represents the target entity's identifier or reference. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI system, this method forms part of the core combat mechanics
    that govern how creatures engage with their targets. It is important to note that
    this implementation is likely a placeholder or null implementation, meaning it
    may not perform any actual attack logic but serves as a base for derived AI classes.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity identifier or
      reference. This parameter determines which creature or unit will be targeted
      for attack behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Start Usage
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    int targetId = 12345;\n    NullCreatureAI\
      \ ai;\n    ai.AttackStart(&targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the NullCreatureAI class, which typically serves as
    a base or placeholder implementation. The actual attack behavior may be overridden
    in derived AI classes. Developers should ensure that the integer pointed to by
    param0 contains valid target data before calling this method.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it takes an int pointer, but no validation
    is performed on the input. Passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior.
    Additionally, since this is a null implementation, calling this method will not
    produce any meaningful attack behavior in most cases.
