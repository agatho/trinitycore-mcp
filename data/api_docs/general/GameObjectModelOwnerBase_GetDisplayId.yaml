  signature: uint32 GameObjectModelOwnerBase::GetDisplayId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the display ID associated with the game object model.
  description: The GetDisplayId method returns the unique identifier used to determine
    the visual appearance of a game object model in the World of Warcraft client.
    This display ID corresponds to an entry in the GameObjectDisplayInfo.dbc file
    and is essential for rendering the correct model, texture, and visual effects
    for the object. The method is typically called during object initialization or
    when the visual state of the game object needs to be updated. It provides a read-only
    access to the internal display identifier stored within the GameObjectModelOwnerBase
    class instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the display ID of the game object model. This
    ID directly maps to an entry in the GameObjectDisplayInfo.dbc database file and
    determines how the object appears visually in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObjectModelOwnerBase* owner = ...; // Assume this is initialized

      uint32 displayId = owner->GetDisplayId();

      // Use displayId to determine visual appearance or perform related operations'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Object Initialization Context
    code: "void InitializeGameObject(GameObjectModelOwnerBase* modelOwner)\n{\n  \
      \  uint32 displayId = modelOwner->GetDisplayId();\n    if (displayId != 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // Apply visual settings based on display ID\n        // This\
      \ might involve setting up model render parameters\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that does not perform any computation or database
    lookups. The returned display ID value should be validated against the GameObjectDisplayInfo.dbc
    file to ensure it corresponds to a valid entry in the game's database. The method
    is thread-safe as it only reads from internal member variables.
  warnings: Ensure that the GameObjectModelOwnerBase instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized object could lead to
    undefined behavior. While the method itself doesn't validate the display ID, invalid
    IDs may cause rendering issues or client-side errors if not properly handled by
    the calling code.
