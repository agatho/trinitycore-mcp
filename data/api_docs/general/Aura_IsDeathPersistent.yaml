  method: IsDeathPersistent
  signature: bool Aura::IsDeathPersistent() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the aura persists through death.
  description: The IsDeathPersistent method checks if the aura remains active after
    a player or creature dies. This is used in various game mechanics such as soulstone
    effects, certain buffs that should continue post-death, or temporary enhancements
    that are meant to persist through resurrection. The method returns true if the
    aura is designed to survive death, and false otherwise. This functionality is
    crucial for implementing abilities like the Soulstone spell or other effects that
    must remain active even after a character has been killed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura persists through death; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an aura survives death
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura && aura->IsDeathPersistent())\
      \ {\n    // Handle logic for persistent aura\n    sLog->outString(\"Aura 12345\
      \ persists through death\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with aura application and removal
    logic. It's important to note that not all auras are designed to persist through
    death, and this behavior is usually defined during the aura creation or application
    phase.
