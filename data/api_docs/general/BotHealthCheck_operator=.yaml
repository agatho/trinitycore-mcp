documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotHealthCheck object to another
  description: The assignment operator for the BotHealthCheck class performs a deep
    copy of all member variables from the source object to the target object. This
    operator ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of their data,
    preventing unintended side effects when modifying either instance. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI system, this operation is typically used when reassigning
    health check configurations or resetting bot behavior states. The implementation
    handles proper memory management and maintains the integrity of the health checking
    logic.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotHealthCheck object whose contents will be copied to
      this object
  returns: A reference to the current BotHealthCheck object (this), allowing for chained
    assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotHealthCheck check1;

      BotHealthCheck check2 = check1; // Uses copy constructor

      check2 = check1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotHealthCheck check1, check2, check3;

      check1 = check2 = check3; // Chained assignment

      // All three objects now contain identical data'
    language: cpp
  notes: The assignment operator likely implements a deep copy strategy to ensure
    that any dynamically allocated memory or complex data structures within BotHealthCheck
    are properly duplicated. This prevents issues where modifying one object would
    inadvertently affect another. The operator should be efficient and avoid unnecessary
    copying of large data members.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this operator with objects that contain pointers
    or references to external resources, as improper implementation could lead to
    memory leaks or dangling pointer issues. Ensure that the source object remains
    valid throughout the assignment operation.
