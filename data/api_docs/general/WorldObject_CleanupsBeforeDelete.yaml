documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup operations before deleting a WorldObject instance
  description: The CleanupsBeforeDelete method is responsible for executing necessary
    cleanup routines prior to the deletion of a WorldObject instance. This method
    ensures that all associated resources are properly released and that the object's
    state is correctly handled before removal from memory. It typically involves removing
    the object from various subsystems, clearing references, and performing any required
    finalization tasks. The method is called internally during the object destruction
    process and should not be invoked directly by external code unless explicitly
    required by specific game mechanics.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      // ... perform operations ...

      obj->CleanupsBeforeDelete(true);

      // ... object is now ready for deletion'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal cleanup process and should not be called
    directly by developers. It's typically invoked during the destruction sequence
    of WorldObject instances, ensuring proper resource management and preventing memory
    leaks.
