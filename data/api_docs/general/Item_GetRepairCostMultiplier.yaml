  class: Item
  method: GetRepairCostMultiplier
  signature: float Item::GetRepairCostMultiplier() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the repair cost multiplier for the item.
  description: This method retrieves the repair cost multiplier value associated with
    the item, which determines how much of the original item value is required to
    repair it. The multiplier is typically used in conjunction with the item's base
    repair cost to calculate the total repair cost for the item. This value can be
    modified by various game mechanics such as player level, vendor discounts, or
    special items that affect repair costs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the repair cost multiplier, typically
    ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 indicates no discount and values less than
    1.0 indicate a discount applied to the repair cost.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float multiplier = item->GetRepairCostMultiplier();

      float repairCost = item->GetRepairCost() * multiplier;

      std::cout << "Repair cost multiplier: " << multiplier << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Item class's internal calculation system for determining
    repair costs. It may be influenced by player level, vendor discounts, or special
    item effects that modify the base repair cost multiplier.
  warnings: The value returned by this method should not be used directly without
    considering other factors like item quality and base repair cost. Also, this method
    does not account for any additional discounts or modifiers applied by vendors.
