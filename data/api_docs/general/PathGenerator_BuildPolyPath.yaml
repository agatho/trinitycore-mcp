  method: BuildPolyPath
  signature: void PathGenerator::BuildPolyPath(const int & startPos, const int & endPos)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and constructs a polygon-based path between two specified positions
    in the navigation mesh.
  description: The BuildPolyPath method computes a navigable path using polygonal
    navigation data between a starting position and an ending position. It utilizes
    the underlying navigation mesh to determine a sequence of connected polygons that
    form a valid route from start to end. This method is typically used by AI-controlled
    creatures or NPCs to find movement paths within the game world. The resulting
    path is stored internally and can be retrieved using other methods such as GetPath().
    The method assumes both start and end positions are valid points on the navigation
    mesh, and it will not perform any validation of these inputs. Preceding calls
    to Initialize() or similar setup functions should have been made for proper operation.
  parameters:
  - name: startPos
    description: The index or identifier of the starting position in the navigation
      mesh. This value must correspond to a valid polygon node within the mesh structure.
  - name: endPos
    description: The index or identifier of the destination position in the navigation
      mesh. This value must also correspond to a valid polygon node within the mesh
      structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Building Example
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      int startNode = 5;

      int endNode = 10;

      pathGen.BuildPolyPath(startNode, endNode);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with AI Movement Logic
    code: "void Creature::MoveToTarget(Unit* target)\n{\n    PathGenerator pathGen;\n\
      \    int startPos = GetNavMesh()->GetPolyIndex(GetPosition());\n    int endPos\
      \ = GetNavMesh()->GetPolyIndex(target->GetPosition());\n    pathGen.BuildPolyPath(startPos,\
      \ endPos);\n    // Use path for movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on a precomputed navigation mesh and assumes that the
    provided indices are valid. It does not handle cases where positions are outside
    of navigable areas or invalid nodes. The internal path buffer is overwritten with
    each call to this function, so previous paths should be copied if needed.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or non-navigable positions may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect path generation. Ensure all inputs are validated
    against the navigation mesh before invoking this method.
