  method: IsActive
  signature: bool StormbringerTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the Stormbringer tracker is currently active and tracking
    a valid state.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the StormbringerTracker instance
    is in an active state, meaning it is currently tracking or managing a relevant
    game event or condition related to the Stormbringer ability. This method typically
    evaluates internal flags or state variables within the tracker to return a boolean
    result indicating its operational status. The method is commonly used in game
    logic to conditionally execute actions based on whether the tracker is actively
    monitoring a specific effect or cooldown.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the StormbringerTracker is currently active and tracking
    a valid state; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check tracker status
    code: "if (tracker->IsActive()) {\n    // Perform actions while tracker is active\n\
      \    DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsActive in a conditional cooldown check
    code: "if (!tracker->IsActive() && player->HasAura(SPELL_STORMBRINGER_AURA)) {\n\
      \    tracker->StartTracking();\n} else if (tracker->IsActive()) {\n    // Handle\
      \ active tracking logic\n    ProcessStormbringerEffect();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically lightweight and does not perform heavy computations.
    It relies on cached internal state flags for performance reasons, making it safe
    to call frequently during game loops.
