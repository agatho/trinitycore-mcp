documentation:
  brief: Registers group event handlers for a bot AI instance
  description: The RegisterHandlers method initializes and associates various group
    event handlers with a specified BotAI instance. This method is responsible for
    setting up the necessary callback mechanisms that allow the bot to respond to
    group-related events such as member joins, leaves, invitations, and other group
    activities within the World of Warcraft environment. The method takes a handler
    identifier and associates it with the provided bot AI context, enabling the bot
    to participate in group management and coordination behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: handlers
    description: An integer identifier representing the type or category of group
      event handlers to register. This value determines which specific group events
      the bot will be able to respond to.
  - name: botAI
    description: A pointer to the BotAI instance that will receive and process the
      registered group event handlers. This parameter specifies the target AI context
      for handler registration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Handler Registration
    code: 'GroupEventHandlerFactory factory;

      int handlerType = 1;

      BotAI* bot = new BotAI();

      factory.RegisterHandlers(handlerType, bot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Handler Types
    code: 'GroupEventHandlerFactory factory;

      BotAI* bot = GetBotAI();

      factory.RegisterHandlers(1, bot); // Register member join handlers

      factory.RegisterHandlers(2, bot); // Register invitation handlers

      factory.RegisterHandlers(3, bot); // Register leave handlers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during bot initialization or when a new group
    event type needs to be supported. The handler identifier is typically defined
    by the game's internal group management system and corresponds to specific event
    categories. Ensure that the BotAI instance remains valid throughout the lifetime
    of registered handlers to prevent dangling pointer issues.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid handler identifier may result in undefined
    behavior or failed registration. Always validate the botAI parameter before calling
    to avoid null pointer dereferences. Re-registering handlers without proper cleanup
    may lead to memory leaks or duplicate event processing.
