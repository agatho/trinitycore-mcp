  signature: void BotAccountMgr::StoreAccountMetadata(const BotAccountInfo & info)
documentation:
  brief: Stores metadata associated with a bot account into the database.
  description: The StoreAccountMetadata method persists account-related information
    for a bot into the database. This typically includes details such as account name,
    creation timestamp, last login time, and other metadata that helps track and manage
    bot accounts within the TrinityCore framework. The method is usually invoked when
    a bot account is created or updated to ensure that its metadata is synchronized
    with the persistent storage layer. It operates synchronously and may block until
    the database transaction completes.
  parameters:
  - name: info
    description: A constant reference to a BotAccountInfo structure containing all
      relevant metadata for the bot account, including account name, creation time,
      last login time, and other identifying attributes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Storing Bot Account Metadata
    code: 'BotAccountInfo botInfo;

      botInfo.accountName = "BotAccount123";

      botInfo.creationTime = time(nullptr);

      botInfo.lastLoginTime = time(nullptr);

      // Assume botMgr is an instance of BotAccountMgr

      botMgr.StoreAccountMetadata(botInfo);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database I/O operations and should be used judiciously
    to avoid performance bottlenecks. It's recommended that this operation be performed
    on a background thread or within an asynchronous context if frequent updates are
    expected.
