  signature: uint32 Item::GetScalingContentTuningId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the content tuning ID associated with item scaling.
  description: This method returns the scaling content tuning ID for an Item, which
    determines how the item's stats are scaled based on the player's level and other
    game mechanics. The returned value is used to calculate item stat scaling factors
    during item generation and progression. This ID is typically set during item creation
    and reflects the content tier that the item was designed for. It plays a crucial
    role in determining item quality and stat distribution in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the content tuning ID used for scaling, which corresponds to the
    item's intended level range and stat progression. This value is typically set
    during item creation and represents the content tier that the item was designed
    for.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemBySlot(0);

      uint32 tuningId = item->GetScalingContentTuningId();

      // Use tuningId to determine item scaling parameters'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the item scaling system and should be used in conjunction
    with other item scaling methods. The value returned represents a specific content
    tuning ID that affects how item stats are calculated.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may not always return valid values
    for items created before certain expansions, particularly those that use different
    content tuning systems.
