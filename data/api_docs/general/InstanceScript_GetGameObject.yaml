documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a GameObject instance by its type identifier from the current instance
    script.
  description: The GetGameObject method is used to retrieve a specific GameObject
    instance within an InstanceScript based on its type identifier. This method is
    commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore instances to access and manipulate
    game objects such as doors, chests, or interactive elements that are defined with
    unique types. The method searches through the instance's registered GameObjects
    and returns the first match found for the specified type. If no GameObject of
    the given type exists within the instance, the method will return a null pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the GameObject instance matching the specified type, or nullptr
    if no such GameObject is found in the current instance.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a Door GameObject
    code: GameObject* door = instanceScript->GetGameObject(GO_DOOR_OF_MOGRIM);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check and Use Retrieved GameObject
    code: "GameObject* chest = instanceScript->GetGameObject(GO_CHEST_OF_TREASURES);\n\
      if (chest)\n{\n    chest->SetGoState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n    chest->RemoveFlag(GO_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the instance script's internal GameObject registry.
    It is important to ensure that the GameObject type identifier used matches exactly
    with those defined in the database or script definitions. The returned pointer
    should always be checked for null before use to prevent access violations.
  warnings: Using this method without checking for null return values can lead to
    segmentation faults. Additionally, if multiple GameObjects of the same type exist
    in an instance, only the first one found will be returned by this method.
