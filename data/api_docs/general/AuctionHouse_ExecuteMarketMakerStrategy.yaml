  class: AuctionHouse
  method: ExecuteMarketMakerStrategy
  signature: void AuctionHouse::ExecuteMarketMakerStrategy(int * player, AuctionSession
    & session)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the market maker strategy for the auction house, processing item
    listings and player interactions.
  description: The ExecuteMarketMakerStrategy method is responsible for managing the
    core logic of the auction house's market making behavior. It handles the processing
    of item auctions, evaluates market conditions, and manages player interactions
    with the auction system. This method typically runs periodically or in response
    to specific events within the auction house subsystem. The implementation likely
    includes logic for price adjustments, item availability checks, and maintaining
    a balanced marketplace. It operates on data provided through the AuctionSession
    parameter and may modify internal auction state based on market dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index
      within the auction system. This parameter likely identifies which player's actions
      are being processed or which player's session is active.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to an AuctionSession object containing the current auction
      session data, including active auctions, bids, and player state information
      that the market maker strategy needs to process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Market Maker Strategy Execution
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionSession session;

      // Initialize session with auction data

      auctionHouse->ExecuteMarketMakerStrategy(&playerId, session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing Strategy in Auction House Loop
    code: "void AuctionHouse::Update()\n{\n    int currentPlayer = GetActivePlayer();\n\
      \    AuctionSession activeSession = GetActiveSession();\n    ExecuteMarketMakerStrategy(&currentPlayer,\
      \ activeSession);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from within the auction house update loop or
    event handlers. Developers should be aware that this method modifies internal
    auction state and may trigger additional callbacks or notifications to players.
    The method assumes valid input parameters and proper initialization of the AuctionSession
    object.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is properly initialized and points to a
    valid player index. Improper handling of the session data could lead to undefined
    behavior or market manipulation issues. This method should not be called with
    null pointers or uninitialized session objects.
