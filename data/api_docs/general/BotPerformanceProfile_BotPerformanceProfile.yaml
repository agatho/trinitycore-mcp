documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BotPerformanceProfile instance with default settings.
  description: The BotPerformanceProfile constructor initializes a new instance of
    the BotPerformanceProfile class. This method sets up the internal state and configuration
    parameters required for tracking and managing performance metrics related to AI
    bot behavior in World of Warcraft. The constructor typically configures default
    values for performance thresholds, logging settings, and metric collection intervals.
    It ensures that the profile is ready to be used for monitoring bot performance
    without requiring additional setup steps.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BotPerformanceProfile instance
    code: 'BotPerformanceProfile profile;

      // The profile is now initialized with default settings

      // and ready to track bot performance metrics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore AI system
    when creating new bot instances. Developers should not need to call this directly
    unless implementing custom bot behavior tracking systems.
