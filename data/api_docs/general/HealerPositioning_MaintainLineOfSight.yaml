api:
  class: HealerPositioning
  method: MaintainLineOfSight
  signature: void HealerPositioning::MaintainLineOfSight(Player * healer, const int
    & allies)
documentation:
  brief: Maintains line of sight for the healer relative to allies in the group.
  description: The MaintainLineOfSight method ensures that a healer player maintains
    a clear line of sight to their allies while positioning themselves for optimal
    healing effectiveness. This is particularly important in combat scenarios where
    obstructed vision can prevent effective healing or cause the healer to be vulnerable
    to enemy attacks. The method evaluates the spatial relationship between the healer
    and group members, adjusting positioning as necessary to avoid obstacles or maintain
    visibility. It typically involves checking for environmental obstructions, calculating
    optimal distances, and potentially repositioning the healer character within the
    game world.
  parameters:
  - name: healer
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the healer character that
      needs line of sight maintenance.
  - name: allies
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the number of allies in
      the group that the healer should maintain line of sight with.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for maintaining healer positioning
    code: "void exampleFunction(Player* healer, int allyCount) {\n    HealerPositioning\
      \ positioning;\n    positioning.MaintainLineOfSight(healer, allyCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage within a combat healing routine
    code: "void CombatHealingRoutine(Player* healer) {\n    int groupSize = GetGroupMemberCount();\n\
      \    HealerPositioning positioning;\n    positioning.MaintainLineOfSight(healer,\
      \ groupSize);\n    // Proceed with healing logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with TrinityCore's pathfinding and AI systems
    to determine optimal positioning. It may involve checking for collision detection,
    calculating angles between positions, and potentially calling movement functions
    to adjust the healer's location. The implementation might be part of a larger
    healing AI system that prioritizes both effectiveness and safety.
  warnings: This method assumes valid Player pointers and proper group membership.
    Calling it with null healer pointers or invalid ally counts may result in undefined
    behavior. It should not be called during critical combat moments without considering
    performance impact on the game loop.
