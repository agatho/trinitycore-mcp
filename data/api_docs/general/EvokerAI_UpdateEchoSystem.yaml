documentation:
  brief: Updates the evoker's echo system, managing spell echoes and their timing.
  description: The UpdateEchoSystem method is responsible for managing the evoker's
    echo mechanics, which involve tracking and updating the state of spell echoes.
    This includes handling the timing, cooldowns, and activation of echo effects that
    are central to the evoker's gameplay style. The method ensures that echoes are
    properly maintained and updated according to game rules and player actions. It
    typically runs during the AI update cycle to keep the echo system synchronized
    with the current state of the evoker and its environment.

    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateEchoSystem();\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the regular AI update cycle and
    should not be invoked manually outside of the AI framework. The echo system may
    involve complex interactions with spell casting, cooldown management, and player
    state tracking.
