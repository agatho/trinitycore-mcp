documentation:
  brief: Coordinates group recovery operations for players in a group
  description: The CoordinateGroupRecovery method manages the recovery process for
    group members, ensuring that all players in a group are properly restored to their
    previous state after a temporary disruption such as a disconnect or instance reset.
    This method handles synchronization of player positions, health, mana, and other
    relevant attributes across group members. It ensures that group dynamics remain
    consistent and that no player is left behind during recovery operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Recovery Context
    code: "void HandleGroupRecovery() {\n    GroupCoordinator coordinator;\n    coordinator.CoordinateGroupRecovery();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    during group state transitions. Developers should not call this method directly
    unless implementing custom group recovery logic. The method assumes that all group
    members are properly registered with the coordinator.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the proper recovery context may lead to
    inconsistent group states or synchronization issues. Ensure that all players in
    the group have valid session connections before invoking this method.
