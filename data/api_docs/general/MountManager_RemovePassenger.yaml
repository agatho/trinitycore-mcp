  class: MountManager
  method: RemovePassenger
  signature: bool MountManager::RemovePassenger(int * passenger)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a passenger from the mount manager's passenger list and returns true
    if successful.
  description: The RemovePassenger method is used to remove a specified passenger
    from the mount manager's internal tracking system. This function typically handles
    the logic of detaching a player or creature from a mounted unit, updating relevant
    state information, and ensuring that the passenger is no longer considered part
    of the mount's passenger list. It may also trigger necessary game events or updates
    related to the removal of the passenger. The method expects a pointer to an integer
    representing the passenger identifier, which must be valid for the operation to
    succeed. If the passenger is not found in the current mount's passenger list,
    the function will return false.
  parameters:
  - name: passenger
    description: A pointer to an integer that represents the unique identifier (GUID)
      of the passenger to be removed from the mount. The value pointed to must correspond
      to a valid passenger currently on the mount.
  returns: Returns true if the passenger was successfully removed from the mount's
    passenger list; otherwise, returns false if the passenger is not found or an error
    occurs during removal.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of RemovePassenger
    code: "int passengerGuid = 12345;\nbool success = mountManager->RemovePassenger(&passengerGuid);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Passenger successfully removed\n    printf(\"Passenger\
      \ removed successfully\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to remove passenger\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to remove passenger\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the mount manager has already been initialized with
    a valid mount and that the passenger GUID is valid. It may internally perform
    checks for mount state, such as ensuring the mount is not in a transition or combat
    state before allowing removal.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer to the passenger parameter can lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure that the passenger GUID corresponds to an actual
    passenger currently seated on the mount before calling this method.
