  brief: Resets all instance difficulties for the player
  description: The ResetInstances method clears all instance difficulty settings for
    the player, allowing them to re-enter dungeons with default difficulty levels.
    This method is typically used when a player's difficulty preferences need to be
    reset, such as after a character level up or when switching between different
    difficulty modes. It affects all instances that the player has previously entered
    and resets their difficulty settings to the default state.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player's
    difficulty settings need to be reset, and it should not be used directly in most
    cases. The method affects all instances that the player has previously entered
    and resets their difficulty settings to default state.
