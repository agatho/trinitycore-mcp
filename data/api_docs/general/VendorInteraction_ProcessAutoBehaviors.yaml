api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: ProcessAutoBehaviors
  signature: InteractionResult VendorInteraction::ProcessAutoBehaviors(Player * bot,
    Creature * vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Processes automatic behaviors for a bot interacting with a vendor.
  description: The ProcessAutoBehaviors method handles the automated decision-making
    logic for a player bot when interacting with a creature vendor. It evaluates the
    bot's inventory, gold reserves, and vendor stock to determine optimal purchasing
    or selling actions. This method typically runs during vendor interaction cycles
    to ensure bots make efficient trading decisions without manual input. The behavior
    includes checking if items need restocking, selling excess items, and managing
    currency appropriately.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is interacting
      with the vendor.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor the bot is
      interacting with.
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum value indicating the outcome of the behavior
    processing. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILURE, or CONTINUE depending
    on whether actions were taken or if further processing is required.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Interaction
    code: "InteractionResult result = vendorInteraction.ProcessAutoBehaviors(bot,\
      \ vendor);\nif (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Bot successfully\
      \ processed behaviors\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot completed vendor interactions.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Different Interaction Results
    code: "InteractionResult result = vendorInteraction.ProcessAutoBehaviors(bot,\
      \ vendor);\nswitch (result)\n{\n    case InteractionResult::SUCCESS:\n     \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Vendor behaviors processed successfully.\");\n       \
      \ break;\n    case InteractionResult::FAILURE:\n        sLog->outString(\"Failed\
      \ to process vendor behaviors.\");\n        break;\n    case InteractionResult::CONTINUE:\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Further processing required.\");\n        break;\n\
      }"

  notes: This method is part of the automated AI system for player bots in TrinityCore.
    It assumes that both bot and vendor pointers are valid and properly initialized
    before calling. The method may perform database operations or modify player inventory,
    so it should be called in appropriate contexts where such changes are acceptable.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers for bot or vendor will likely result
    in a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the bot is actually within range
    of the vendor and that both objects are valid before invoking this function.
