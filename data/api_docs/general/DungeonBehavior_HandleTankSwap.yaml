  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: HandleTankSwap
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleTankSwap(Group * group, Player * currentTank,
    Player * newTank)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the process of swapping tank roles within a dungeon group
  description: The HandleTankSwap method manages the transition of the tank role from
    one player to another within a dungeon group. This method is typically invoked
    when the current tank becomes incapacitated, dies, or when a strategic swap is
    required during dungeon progression. It ensures proper communication with the
    group, updates internal tank tracking mechanisms, and may trigger visual or auditory
    feedback to inform players of the change. The method operates on the assumption
    that the group structure is valid and that both the current and new tank are members
    of the same group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the dungeon group where
      the tank swap is occurring. Must be a valid group with at least two members.
  - name: currentTank
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is currently acting as the tank
      in the group. This player will relinquish their tank role.
  - name: newTank
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will assume the tank role. Must
      be a member of the specified group and capable of fulfilling the tank responsibilities.
  returns: null

    code: "void example() {\n    Group* dungeonGroup = player->GetGroup();\n    Player*\
      \ oldTank = dungeonGroup->GetLeader();\n    Player* newTank = dungeonGroup->GetMember(1);\n\
      \    if (dungeonGroup && oldTank && newTank) {\n        dungeonBehavior->HandleTankSwap(dungeonGroup,\
      \ oldTank, newTank);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the DungeonBehavior class and is designed to be called
    during dynamic group management scenarios. It assumes that all players involved
    are within the same dungeon instance and that the group has been properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that both currentTank and newTank are valid pointers and members
    of the provided group; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The method does
    not validate whether the new tank is capable of assuming the role, so additional
    checks should be implemented in calling code.
