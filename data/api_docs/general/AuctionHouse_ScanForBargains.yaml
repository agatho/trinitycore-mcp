  signature: void AuctionHouse::ScanForBargains(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Scans the auction house for items that are currently priced below their market
    value.
  description: The ScanForBargains method performs a comprehensive search through
    the auction house database to identify items that may be undervalued relative
    to their current market price. This function is typically used by players or automated
    systems to find deals and optimize purchasing decisions. The method evaluates
    item listings based on factors such as bid amounts, buyout prices, and historical
    pricing data to determine if an item is being sold for less than its perceived
    fair market value. It does not modify any auction data but rather provides a filtered
    view of potential bargains.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that initiated the scan. This parameter
      determines which player's auction house data is analyzed and may affect filtering
      based on player-specific preferences or restrictions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myPlayer = ...;

      AuctionHouse::ScanForBargains(&myPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Player Filtering
    code: "Player* player = session->GetPlayer();\nif (player)\n{\n    AuctionHouse::ScanForBargains(&player);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid player case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal caching mechanisms to improve performance
    when scanning large auction house databases. The actual implementation details
    may vary depending on how the auction house system is configured and whether it
    integrates with external market data sources.
  warnings: The ScanForBargains method does not automatically purchase items or make
    any changes to existing auctions. It only analyzes current listings for potential
    bargains and should be used in conjunction with other functions that handle actual
    bidding or purchasing decisions.
