  method: SetNaturalLanguageEnabled
  signature: void BotChatCommandHandler::SetNaturalLanguageEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables natural language processing for bot chat commands.
  description: The SetNaturalLanguageEnabled method controls whether the bot chat
    command handler processes incoming messages using natural language understanding
    capabilities. When enabled, the system can interpret more human-like input patterns
    and respond accordingly. This feature enhances the conversational experience of
    in-game bots by allowing them to understand context and intent beyond simple keyword
    matching. The setting is typically applied at runtime and affects all subsequent
    chat interactions handled by this command processor.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Natural Language Processing
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      handler.SetNaturalLanguageEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Natural Language Processing
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      handler.SetNaturalLanguageEnabled(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely toggles internal flags within the BotChatCommandHandler
    class that determine how incoming messages are parsed and processed. It may also
    affect performance as natural language processing typically requires more computational
    resources than basic command parsing.
