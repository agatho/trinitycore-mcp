  brief: Initializes all cooldowns for the Discipline priest's abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and resets all cooldown timers
    for the Discipline priest's spells and abilities. This method is typically called
    during player initialization or when switching to the Discipline priest specialization.
    It ensures that all abilities start with their correct base cooldown values, preventing
    any unexpected behavior where abilities might appear ready before they should
    be. The method handles internal state management for cooldown tracking and prepares
    the priest for optimal gameplay performance.
