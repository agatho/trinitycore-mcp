documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant iterator pointing to the first element in the summon list.
  description: The begin() method returns a const_iterator that points to the first
    element in the SummonList container. This allows for iterating over all summons
    stored within the list using standard C++ iterator patterns. The returned iterator
    is constant, meaning it cannot be used to modify the elements it points to. In
    the context of TrinityCore's AI and creature management system, this method is
    commonly used when processing summoned creatures or objects associated with a
    specific unit, such as pets, guardians, or temporary summons. The method does
    not perform any validation or checks on the list contents; it simply provides
    access to the beginning of the container.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const_iterator pointing to the first element in the SummonList. If the
    list is empty, the returned iterator will be equivalent to the end() iterator.
  examples:
  - title: Basic iteration over summons
    code: "for (const auto& summon : creature->GetSummonList()) {\n    if (summon)\n\
      \        SendSummonMessage(summon);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using iterator with begin() and end()
    code: "auto itr = creature->GetSummonList().begin();\nfor (; itr != creature->GetSummonList().end();\
      \ ++itr) {\n    if (*itr && (*itr)->IsAlive())\n        DoSomethingWithAliveSummon(*itr);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The SummonList is typically used in the context of Creature or Unit classes
    where summons are tracked. The returned const_iterator should not be modified
    directly, as it's a constant reference to the container's elements. Iteration
    using begin() and end() follows standard STL conventions.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying the SummonList during iteration - doing so
    may invalidate iterators. Always check if the iterator is valid before dereferencing
    it in loops. If the list is modified while iterating, results are undefined.
