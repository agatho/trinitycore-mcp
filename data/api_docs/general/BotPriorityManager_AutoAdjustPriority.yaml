  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: AutoAdjustPriority
  signature: void BotPriorityManager::AutoAdjustPriority(Player * bot, uint32 currentTime)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the priority of a bot based on current game conditions and player
    state.
  description: The AutoAdjustPriority method dynamically modifies the priority settings
    for a specified bot player according to real-time game conditions. This function
    evaluates various factors such as the bot's current health, mana levels, combat
    status, and proximity to targets or objectives. It is typically invoked during
    regular update cycles to ensure that bots prioritize actions appropriately based
    on their immediate environment and mission requirements. The method does not require
    explicit parameters beyond the bot player reference and current time, making it
    suitable for automated scheduling within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose priority
      is to be adjusted. Must not be null.
  - name: currentTime
    description: Current timestamp in milliseconds used for time-based calculations
      and scheduling of priority adjustments.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void UpdateBotPriorities(Player* bot, uint32 currentTime)\n{\n    BotPriorityManager::AutoAdjustPriority(bot,\
      \ currentTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameUpdateLoop()\n{\n    for (auto& bot : GetBots())\n    {\n    \
      \    uint32 now = getMSTime();\n        BotPriorityManager::AutoAdjustPriority(bot,\
      \ now);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during game updates and should
    not block execution. It relies on internal state tracking of the bot's current
    situation and may modify the bot's behavior in real-time without requiring manual
    intervention.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and points to an actual
    bot instance, as passing a null or invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior.
    The method assumes that the bot has been initialized properly with necessary AI
    components.
