documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes creature template spells from the database into memory
    for use in game mechanics.
  description: The LoadCreatureTemplateSpells method is responsible for retrieving
    all creature template spell data from the database and loading it into memory.
    This method ensures that each creature template has access to its associated spells,
    which are used during AI behavior, combat, and other gameplay interactions. It
    typically runs during server startup or database reload operations to populate
    internal data structures with spell information linked to specific creature templates.
    The method processes entries from the creature_template_spells table in the database
    and prepares them for runtime use by the AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadCreatureTemplateSpells();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    processes. It's important to note that this method assumes the database connection
    is already established and that the creature_template_spells table exists with
    proper schema. The loaded spell data is cached in memory for fast access during
    runtime AI calculations.
  warnings: Improperly formatted or missing entries in the creature_template_spells
    database table can cause runtime errors or unexpected AI behavior. This method
    should only be called after the database connection is fully initialized and validated.
