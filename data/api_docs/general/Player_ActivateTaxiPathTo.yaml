    int speed, int param3)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a taxi path for the player using specified taxi path ID and spell
    ID
  description: This method activates a taxi path for the player, allowing them to
    travel through the game world using predefined taxi routes. The method requires
    a valid taxi path ID and spell ID to function properly. It handles the activation
    of the taxi path with specific speed parameters and may include additional parameters
    for complex routing. The method returns true if successful in activating the taxi
    path, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for player movement and navigation
    within World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: taxi_path_id
    description: The unique identifier of the taxi path to be activated. This must
      correspond to a valid taxi path in the game database.
  - name: spellid
    description: The spell ID associated with the taxi path activation. This determines
      which spell is used for the taxi journey and must match the taxi path's requirements.
  - name: speed
    description: The speed parameter for the taxi path, controlling how fast the player
      moves along the route. Negative values may indicate special movement behaviors.
  - name: param3
    description: Additional parameter that may be used to control specific aspects
      of the taxi path activation or movement behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the taxi path was successfully activated, false otherwise.
    The method may return false if the taxi path ID or spell ID is invalid or if the
    player cannot activate the path due to game mechanics constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taxi Path Activation
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      bool result = player->ActivateTaxiPathTo(12345, 67890, 1000, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Taxi Path Activation with Speed Control
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      bool result = player->ActivateTaxiPathTo(54321, 98765, -500, 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's movement system and should be used carefully
    as it affects player positioning. The method requires valid taxi path IDs and
    spell IDs to function correctly. It may not work if the player has already started
    a taxi journey or if the path is invalid.
  warnings: The method may fail if the player is already in motion or if the taxi
    path ID does not match any valid paths in the database. Be cautious when using
    negative speed values as they might cause unexpected behavior.
