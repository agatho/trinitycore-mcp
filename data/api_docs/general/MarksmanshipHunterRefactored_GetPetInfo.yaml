documentation:
  brief: Retrieves and returns the current pet's informational identifier for the
    Marksmanship Hunter class.
  description: The GetPetInfo method is designed to fetch specific information about
    the hunter's current pet, such as its status, level, or unique identifier. This
    method is part of the MarksmanshipHunterRefactored class which implements specialized
    behavior for marksmanship-focused hunters in TrinityCore. It returns an integer
    value that typically represents a bitmask or encoded data containing various pet-related
    attributes. The exact meaning of the returned integer depends on how the pet information
    is structured within the game's internal systems and may include flags indicating
    pet state, health, or other relevant properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing encoded pet information. Possible values
    could indicate pet status (active/inactive), level, health percentage, or other
    attributes depending on implementation. A return value of 0 might imply no pet
    is present or an error occurred during retrieval.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int petInfo = hunter.GetPetInfo();\nif (petInfo != 0) {\n    // Pet exists\
      \ and information is available\n    std::cout << \"Pet info: \" << petInfo <<\
      \ std::endl;\n} else {\n    // No pet or error occurred\n    std::cout << \"\
      No active pet.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal pet management systems and may
    be used in AI decision-making logic. It is recommended to check if a pet exists
    before calling this method to avoid potential errors or undefined behavior.
  warnings: The return value interpretation may vary based on the game version and
    internal implementation details. Always validate the returned integer against
    expected ranges or known flag values to ensure correct behavior.
