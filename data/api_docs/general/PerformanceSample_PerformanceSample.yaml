documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new performance sample instance for tracking system resource
    usage.
  description: The PerformanceSample constructor initializes a new instance of the
    PerformanceSample class, setting up internal tracking structures for monitoring
    system performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and execution
    time. This class is typically used in TrinityCore's profiling and debugging systems
    to gather detailed information about server performance during various operations.
    The initialization process sets default values for all internal counters and prepares
    the object for data collection.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a PerformanceSample Instance
    code: 'PerformanceSample sample;

      // The sample object is now initialized and ready to track performance metrics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any expensive operations or system calls.
    It simply initializes internal state variables. The actual performance measurement
    occurs when calling other methods like Start(), Stop(), or GetMetrics(). This
    class is designed to be lightweight and should not impact server performance during
    normal operation.
