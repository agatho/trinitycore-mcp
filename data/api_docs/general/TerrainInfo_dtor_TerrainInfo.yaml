documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TerrainInfo object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The TerrainInfo destructor is automatically called when a TerrainInfo
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of
    any memory, data structures, or system resources allocated during the object's
    lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation,
    this typically involves releasing terrain-related data such as height maps, liquid
    data, and collision information that may have been loaded for a specific map or
    zone. The destructor is essential for preventing memory leaks and maintaining
    stable performance in environments where many terrain objects are dynamically
    created and destroyed during gameplay.

  - title: Automatic destruction of TerrainInfo object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    TerrainInfo* terrain = new TerrainInfo();\n\
      \    // ... use terrain ...\n    delete terrain; // Destructor called here\n\
      }\n\n// Or with automatic storage:\nvoid AnotherFunction()\n{\n    TerrainInfo\
      \ terrain;\n    // Destructor automatically called when 'terrain' goes out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived classes. It's important to note that this destructor should not be
    called directly unless you're explicitly managing object lifetime through pointers.
    The implementation typically handles cleanup of internal data structures like
    heightmaps, liquid data, and collision detection information.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it
    will result in undefined behavior. Also, ensure that no other threads are accessing
    the TerrainInfo object when destruction begins to prevent race conditions.
