  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: CalculateTargetBotCount
  signature: uint32 BotPopulationManager::CalculateTargetBotCount(const ZonePopulation
    & zone) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the target number of bots for a given zone population.
  description: The CalculateTargetBotCount method determines the optimal number of
    bots to spawn in a specific zone based on the current zone population data. This
    method is used by the bot management system to dynamically adjust bot density
    according to player activity and zone requirements. The calculation takes into
    account various factors such as zone type, player density, and server configuration
    settings. It ensures that bot populations remain balanced and appropriate for
    the gameplay experience without overwhelming or underpopulating zones.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated target number of bots
    for the specified zone. This value indicates how many bots should ideally be present
    in the zone to maintain proper population balance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPopulationManager* botMgr = BotPopulationManager::Instance();

      ZonePopulation zonePop;

      // Assume zonePop is populated with relevant data

      uint32 targetCount = botMgr->CalculateTargetBotCount(zonePop);

      // Use targetCount to determine how many bots to spawn'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations based on predefined thresholds and
    scaling factors. It may cache results or use historical data to make more informed
    decisions about bot population targets. The implementation might vary depending
    on server configuration settings related to bot spawning.
  warnings: The method assumes that the ZonePopulation parameter contains valid and
    up-to-date information. Using stale or incorrect zone data could lead to inaccurate
    bot count calculations, potentially causing overcrowding or underpopulation issues
    in zones.
