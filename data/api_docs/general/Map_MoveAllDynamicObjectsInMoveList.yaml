documentation:
  brief: Moves all dynamic objects in the map's movement list to their new positions.
  description: The MoveAllDynamicObjectsInMoveList method processes and applies position
    updates for all dynamic objects (such as creatures, game objects, and players)
    that have been marked for movement within the current map. This method is typically
    invoked during the map's update cycle to synchronize object positions with their
    intended locations. It ensures that object movements are properly handled and
    that the spatial integrity of the game world is maintained. The method operates
    on a list of objects that have pending movement operations, applying these changes
    in a controlled manner to prevent inconsistencies or visual glitches.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Map Update Loop
    code: "void Map::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n \
      \   MoveAllDynamicObjectsInMoveList();\n    // ... continue with other updates\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal game loop and should not be called manually
    outside of the map's update cycle. It is designed to be thread-safe within the
    context of the map's update thread, but calling it from other threads may lead
    to race conditions or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are implementing a custom
    map update logic. Improper usage can result in object position inconsistencies,
    visual artifacts, or server instability. This method assumes that all objects
    in the movement list have valid movement data and should be processed sequentially.
