  class: AuctionHouse
  method: HandleBulkItemTrading
  signature: void AuctionHouse::HandleBulkItemTrading(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Handles bulk item trading operations within the auction house system for
    a specified player.
  description: The HandleBulkItemTrading method processes bulk trading activities
    in the auction house for a given player. This function likely manages multiple
    item transactions simultaneously, such as buying or selling several items at once,
    and ensures proper inventory updates, gold adjustments, and auction house state
    management. It operates within the context of TrinityCore's auction house subsystem
    and interacts with player data, item databases, and transaction processing logic.
    The method may validate item eligibility, check player permissions, and handle
    complex trade scenarios involving multiple items and currencies.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the auction house system. This parameter identifies which player's
      trading activities are being processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bulk Trading Handler Call
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionHouse ah;

      ah.HandleBulkItemTrading(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger auction house management system and
    may be called during player interactions with bulk trading features. Developers
    should ensure proper locking mechanisms are in place when accessing shared auction
    house data structures.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player parameter could lead to invalid memory
    access or incorrect transaction processing. The method assumes valid player GUIDs
    and proper initialization of auction house subsystem components.
