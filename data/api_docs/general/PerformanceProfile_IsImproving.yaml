  method: IsImproving
  signature: bool PerformanceProfile::IsImproving() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the performance profile shows improvement over time.
  description: The IsImproving method evaluates the current state of a PerformanceProfile
    to determine if there has been an improvement in performance metrics. This method
    is typically used in profiling systems to track optimization progress or identify
    when performance degradation occurs. It analyzes internal data structures that
    store historical performance measurements and compares them against thresholds
    or trends to make this determination. The method does not modify any state and
    is purely observational.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the performance profile indicates improvement, false otherwise.
    Improvement is determined based on internal comparison logic that may consider
    metrics such as execution time, resource usage, or other relevant performance
    indicators.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PerformanceProfile profile;\n// ... populate profile with data ...\nif\
      \ (profile.IsImproving()) {\n    printf(\"Performance is improving\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"No improvement detected\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Profiling Loop
    code: "void MonitorPerformance() {\n    static PerformanceProfile lastProfile;\n\
      \    PerformanceProfile currentProfile;\n    \n    // ... gather performance\
      \ data into currentProfile ...\n    \n    if (currentProfile.IsImproving())\
      \ {\n        printf(\"Optimization successful\\n\");\n        lastProfile =\
      \ currentProfile; // Update baseline\n    } else if (lastProfile.IsImproving())\
      \ {\n        printf(\"Performance regression detected\\n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of performance data and assumes that
    the PerformanceProfile has been properly populated with historical metrics before
    calling IsImproving. The exact algorithm for determining improvement may vary
    depending on implementation details, but typically involves comparing recent measurements
    against previous ones or expected baselines.
