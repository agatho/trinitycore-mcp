  method: GetActiveAccountCount
  signature: uint32 BotAccountMgr::GetActiveAccountCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of active bot accounts managed by the BotAccountMgr
    instance.
  description: The GetActiveAccountCount method returns the number of currently active
    bot accounts within the system. This count represents all bot accounts that are
    in an operational state, meaning they have been initialized and are actively being
    managed by the bot account manager. The method does not include inactive or disabled
    accounts in its calculation. This functionality is typically used for monitoring
    system resources, tracking active bot usage, or enforcing limits on concurrent
    bot operations. The returned value is a simple unsigned 32-bit integer representing
    the total number of active accounts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total count of active bot accounts currently
    managed by this BotAccountMgr instance. Returns 0 if no active accounts exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Bot Count
    code: "uint32 activeCount = sBotAccountMgr->GetActiveAccountCount();\nif (activeCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Currently managing {} active bot accounts.\"\
      , activeCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other account management
    functions to provide a complete picture of bot account state. The implementation
    likely involves iterating through an internal collection or container of active
    accounts and counting them. Performance should be minimal as it's a simple count
    operation, but repeated calls in tight loops may have minor impact.
