documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotCharacterDistribution object to another, performing
    a deep copy of all internal data.
  description: The assignment operator for the BotCharacterDistribution class performs
    a deep copy of all member variables from the source object to the target object.
    This method ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of their data,
    preventing unintended side effects when modifying either instance. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this operation is crucial for duplicating character
    distribution configurations across different bot instances or scenarios. The implementation
    handles memory management properly to avoid memory leaks or dangling pointers.
    This operator typically follows the rule of three/five principles, ensuring that
    all dynamically allocated resources are correctly copied and managed.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotCharacterDistribution object whose contents will be
      copied to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current BotCharacterDistribution object (this), allowing
    for chained assignment operations such as obj1 = obj2 = obj3;
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution source;

      // ... initialize source ...

      BotCharacterDistribution target = source; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      target = source; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution a, b, c;

      // ... initialize objects ...

      a = b = c; // Chained assignment - all three objects get the same values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator should properly handle self-assignment (when param0 is the
    same object as *this) to prevent data corruption. The implementation likely includes
    checks for self-assignment and proper cleanup of existing resources before copying
    new data. In a bot system context, this ensures that character distribution settings
    can be safely shared or duplicated between different bot configurations without
    affecting each other.
  warnings: Ensure that the source object is properly initialized before assignment
    to avoid copying invalid or uninitialized data. Be cautious when using this operator
    in performance-critical code paths as deep copying may involve significant memory
    allocation and data transfer operations, especially if the BotCharacterDistribution
    contains large collections or complex nested objects.
