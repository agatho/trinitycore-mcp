documentation:
  brief: Updates the evoker's augmentation buffs based on current spell availability
    and player state.
  description: The UpdateAugmentationBuffs method manages the application and removal
    of augmentation buffs for an Evoker AI character. It evaluates the current state
    of the evoker, including available spells, cooldowns, and combat conditions, to
    determine which augmentation effects should be active. This method is typically
    called during the AI update cycle to ensure that the evoker maintains optimal
    buff states according to game mechanics and class-specific rules. The method does
    not directly cast spells but rather manages the internal state of buffs and prepares
    the evoker for appropriate spell casting based on these buff conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateAugmentationBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Evoker's core AI behavior and should be called
    regularly during the AI update cycle. It relies on the evoker's internal spell
    tracking and state management to make decisions about buff application.
