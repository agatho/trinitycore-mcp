documentation:
  brief: Moves a GuildMgr object, transferring ownership of its resources to the new
    instance.
  description: The GuildMgr move constructor transfers all resources from the source
    GuildMgr object to the destination object. This operation is typically used when
    moving objects between scopes or containers, such as when storing a GuildMgr in
    a container that requires move semantics. The source object becomes invalid after
    the move and should not be used. This constructor is part of the C++ standard
    library's move semantics implementation for the GuildMgr class.
  parameters: []
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Moving a GuildMgr instance into a container
    code: 'std::vector<GuildMgr> guilds;

      GuildMgr sourceGuildMgr;

      guilds.push_back(std::move(sourceGuildMgr)); // Move constructor called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the compiler during move
    operations. Developers should be aware that after a move, the source object's
    state is undefined and any attempt to use it may result in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not use the source object after moving it. Using a moved-from GuildMgr
    object can lead to crashes or data corruption. Ensure all references to the original
    object are invalidated after the move operation.
