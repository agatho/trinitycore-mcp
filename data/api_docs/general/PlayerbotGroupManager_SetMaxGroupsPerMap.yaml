  method: SetMaxGroupsPerMap
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::SetMaxGroupsPerMap(uint32 mapId, uint32 maxGroups)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of player bot groups allowed per map.
  description: This method configures the maximum number of player bot groups that
    can exist on a specific map at any given time. It is used to control resource
    usage and balance gameplay by limiting how many bot groups can be active in a
    particular zone or instance. The setting applies globally for the specified map
    ID and affects all players within that map's context. This method does not validate
    the input values, so callers should ensure that maxGroups is a reasonable number
    to avoid performance issues or unexpected behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map for which to set the maximum bot
      groups. Must correspond to a valid map in the game world.
  - name: maxGroups
    description: The maximum number of player bot groups allowed on the specified
      map. Should be a non-negative integer; values of zero effectively disable bot
      groups on that map.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Maximum Groups for Eastern Kingdoms
    code: PlayerbotGroupManager::SetMaxGroupsPerMap(0, 10); // Set max 10 bot groups
      on Eastern Kingdoms (map ID 0)
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bot Groups in Specific Instance
    code: PlayerbotGroupManager::SetMaxGroupsPerMap(1234, 0); // Disable bot groups
      in instance with map ID 1234
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global configuration value that affects all players
    on the specified map. Changes take effect immediately for new group creations
    but may not affect existing groups already formed. The implementation likely uses
    internal caching or lookup tables to store these per-map limits, so frequent changes
    could impact performance.
  warnings: Setting maxGroups to an extremely high value can lead to resource exhaustion
    and server instability. Setting it to zero disables bot groups on that map entirely,
    which may break certain bot-related gameplay features. Ensure that the mapId provided
    is valid to avoid undefined behavior.
