  method: SetGOTarget
  signature: void SpellCastTargets::SetGOTarget(GameObject * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the game object target for a spell cast.
  description: The SetGOTarget method assigns a GameObject pointer as the target for
    a spell being cast. This method is typically used within the context of spell
    casting mechanics in TrinityCore to specify which game object (such as a door,
    chest, or trap) should be affected by the spell. The target GameObject must be
    valid and within the appropriate range for the spell to be cast successfully.
    This method updates the internal target tracking state of the SpellCastTargets
    object.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the GameObject that will serve as the target for the
      spell. Must not be null and must represent a valid game object in the world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a GameObject Target for Spell Casting
    code: "GameObject* go = player->FindNearestGameObject(GO_ID_SOME_DOOR, 5.0f);\n\
      if (go)\n{\n    SpellCastTargets targets;\n    targets.SetGOTarget(go);\n  \
      \  // Proceed with spell casting using these targets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate that the target GameObject is within range
    or valid for the specific spell being cast. It simply sets the target reference.
    The actual validation and targeting logic is handled by higher-level systems in
    the spell casting pipeline.
