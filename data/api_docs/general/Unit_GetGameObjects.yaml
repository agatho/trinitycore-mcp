  class: Unit
  method: GetGameObjects
  signature: int Unit::GetGameObjects(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of game objects associated with a specific spell.
  description: This method retrieves the count of game objects that are linked to
    a particular spell ID within the unit's context. It is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework for managing spell-related game object interactions,
    particularly when dealing with spell effects that summon or create game objects.
    The method provides a way to determine how many game objects are currently active
    or associated with a given spell, which can be crucial for gameplay mechanics
    such as spell cooldowns, summoning effects, or object management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of game objects associated with
    the specified spell ID. A value of 0 indicates no game objects are linked to the
    spell, while positive values indicate the number of active game objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int count = unit->GetGameObjects(12345);\nif (count > 0)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ game object interactions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell-related game object
    management. Performance considerations include checking for active game objects
    before performing operations, as the method may involve iterating through a list
    of game objects associated with the spell. Thread safety depends on how the unit's
    game object list is managed internally.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with spell
    effects that might modify or remove game objects during execution. The return
    value may not reflect immediate changes if game objects are removed or added after
    the method call.
