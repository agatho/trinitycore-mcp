  class: ArcaneChargeTracker
  method: GetCharges
  signature: uint32 ArcaneChargeTracker::GetCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of arcane charges stored in the ArcaneChargeTracker
    instance.
  description: The GetCharges method returns the count of arcane charges currently
    held by the ArcaneChargeTracker. This tracker is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's spell systems, particularly for abilities that accumulate
    arcane energy over time or through specific actions. The returned value represents
    how many charges are available for use, which may affect spell casting or ability
    activation. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely a getter
    function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of arcane charges currently stored
    in the tracker. Returns zero if no charges are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ArcaneChargeTracker tracker;\nuint32 charges = tracker.GetCharges();\n\
      if (charges > 0)\n{\n    // Use arcane charges for spell casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Logic
    code: "class ArcaneBlastSpell\n{\npublic:\n    void CastSpell(ArcaneChargeTracker&\
      \ tracker)\n    {\n        uint32 charges = tracker.GetCharges();\n        if\
      \ (charges >= 3)\n        {\n            // Cast the powerful arcane blast with\
      \ full charges\n            DoArcaneBlastDamage(charges);\n        }\n     \
      \   else\n        {\n            // Cast a weaker version or fail\n        \
      \    SendSpellFailed(SPELL_FAILED_NOT_ENOUGH_POWER);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const and does not alter the internal state of the ArcaneChargeTracker.
    It's safe to call from any thread context, assuming the underlying data structure
    is properly synchronized. The returned value should be treated as a snapshot at
    the time of invocation.
  warnings: Ensure that the ArcaneChargeTracker instance has been properly initialized
    before calling this method. Calling GetCharges on an uninitialized or destroyed
    tracker may result in undefined behavior.
