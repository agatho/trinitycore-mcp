  class: LoSUtils
  method: IsAreaClear
  signature: bool LoSUtils::IsAreaClear(const int & center, float radius, Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a circular area around a given center point is clear of obstacles
    in the specified map.
  description: The IsAreaClear method determines whether a circular region defined
    by a center coordinate and radius is completely free of solid obstacles within
    the provided Map. This utility function is commonly used in game mechanics such
    as spell casting, ability targeting, or AI pathfinding to verify line-of-sight
    or area clearance before executing actions. The method performs a raycast-based
    check across the specified area to ensure no impassable terrain blocks the region.
    It returns true if the entire area is clear and false if any part of it is obstructed.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the circular area to be checked, represented
      as an integer identifier (likely a grid or cell coordinate).
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular area in world units (typically meters)
      that will be evaluated for clearance.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the area clearance check is performed.
      Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the entire circular area defined by center and radius is
    clear of obstacles on the specified map; returns false if any portion of the area
    is obstructed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spell area clearance
    code: "if (LoSUtils::IsAreaClear(spellCenter, spellRadius, currentMap)) {\n  \
      \  // Proceed with spell casting\n    CastSpell();\n} else {\n    // Notify\
      \ player that area is obstructed\n    SendErrorMessage(\"Area is blocked.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsAreaClear for AI pathfinding decision
    code: "float searchRadius = 5.0f;\nif (LoSUtils::IsAreaClear(aiPosition, searchRadius,\
      \ aiMap)) {\n    // Safe to proceed with movement\n    MoveToTarget();\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Find alternative route\n    FindAlternativePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying map's collision detection system. Performance
    may vary depending on map complexity and the number of obstacles in the area.
    The center parameter is expected to be a valid grid coordinate, typically derived
    from world coordinates via conversion functions.
  warnings: Ensure that the map pointer passed is valid and not null; passing an invalid
    map can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also note that this function only
    checks for static geometry and may not account for dynamic objects like moving
    creatures or temporary barriers.
