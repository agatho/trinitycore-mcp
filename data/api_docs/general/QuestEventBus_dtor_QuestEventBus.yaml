documentation:
  brief: Destroys the QuestEventBus instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The QuestEventBus destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all internal resources and data structures associated with the event bus. This
    includes releasing any allocated memory, unregistering event listeners, and ensuring
    no dangling references remain. The destructor is automatically invoked when a
    QuestEventBus object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that
    the event system remains stable and prevents memory leaks during quest-related
    event handling within the TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of QuestEventBus instance
    code: 'QuestEventBus* bus = new QuestEventBus();

      // ... use the bus ...

      delete bus; // Triggers ~QuestEventBus()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It is important to ensure that all event handlers are properly unregistered
    before destruction to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
