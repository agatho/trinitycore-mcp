documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GameObjectScript with the specified name for use in World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore scripting system.
  description: The GameObjectScript constructor initializes a new game object script
    instance with a given name. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore
    framework to register and manage custom game object behaviors. The name parameter
    serves as an identifier that allows the script to be retrieved and executed when
    specific events occur related to game objects. It's important to note that this
    constructor is part of the base GameObjectScript class and should be called during
    script initialization or registration. This method does not return any value but
    sets up internal state necessary for script execution within the game engine.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic GameObjectScript Initialization
    code: "class MyGameObjectScript : public GameObjectScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyGameObjectScript()\
      \ : GameObjectScript(\"MyCustomGameObject\") {}\n    // Other methods...\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called from derived class constructors to register
    the script with the TrinityCore system. The name parameter must be unique to avoid
    conflicts in the script registry. This method should only be invoked during object
    construction and not at runtime.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on base GameObjectScript instances;
    it should only be used within derived class constructors. Ensure that the name
    parameter is a valid, non-empty string to prevent registration issues.
