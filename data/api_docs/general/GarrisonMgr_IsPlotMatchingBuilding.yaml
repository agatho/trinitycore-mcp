api:
  class: GarrisonMgr
  method: IsPlotMatchingBuilding
  signature: bool GarrisonMgr::IsPlotMatchingBuilding(uint32 garrPlotId, uint32 garrBuildingId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified garrison plot matches the given building type.
  description: The IsPlotMatchingBuilding method determines if a garrison plot identified
    by its unique ID can accommodate a specific building type. This functionality
    is essential for validating building placements within the garrison system, ensuring
    that only appropriate buildings are placed on designated plots. The method performs
    internal lookups against game data to verify compatibility between the plot and
    building IDs. It's commonly used during building placement logic and garrison
    management operations.
  parameters:
  - name: garrPlotId
    description: The unique identifier of the garrison plot to check for compatibility
      with the building.
  - name: garrBuildingId
    description: The unique identifier of the building type being checked against
      the plot.
  returns: Returns true if the specified building can be placed on the given plot,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the building type is compatible with the
    plot's requirements and constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sGarrisonMgr->IsPlotMatchingBuilding(123, 456)) {\n    // Building\
      \ 456 can be placed on plot 123\n    printf(\"Valid placement\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Invalid placement\n    printf(\"Invalid placement\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Building Placement Logic
    code: "void HandleBuildingPlacement(Player* player, uint32 plotId, uint32 buildingId)\
      \ {\n    if (sGarrisonMgr->IsPlotMatchingBuilding(plotId, buildingId)) {\n \
      \       // Proceed with placing the building\n        PlaceBuilding(player,\
      \ plotId, buildingId);\n    } else {\n        // Notify player of invalid placement\n\
      \        player->SendSystemMessage(\"This building cannot be placed on this\
      \ plot.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal garrison data structures and should only be
    called when garrison systems are fully initialized. The method performs fast lookups
    using cached data, making it suitable for frequent calls during gameplay operations.
  warnings: Ensure that both plotId and buildingId are valid identifiers before calling
    this method, as invalid IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect return
    values.
