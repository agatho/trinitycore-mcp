  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleGuildReplaceGuildMaster
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleGuildReplaceGuildMaster(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildReplaceGuildMaster
    & replaceGuildMaster)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the client request to replace the current guild master with another
    player.
  description: This method processes a packet sent by a player who wishes to transfer
    guild leadership to another member. It validates that the requesting player has
    sufficient permissions (typically requires guild master status), ensures the target
    player is a valid guild member, and then performs the guild master transfer operation.
    The method updates internal guild data structures and sends appropriate responses
    back to the client. This functionality is part of the World of Warcraft guild
    management system within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: replaceGuildMaster
    description: A packet containing the target player's name who will become the
      new guild master.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a command handler
    code: "void HandleGuildMasterTransferCommand(WorldSession* session, const std::string&\
      \ targetName)\n{\n    WorldPackets::Guild::GuildReplaceGuildMaster packet;\n\
      \    packet.NewGuildMaster = targetName;\n    session->HandleGuildReplaceGuildMaster(packet);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the calling player has already been validated for guild
    master privileges. The actual guild data update and synchronization with other
    players is handled internally by TrinityCore after this method completes.
  warnings: Improper validation of user permissions before calling this method can
    lead to unauthorized guild leadership transfers. Ensure that only authorized players
    (typically guild masters) are allowed to invoke this functionality.
