  signature: bool DefensiveBehaviorManager::IsDamageMostlyPhysical() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the majority of damage dealt by the unit is physical in
    nature.
  description: The IsDamageMostlyPhysical method evaluates the damage type distribution
    of the unit controlled by the DefensiveBehaviorManager. It returns true if the
    majority of the damage output is classified as physical damage, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is commonly used in AI behavior logic to make decisions based
    on the unit's primary damage type, such as determining appropriate defensive strategies
    or spell selection. The method considers all damage sources that contribute to
    the unit's overall damage output, including melee attacks, abilities, and any
    other damage-generating mechanics. It does not account for damage over time effects
    or indirect damage sources unless they are part of the core damage calculation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the majority of the unit's damage is physical; returns
    false if the majority is non-physical (e.g., magical, holy, nature, fire, frost,
    shadow, etc.).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (defensiveManager.IsDamageMostlyPhysical()) {\n    // Apply physical\
      \ damage mitigation strategies\n    unit->AddAura(SPELL_PHYSICAL_PROTECTION);\n\
      } else {\n    // Apply magical damage mitigation strategies\n    unit->AddAura(SPELL_MAGICAL_PROTECTION);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a weighted analysis of the unit's damage types,
    potentially considering attack speed, weapon type, and ability usage patterns.
    It may be called frequently during AI decision-making cycles, so performance should
    be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: The method assumes that the unit's damage type distribution is stable
    and representative of its current combat behavior. If the unit's damage type changes
    dynamically (e.g., through buffs or debuffs), this method may not reflect the
    updated state immediately without a recalculation.
