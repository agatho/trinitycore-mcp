  signature: uint32 Quest::GetRewMailSenderEntry() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the mail sender entry ID for quest rewards.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier of the mail sender associated
    with the quest reward. It is used to determine which NPC or object sends the reward
    mail when a player completes a quest. The returned value typically corresponds
    to an entry in the MailStationery table or similar database structure, representing
    the sender's identity for quest reward mail delivery. This method is essential
    for proper quest reward handling and ensures correct mail delivery mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the mail sender entry ID, which identifies
    the NPC or object that sends the quest reward mail. This value typically corresponds
    to an entry in the MailStationery table and may be used for validation or lookup
    purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 senderEntry = quest->GetRewMailSenderEntry();\n// senderEntry now\
      \ contains the mail sender ID\nif (senderEntry > 0)\n{\n    // Process the mail\
      \ sender entry\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest reward methods
    to properly configure reward mail delivery. The returned value should match database
    entries for mail senders, and developers should verify that it corresponds to
    valid NPC entries in the database.
  warnings: This method should not be called during quest initialization or before
    quest completion, as it may return invalid values if the quest hasn't been properly
    initialized. Also note that this method may return 0 if no mail sender is configured
    for the specific quest.
