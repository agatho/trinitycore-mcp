  class: ClassAI
  method: HasAura
  signature: bool ClassAI::HasAura(int spellId, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the AI-controlled unit has a specific aura applied.
  description: The HasAura method determines whether the ClassAI instance's associated
    unit currently has a specified aura active. This is commonly used in AI behavior
    logic to make decisions based on the presence or absence of buffs, debuffs, or
    other magical effects. The method performs a lookup within the unit's current
    aura application list and returns true if the specified spell ID is found, false
    otherwise. It can optionally provide information about the target of the aura
    through the optional target parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell aura to check for. This corresponds
      to the SpellID used in the game's spell database.
  - name: target
    description: Optional pointer to an integer that will be filled with the target
      GUID of the aura if found. Can be nullptr if the target information is not needed.
  returns: Returns true if the specified aura (spell) is currently active on the unit,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Check
    code: "if (ai->HasAura(12345)) {\n    // Unit has aura with spell ID 12345\n \
      \   // Perform some action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Aura Check with Target Information
    code: "int targetGuid = 0;\nif (ai->HasAura(67890, &targetGuid)) {\n    // Aura\
      \ found; targetGuid contains the GUID of the aura's target\n    // Use targetGuid\
      \ for further logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the current state of auras applied to the unit. Auras
    that are removed or expire during execution will not be reflected in subsequent
    calls unless the AI system is updated accordingly. The method does not account
    for aura stacking or multiple applications of the same spell.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId passed is valid and corresponds to an actual aura
    in the game's database, otherwise behavior may be undefined. Be cautious when
    using the target parameter as it may contain stale data if the aura has recently
    been removed.
