  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ProcessQuestTurnInResponse(Player * bot, uint32 questId,
    bool wasSuccessful)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the processing of a quest turn-in response for a player character.
  description: The ProcessQuestTurnInResponse method is responsible for managing the
    outcome of a quest completion attempt by a player. It takes the player object,
    the quest identifier, and a success flag to determine how to proceed with quest-related
    actions such as updating quest status, rewarding items or experience, and notifying
    the client of the result. This method is typically invoked after a player has
    submitted a quest, either through interaction with an NPC or by turning in required
    items. The method ensures that appropriate game state changes occur based on whether
    the turn-in was successful or not.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who completed
      the quest. This player must be valid and currently in the game world.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier for the quest being turned in. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the quest turn-in was successful
      (true) or failed (false). Determines subsequent actions such as reward distribution
      or error handling.
  returns: null

    code: "void HandleQuestTurnIn(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    QuestTurnIn::ProcessQuestTurnInResponse(player,\
      \ questId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Failed Quest Turn-In
    code: "void HandleFailedQuestTurnIn(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    QuestTurnIn::ProcessQuestTurnInResponse(player,\
      \ questId, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player object is valid and not null.
    It relies on internal TrinityCore systems to manage quest state transitions and
    rewards. The method does not directly communicate with the client; instead, it
    triggers appropriate internal events that may result in UI updates or messages
    being sent to the player.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId corresponds to a valid quest in the database before
    calling this method. Passing an invalid questId may lead to undefined behavior
    or errors during quest processing.
