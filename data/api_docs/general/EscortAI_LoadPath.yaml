  class: EscortAI
  method: LoadPath
  signature: void EscortAI::LoadPath(int pathId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads a predefined path for the escort AI to follow.
  description: The LoadPath method initializes and loads a specific path identified
    by the given pathId into the EscortAI instance. This path defines the waypoints
    that the escorted NPC will follow during an escort quest. The method typically
    retrieves path data from the database or internal path tables and prepares the
    AI for movement along the defined route. It is commonly called during the initialization
    phase of an escort quest to set up the movement behavior before the escort begins.
  parameters:
  - name: pathId
    description: An integer identifier that specifies which predefined path to load.
      This ID corresponds to a path entry in the database or internal path definitions
      used by the EscortAI system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LoadPath
    code: "void OnQuestStart(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (quest->GetQuestId()\
      \ == 12345)\n    {\n        EscortAI* escort = new EscortAI(player);\n     \
      \   escort->LoadPath(54321); // Load path with ID 54321\n        escort->Start();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The pathId parameter must correspond to a valid path defined in the database
    or internal path system. If an invalid pathId is provided, the method may silently
    fail or result in unexpected behavior. The loaded path should contain at least
    two waypoints for meaningful movement.
