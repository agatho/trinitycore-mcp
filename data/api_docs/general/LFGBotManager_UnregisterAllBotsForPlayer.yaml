  method: UnregisterAllBotsForPlayer
  signature: void LFGBotManager::UnregisterAllBotsForPlayer(int humanGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Unregisters all bots associated with a specific player GUID from the LFG
    system.
  description: The UnregisterAllBotsForPlayer method removes all bot entries that
    are registered under the specified human player's GUID from the Looking For Group
    (LFG) system. This function is typically used when a player logs out or leaves
    a group, ensuring that any bot companions they had registered for LFG purposes
    are properly cleaned up. The method operates on the internal tracking structure
    of the LFGBotManager to invalidate all bot registrations tied to the given player
    identifier. It does not perform any validation on the GUID itself, assuming it
    refers to a valid player in the system.
  parameters:
  - name: humanGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the human player whose bots should
      be unregistered from LFG. This value must correspond to an existing player in
      the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Unregister all bots for a logged-out player
    code: 'LFGBotManager* lfgBotMgr = LFGBotManager::instance();

      uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      lfgBotMgr->UnregisterAllBotsForPlayer(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided GUID is valid and corresponds to a
    known player in the game. It does not check for the existence of the player or
    perform any database queries beyond internal tracking. The method may be called
    multiple times with the same GUID without side effects.
