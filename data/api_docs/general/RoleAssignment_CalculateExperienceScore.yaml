api:
  class: RoleAssignment
  method: CalculateExperienceScore
  signature: float RoleAssignment::CalculateExperienceScore(uint32 playerGuid, GroupRole
    role)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the experience score for a player based on their assigned
    group role.
  description: The CalculateExperienceScore method determines a numerical experience
    score for a given player based on their assigned group role within the game. This
    score is typically used to influence how experience points are distributed among
    group members, with different roles potentially receiving different multipliers
    or adjustments. The method likely considers factors such as the player's current
    level, role specialization, and group dynamics when computing this value. It serves
    as a core component in TrinityCore's group management and experience distribution
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player for whom the experience
      score is being calculated.
  - name: role
    description: The group role assigned to the player, which affects how their experience
      score is computed. Valid values are typically defined by the GroupRole enumeration.
  returns: A floating-point value representing the calculated experience score for
    the specified player and role. This value may be used as a multiplier or base
    value in experience point calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float score = roleAssignment->CalculateExperienceScore(12345, GroupRole::TANK);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Experience Distribution
    code: 'uint32 playerGuid = 67890;

      GroupRole role = GroupRole::HEALER;

      float experienceScore = roleAssignment->CalculateExperienceScore(playerGuid,
      role);

      // Apply score to experience distribution logic

      uint32 baseXP = 1000;

      uint32 finalXP = baseXP * experienceScore;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during group experience point distribution calculations.
    The exact formula used for computing the score may vary based on game balance
    settings or server configurations. It's important to note that this method does
    not modify any persistent data but rather computes a value for use in runtime
    calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that playerGuid and role parameters are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid inputs could lead to unexpected behavior or calculation errors.
    The returned score should be treated as a multiplier and validated to prevent
    division by zero or negative values in downstream experience calculations.
