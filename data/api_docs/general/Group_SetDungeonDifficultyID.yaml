  method: SetDungeonDifficultyID
  signature: void Group::SetDungeonDifficultyID(int difficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the dungeon difficulty ID for the group.
  description: The SetDungeonDifficultyID method configures the difficulty level for
    a group's dungeon instance. This method updates the internal difficulty setting
    that determines which version of the dungeon content players will encounter. The
    difficulty ID corresponds to predefined values used by the game's difficulty system,
    such as normal, heroic, or mythic modes. This setting affects all members of the
    group and is typically called when a group leader selects a specific difficulty
    for their dungeon run.
  parameters:
  - name: difficulty
    description: The difficulty ID to set for the group's dungeon instance. Valid
      values are typically 1-4 representing Normal, Heroic, Mythic, and other difficulty
      levels depending on the expansion and content type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Group to Heroic Difficulty
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetDungeonDifficultyID(1);\
      \ // Set to Heroic difficulty\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Group to Mythic Difficulty
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player->GetGUID()))\n\
      {\n    group->SetDungeonDifficultyID(3); // Set to Mythic difficulty\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called by the group leader or with appropriate
    permissions. The difficulty setting is immediately applied to all group members
    and affects future dungeon instances created by the group.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group that is already in a dungeon instance may
    not have immediate effect on existing encounters. Always verify the group's current
    state before changing difficulty settings.
