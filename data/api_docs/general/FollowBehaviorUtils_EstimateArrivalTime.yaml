  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: EstimateArrivalTime
  signature: float FollowBehaviorUtils::EstimateArrivalTime(Player * bot, const int
    & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Estimates the time it will take for a bot player to reach a specified destination.
  description: The EstimateArrivalTime method calculates and returns an estimated
    arrival time in seconds for a given bot player to reach a specific destination.
    This utility function is commonly used in AI behavior systems to determine how
    long it will take for a bot to move to a target location, which helps in planning
    subsequent actions such as pathfinding, movement synchronization, or decision-making
    based on timing. The method takes into account the player's current position and
    movement speed to compute this estimate. It assumes that the destination is valid
    and accessible within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose arrival time
      is being estimated.
  - name: destination
    description: Integer identifier representing the destination point, likely a waypoint
      or location index within the game world.
  returns: A float value representing the estimated time in seconds for the bot to
    reach the specified destination. Returns 0.0 if the destination is invalid or
    unreachable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float arrivalTime = FollowBehaviorUtils::EstimateArrivalTime(botPlayer,
      12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Arrival Time for Decision Making
    code: "float timeToDestination = FollowBehaviorUtils::EstimateArrivalTime(playerBot,\
      \ targetWaypoint);\nif (timeToDestination > 10.0f) {\n    // Perform an action\
      \ that takes longer than 10 seconds\n    playerBot->SetFacingTo(targetPosition);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's current movement speed and position to calculate
    the estimated time. It does not account for dynamic obstacles or changes in terrain
    during travel. The destination parameter is expected to be a valid identifier
    within the AI system's context.
  warnings: Ensure that the destination ID passed to this function corresponds to
    an actual navigable point in the game world, otherwise the result may be inaccurate
    or misleading. Do not use this method for real-time pathfinding decisions without
    considering its limitations.
