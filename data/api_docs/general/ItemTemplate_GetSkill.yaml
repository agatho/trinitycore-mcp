  method: GetSkill
  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetSkill() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the required skill level for using the item.
  description: The GetSkill method retrieves the minimum skill level required to use
    or equip the item. This value is typically associated with items that require
    specific skills such as weapons, armor, or tools. For example, a weapon requiring
    a certain proficiency in a particular skill will return that skill's level threshold.
    The returned value corresponds to the skill ID defined in the game's database,
    which can be used to check if a player has sufficient skill to use the item. If
    no skill requirement is set for the item, this method may return zero or an invalid
    skill identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the required skill ID. This corresponds to
    the skill type needed to use the item. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    no skill requirement exists for the item.
  examples:
  - title: Check if player meets skill requirement
    code: "uint32 requiredSkill = itemTemplate->GetSkill();\nif (requiredSkill > 0)\n\
      {\n    uint32 playerSkill = player->GetSkillValue(requiredSkill);\n    if (playerSkill\
      \ < 1)\n        SendNotification(\"You do not meet the skill requirement for\
      \ this item.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with player skill checks during
    item usage or equipping. The returned value should be validated against valid
    skill IDs from the game's database to ensure correct behavior.
