  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: ValidateBid
  signature: bool BlackMarketEntry::ValidateBid(int bid) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a bid amount is acceptable for the black market item.
  description: The ValidateBid method checks whether a given bid value meets the requirements
    for placing a bid on a black market item. It ensures that the bid is not less
    than the minimum required bid and adheres to any other game-defined constraints
    such as bid increments or maximum allowable values. This validation prevents invalid
    bids from being processed, maintaining the integrity of the black market auction
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bid amount is valid according to the black market item's
    rules; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bid Validation
    code: "BlackMarketEntry entry;\nint bidAmount = 1000;\nbool isValid = entry.ValidateBid(bidAmount);\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with placing the bid\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal black market item data such as minimum
    bid, bid increment, and current highest bid to perform validation. It may also
    consider the player's account status or auction house restrictions.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid bid will always result in a successful auction;
    additional checks like item availability and player permissions might be required
    before finalizing an auction.
