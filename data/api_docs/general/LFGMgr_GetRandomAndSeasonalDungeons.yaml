  signature: LfgDungeonSet LFGMgr::GetRandomAndSeasonalDungeons(uint8 level, uint8
    expansion, uint32 contentTuningReplacementConditionMask)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a set of random and seasonal dungeons available for the specified
    player level, expansion, and content tuning conditions.
  description: The GetRandomAndSeasonalDungeons method returns a collection of dungeon
    entries that are marked as either random or seasonal, based on the provided player
    level, expansion, and content tuning replacement condition mask. This method is
    typically used in the LFG (Looking for Group) system to determine which dungeons
    can be selected by players when they are looking for a group. The returned set
    includes all applicable dungeons that match the criteria, such as being appropriate
    for the player's level range and matching the expansion requirements. Dungeons
    returned may include both traditional random dungeons and seasonal events like
    Heroic versions or special holiday content.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The player's current level, used to filter dungeons that are appropriate
      for this level range.
  - name: expansion
    description: The expansion ID indicating which expansion the player is playing
      in (e.g., 0 = Vanilla, 1 = The Burning Crusade, etc.).
  - name: contentTuningReplacementConditionMask
    description: A bitmask used to filter dungeons based on content tuning replacement
      conditions, such as specific seasonal events or versioning.
  returns: A LfgDungeonSet containing all random and seasonal dungeon entries that
    match the provided level, expansion, and content tuning criteria. The set may
    be empty if no matching dungeons are found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve available random and seasonal dungeons for a level 80 player in
      the Burning Crusade expansion
    code: LfgDungeonSet dungeons = sLFGMgr->GetRandomAndSeasonalDungeons(80, 1, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Filter random and seasonal dungeons for a level 70 player in Shadowlands
      with specific content tuning conditions
    code: LfgDungeonSet dungeons = sLFGMgr->GetRandomAndSeasonalDungeons(70, 6, 0x10);
      // Example mask for seasonal events
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and is commonly used during group matching
    or dungeon selection processes. It filters dungeons based on level, expansion,
    and content tuning conditions. The returned set is not sorted and may include
    both normal and heroic versions of the same dungeon depending on the input parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided level and expansion values are valid for the
    current game version to avoid unexpected filtering behavior. The contentTuningReplacementConditionMask
    must be properly constructed to match expected conditions or it may result in
    an empty set.
