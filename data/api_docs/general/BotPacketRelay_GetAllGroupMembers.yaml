api:
  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: GetAllGroupMembers
  signature: int BotPacketRelay::GetAllGroupMembers(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all group members for a specified bot player.
  description: The GetAllGroupMembers method retrieves and returns the number of players
    currently in the same group as the provided bot player. This function is typically
    used within the TrinityCore bot system to manage group-based interactions, such
    as coordinating actions or distributing loot among group members. It accesses
    the internal group data structure associated with the bot's current group membership
    and counts the total number of valid group members, including the bot itself if
    it is in a group. The method assumes that the provided player object represents
    a valid bot instance within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose group members
      are to be retrieved. This parameter must not be null and should reference a
      valid bot instance in the game world.
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of group members found for
    the specified bot. Returns 0 if the bot is not in a group or if no valid group
    members are found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get group member count
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot\nint memberCount\
      \ = BotPacketRelay::GetAllGroupMembers(myBot);\nif (memberCount > 0) {\n   \
      \ // Proceed with group-based logic\n    printf(\"Bot is in a group with %d\
      \ members\\n\", memberCount);\n} else {\n    // Handle case where bot is not\
      \ in a group\n    printf(\"Bot is not in any group\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal group management system of TrinityCore
    and assumes that the provided player object has valid group membership data. The
    returned count includes the bot itself if it is part of the group. Performance
    may be affected in large groups due to iteration over all group members.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is a valid, non-null pointer to avoid undefined
    behavior. This method should not be called on players who are not bots or who
    have not been initialized properly within the game world.
