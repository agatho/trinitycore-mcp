  - title: Displaying Summary in Game Console
    code: "void DisplayBotSummary() {\n    BotLevelManager* manager = BotLevelManager::GetSingleton();\n\
      \    if (manager) {\n        std::string summary = manager->GetSummary();\n\

  notes: This method performs string concatenation operations and may have performance
    implications when called frequently. The output format is designed for readability
    rather than parsing, so it should not be used for programmatic data extraction.
