  class: Creature
  method: SetGossipMenuId
  signature: void Creature::SetGossipMenuId(uint32 gossipMenuId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the gossip menu ID for a creature to control its interaction with players.
  description: This method assigns a specific gossip menu ID to a Creature instance,
    which determines the menu that will be displayed when players interact with the
    creature. The gossip menu ID is used to reference predefined gossip entries in
    the database, allowing developers to customize the dialogue options and interaction
    behavior of NPCs. This method is typically used in conjunction with other gossip-related
    functions to create complex NPC interactions and quest systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = (Creature*)player->GetNPCIfPresent(12345);

      creature->SetGossipMenuId(1001);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->SetGossipMenuId(1001);

      creature->AddGossipItem(0, 1, 1001, 0);

      creature->SendGossipMenu(1001, player);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly send the gossip menu to the player; it only
    sets the ID. The actual sending of the menu requires additional methods like SendGossipMenu()
    and AddGossipItem(). This method is commonly used in quest scripts and NPC interaction
    handlers.
  warnings: This method should be called before calling SendGossipMenu(), otherwise
    the gossip menu may not display correctly. Also, ensure that the gossipMenuId
    corresponds to valid entries in the gossip_menu_id table of the database.
