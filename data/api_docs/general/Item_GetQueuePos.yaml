  signature: uint16 Item::GetQueuePos() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the queue position of the item in the player's inventory.
  description: The GetQueuePos method retrieves the position of an item within the
    player's inventory queue, which is used to determine the order in which items
    are processed during various game mechanics such as item evaluation, auction house
    operations, or character inventory management. This method is particularly useful
    for identifying items that are currently being processed or queued for specific
    actions, and it helps maintain proper item ordering in the system. The returned
    value represents a zero-based index indicating where the item sits within the
    player's inventory queue.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 representing the queue position of the item within the
    player's inventory. This value indicates the index position of the item in the
    queue, with 0 being the first item and higher values representing later items
    in the queue sequence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 queuePos = item->GetQueuePos();\nif (queuePos > 0)\n{\n    // Item\
      \ is not at the beginning of the queue\n    // Do something with the queue position\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory-related
    methods to track item positions and ensure proper processing order. It's important
    to note that this value may change depending on how items are added or removed
    from the queue, especially during dynamic inventory operations.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining item identification or
    unique GUIDs; it only represents the queue position within the player's inventory.
    Be cautious when using this value in scenarios where item order matters, as incorrect
    usage could lead to processing errors or misalignment of items.
