  class: ConversationAI
  method: GetId
  signature: uint32 ConversationAI::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the conversation instance.
  description: The GetId method returns the unique 32-bit identifier associated with
    a specific ConversationAI instance. This ID is used internally by the TrinityCore
    framework to track and manage conversation states, dialogue trees, and related
    NPC interactions. The returned value typically corresponds to the conversation's
    entry in the database or its assigned runtime identifier within the AI system.
    This method is commonly called during conversation initialization, state transitions,
    or when linking conversation events to specific quest or NPC triggers.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the ConversationAI
    instance. This ID is guaranteed to be non-zero for valid conversation instances
    and is used internally by the core framework for identification and management
    purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 conversationId = conversation->GetId();\nif (conversationId != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with conversation logic using the ID\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Conversation ID: %u\", conversationId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ID for Database Lookups
    code: "uint32 id = conversation->GetId();\nif (id > 0)\n{\n    // Example of using\
      \ the ID to query conversation data\n    QueryResult result = WorldDatabase.Query(\"\
      SELECT * FROM conversation_template WHERE ID = {}\", id);\n    if (result)\n\
      \    {\n        // Process conversation template data\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the ConversationAI
    instance state. The returned ID should be treated as immutable and consistent
    throughout the lifetime of the conversation object. This method may return zero
    for invalid or uninitialized conversation instances.
