  method: GetChanceAgainst
  signature: float ArenaTeam::GetChanceAgainst(uint32 ownRating, uint32 opponentRating)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the probability of an arena team winning against another team
    based on their ratings.
  description: The GetChanceAgainst method computes the likelihood that one arena
    team will defeat another team in a match, using the Elo rating system. This calculation
    is fundamental to determining match outcomes and reward distribution in World
    of Warcraft's arena gameplay. The method takes two parameters representing the
    ratings of the current team and the opponent team, respectively. It returns a
    float value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates a 0% chance of winning and
    1.0 indicates a 100% chance of winning. This function is typically used internally
    by the arena system to determine match results and adjust ratings after battles.
  parameters:
  - name: ownRating
    description: The Elo rating of the current arena team. This value represents the
      team's relative strength in the arena system.
  - name: opponentRating
    description: The Elo rating of the opposing arena team. This value represents
      the opponent team's relative strength in the arena system.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the probability that the
    current team will win against the opponent team. A value closer to 1.0 indicates
    a higher chance of victory, while a value closer to 0.0 indicates a lower chance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float chance = arenaTeam->GetChanceAgainst(1500, 1600);

      // Returns approximately 0.359, indicating a 35.9% chance of winning'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Team Strengths
    code: "uint32 myRating = arenaTeam->GetRating();\nuint32 opponentRating = otherArenaTeam->GetRating();\n\
      float winChance = arenaTeam->GetChanceAgainst(myRating, opponentRating);\nif\
      \ (winChance > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Team is favored to win\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Team\
      \ is underdog\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements the standard Elo rating calculation formula, which
    assumes that the difference in ratings between two teams determines their relative
    chances of winning. The implementation may include adjustments for team size (e.g.,
    2v2, 3v3, 5v5) and other game-specific modifiers. This function is called frequently
    during arena matchmaking and battle processing.
  warnings: The method does not validate input parameters for rating values. Extremely
    high or low ratings could produce unexpected results due to floating-point precision
    limitations. Ensure that both ratings are valid before calling this method to
    avoid incorrect probability calculations.
