  class: BotLevelManager
  method: SetVerboseLogging
  signature: void BotLevelManager::SetVerboseLogging(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables verbose logging for bot level management operations.
  description: The SetVerboseLogging method controls whether detailed logging information
    is generated during bot level management processes. When enabled, this setting
    will output additional debug information to the console or log files, which can
    be useful for troubleshooting and monitoring bot behavior. This functionality
    is typically used in development environments or when diagnosing issues with bot
    leveling mechanics. The change takes effect immediately and affects all subsequent
    bot level management operations until the setting is changed again.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean flag that determines whether verbose logging should be
      activated (true) or deactivated (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Verbose Logging
    code: 'BotLevelManager* levelManager = BotLevelManager::GetInstance();

      levelManager->SetVerboseLogging(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Verbose Logging
    code: 'BotLevelManager* levelManager = BotLevelManager::GetInstance();

      levelManager->SetVerboseLogging(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the input parameter. The logging
    state change is immediate and affects all future operations within the current
    session. Verbose logging may impact performance in high-frequency scenarios due
    to increased output generation.
