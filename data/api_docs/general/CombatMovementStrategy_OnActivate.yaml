  class: CombatMovementStrategy

  signature: void CombatMovementStrategy::OnActivate(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat movement behavior for a bot AI instance
  description: The OnActivate method is called when the CombatMovementStrategy becomes
    active for a bot AI instance. This method sets up the necessary state and configurations
    required for the bot to engage in combat movement patterns, including establishing
    target tracking, pathfinding parameters, and movement restrictions. The method
    ensures that the bot's AI is properly configured to handle combat-related movement
    decisions such as pursuit, flanking, or retreat behaviors based on the current
    tactical situation.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that this strategy is being activated
      for. Must not be null and should represent a valid bot AI context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activating Combat Movement Strategy
    code: "void example() {\n    BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();\n    CombatMovementStrategy\
      \ strategy;\n    strategy.OnActivate(botAI);\n    // Bot AI is now configured\
      \ for combat movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore AI system
    when switching between different behavior strategies. It should not be called
    directly unless implementing custom AI logic. The method assumes that the provided
    BotAI instance has already been initialized with valid player and unit references.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null BotAI pointer as it will likely cause
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the AI instance is properly initialized
    before activation to avoid runtime errors during combat movement execution.
