documentation:
  brief: Updates the AI behavior of a bot character based on elapsed time and current
    game state
  description: The UpdateAI method is responsible for processing and executing the
    artificial intelligence logic for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework.
    It is called periodically by the game loop to handle bot decision-making, movement,
    combat actions, and other AI-related behaviors. The method takes a time delta
    parameter that represents the milliseconds elapsed since the last update, allowing
    the AI to perform time-sensitive operations such as cooldown management, target
    selection, and action timing. This method is typically invoked automatically by
    the core game engine and should not be called directly by external code unless
    specifically required for custom bot behavior implementations.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The number of milliseconds elapsed since the last AI update. This
      value is used to calculate time-based AI behaviors such as spell cooldowns,
      movement timing, and reaction delays.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    // ... other processing\
      \ ...\n    botAI->UpdateAI(diff);\n    // ... more processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom AI update with time tracking
    code: "class CustomBotAI : public BotAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        BotAI::UpdateAI(diff); // Call parent implementation\n\
      \        \n        // Custom time-based logic\n        if (m_updateTimer <=\
      \ 0)\n        {\n            DoCustomBehavior();\n            m_updateTimer\
      \ = 1000; // Reset timer\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            m_updateTimer\
      \ -= diff;\n        }\n    }\nprivate:\n    uint32 m_updateTimer = 0;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update cycle and should not block or perform
    long-running operations. The 'diff' parameter represents real-time elapsed milliseconds,
    which may vary between different server loads and client configurations. Implementations
    should be optimized for performance as this method is called frequently during
    active gameplay.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the game loop context as
    it expects valid time delta values. Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking
    operations within this method to prevent frame rate drops or AI lag.
