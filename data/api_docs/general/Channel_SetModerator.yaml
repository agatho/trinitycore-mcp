documentation:
  brief: Sets a player as a moderator in the channel
  description: The SetModerator method assigns moderator privileges to a specified
    player within a channel. This method is typically used by channel owners or existing
    moderators to promote other players to moderator status, granting them additional
    permissions such as kicking members, muting users, and managing channel settings.
    The method operates on the channel's internal data structures to update the player's
    role and broadcasts the change to all channel members. It requires proper authentication
    and authorization checks to ensure only authorized individuals can modify channel
    moderation status.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the moderator who is granting
      moderator privileges. This parameter must be a valid player instance with appropriate
      permissions to modify channel membership.
  - name: newname
    description: String containing the name of the player to be promoted to moderator
      status. The target player must be currently in the channel for this operation
      to succeed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Promote Player to Moderator
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player);\nif (channel)\n\
      {\n    channel->SetModerator(player, \"NewModerator\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal channel membership lists and may send
    network packets to inform all connected clients about the role change. The implementation
    probably includes validation checks for player existence in the channel and permission
    verification.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player pointer or non-existent channel
    name will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that both the moderator
    and target player are valid members of the channel before calling this method.
