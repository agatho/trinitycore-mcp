  signature: bool BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot world session manager is enabled.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
    system is currently active and functional within the TrinityCore server environment.
    This flag typically controls whether bot-related functionality, such as automated
    player behavior or AI-controlled characters, is allowed to operate. The method
    performs a simple boolean check on an internal state variable that reflects the
    overall enablement status of the bot management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot world session manager is enabled and operational;
    otherwise returns false if it is disabled or not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check bot system status
    code: "if (BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::instance()->IsEnabled()) {\n    // Bot\
      \ functionality is active\n    sLog->outString(\"Bots are enabled\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Bot functionality is disabled\n    sLog->outString(\"Bots are disabled\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other bot management functions
    to ensure that operations are only performed when the system is properly initialized
    and enabled. It's a read-only check and does not modify any internal state.
