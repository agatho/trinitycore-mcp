  class: PerformanceProfile
  method: PerformanceProfile
  signature: void PerformanceProfile::PerformanceProfile(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a performance profile for the specified GUID.
  description: The PerformanceProfile constructor initializes a performance profiling
    object associated with a specific GUID, typically representing a player or entity
    in the game world. This method sets up internal tracking mechanisms to monitor
    and record performance metrics such as update times, resource usage, and execution
    durations for the given entity. The initialization process may involve allocating
    memory, setting default values, and preparing data structures necessary for profiling
    operations. This is commonly used in TrinityCore's performance monitoring systems
    to gather detailed statistics about gameplay behavior and system efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity to profile. This typically
      represents a player, creature, or game object within the TrinityCore world.
      Must be a valid non-zero GUID value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Performance Profile for Player
    code: 'PerformanceProfile profile(12345);

      // Initializes a performance profile for player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Performance Profile Initialization
    code: 'uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      PerformanceProfile* prof = new PerformanceProfile(playerGuid);

      // Dynamically initialize performance profile for a player object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs memory allocation and initialization of
    internal profiling data structures. It should be called during entity creation
    or activation to ensure proper performance tracking. The GUID parameter is critical
    for identifying which entity's performance metrics are being collected.
  warnings: Calling this constructor with a zero or invalid GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or profiling errors. Ensure the GUID corresponds to an actual existing
    entity in the game world before initialization.
