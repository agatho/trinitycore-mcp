  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetQuality() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quality level of the item template.
  description: The GetQuality method returns the quality value associated with this
    item template. In World of Warcraft, item quality determines visual appearance,
    stat bonuses, and categorization of items. The returned value typically corresponds
    to predefined quality levels such as Poor (0), Common (1), Uncommon (2), Rare
    (3), Epic (4), Legendary (5), Artifact (6), and Heirloom (7). This method is commonly
    used in item processing, display logic, and game mechanics that depend on item
    rarity. The value is read from the database field 'Quality' which is stored as
    a uint32 integer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the item's quality level. Valid values typically
    range from 0 to 7, where 0 = Poor, 1 = Common, 2 = Uncommon, 3 = Rare, 4 = Epic,
    5 = Legendary, 6 = Artifact, and 7 = Heirloom.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32\
      \ quality = itemTemplate->GetQuality();\nif (quality >= ITEM_QUALITY_RARE)\n\
      {\n    // Handle rare or better items\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Quality-Based Item Processing
    code: "void ProcessItem(ItemTemplate* itemTemplate)\n{\n    uint32 quality = itemTemplate->GetQuality();\n\
      \    switch (quality)\n    {\n        case ITEM_QUALITY_POOR:\n            //\
      \ Handle poor quality items\n            break;\n        case ITEM_QUALITY_COMMON:\n\
      \            // Handle common quality items\n            break;\n        case\
      \ ITEM_QUALITY_UNCOMMON:\n            // Handle uncommon quality items\n   \
      \         break;\n        case ITEM_QUALITY_RARE:\n            // Handle rare\
      \ quality items\n            break;\n        case ITEM_QUALITY_EPIC:\n     \
      \       // Handle epic quality items\n            break;\n        case ITEM_QUALITY_LEGENDARY:\n\
      \            // Handle legendary quality items\n            break;\n       \
      \ case ITEM_QUALITY_ARTIFACT:\n            // Handle artifact quality items\n\
      \            break;\n        case ITEM_QUALITY_HEIRLOOM:\n            // Handle\
      \ heirloom quality items\n            break;\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method directly accesses the cached item template data. It is safe to
    call from any thread context as long as the ItemTemplate object itself is properly
    synchronized or thread-safe. The returned value is immutable once loaded and should
    not change during runtime.
  warnings: Ensure that the ItemTemplate pointer is valid before calling this method
    to avoid segmentation faults. This method does not perform any validation on the
    quality value beyond returning what is stored in the database, so unexpected values
    may occur if data corruption happens.
