  class: MapManager
  method: SetMapUpdateInterval
  signature: void MapManager::SetMapUpdateInterval(uint32 t)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for map-related operations in milliseconds.
  description: The SetMapUpdateInterval method configures how frequently map updates
    occur within the TrinityCore server. This interval controls the frequency at which
    various map systems process player movements, object updates, and other dynamic
    elements. The parameter t specifies the update interval in milliseconds, with
    lower values resulting in more frequent but potentially more resource-intensive
    updates. This setting affects overall server performance and responsiveness, particularly
    in high-traffic areas or when handling large numbers of players simultaneously.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. Valid values are typically positive
      integers representing time intervals. Lower values increase update frequency
      but may impact server performance. Typical values range from 50 to 500 milliseconds
      depending on server configuration and load requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Standard Update Interval
    code: MapManager::instance()->SetMapUpdateInterval(100);
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimizing for High Performance
    code: MapManager::instance()->SetMapUpdateInterval(250);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global setting that affects all maps in the server.
    Changes take effect immediately and impact all ongoing map operations. The optimal
    interval value depends on server hardware capabilities, player density, and desired
    responsiveness levels.
  warnings: Setting the update interval too low may cause excessive CPU usage and
    performance degradation. Setting it too high can result in noticeable lag in player
    movement and object updates. This setting should be carefully tuned based on server
    load testing.
