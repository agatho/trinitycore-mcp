  brief: Loads and initializes Dragonflight dungeon data for the DungeonBehavior system
  description: This method is responsible for loading all Dragonflight era dungeon
    configurations and associated data into the DungeonBehavior system. It typically
    reads dungeon templates, difficulty settings, loot tables, and encounter mechanics
    from database or configuration files. The method ensures that all Dragonflight
    dungeons are properly registered and available for player encounters within the
    game world. This initialization process occurs during server startup or when the
    dungeon behavior system is initialized, making sure that players can access and
    engage with Dragonflight content seamlessly.

  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization and should not
    be invoked repeatedly. It may perform database queries or file I/O operations,
    so calling it in performance-critical sections could impact server responsiveness.
