  class: ObjectMgr
  method: ~ObjectMgr
  signature: void ObjectMgr::~ObjectMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ObjectMgr instance and cleans up all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the ObjectMgr class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources that were allocated during the object's lifetime. In
    TrinityCore, ObjectMgr manages a wide variety of game objects including creatures,
    game objects, items, players, and other entities. When this destructor is called,
    it ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures such as caches, maps, and
    lookup tables that store references to these game objects. This method typically
    gets invoked automatically when the ObjectMgr instance goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted, ensuring no memory leaks occur in the game server's object
    management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ObjectMgr instance
    code: "void Cleanup() {\n    // ObjectMgr is typically a singleton, but if manually\
      \ instantiated\n    ObjectMgr* mgr = new ObjectMgr();\n    // ... use the manager\
      \ ...\n    delete mgr; // This calls ~ObjectMgr()\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs critical cleanup operations including freeing memory
    allocated for cached data, closing database connections if applicable, and ensuring
    that no dangling pointers remain in internal lookup tables. It is important to
    note that this destructor should not be called manually unless you have explicitly
    created an ObjectMgr instance; typically it's managed by the TrinityCore server
    framework.
  warnings: Do not manually call this destructor on singleton instances of ObjectMgr
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The destructor assumes all internal
    resources are properly initialized and should only be invoked when the ObjectMgr
    object is no longer needed.
