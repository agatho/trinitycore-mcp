  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: GetResourcePool
  signature: BotResourcePool * BotSpawnOrchestrator::GetResourcePool() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the resource pool associated with the bot spawn orchestrator for
    managing shared resources.
  description: The GetResourcePool method returns a pointer to the BotResourcePool
    object that is managed by the BotSpawnOrchestrator. This resource pool typically
    contains shared data such as available bot templates, configuration settings,
    and other resources needed for spawning and managing bots within the game world.
    The returned pointer is const-qualified, indicating that the caller should not
    modify the resource pool through this interface. The method ensures thread-safe
    access to the resource pool instance, which is critical in multi-threaded environments
    where multiple systems may be requesting bot resources simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotResourcePool object associated with this orchestrator.
    Returns nullptr if no resource pool has been initialized or if the orchestrator
    is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotResourcePool* pool = orchestrator->GetResourcePool();\nif (pool != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the resource pool\n    pool->Update();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Bot Templates
    code: "BotSpawnOrchestrator* orchestrator = sBotSpawnOrchestrator;\nBotResourcePool*\
      \ pool = orchestrator->GetResourcePool();\nif (pool)\n{\n    auto templates\
      \ = pool->GetAvailableTemplates();\n    for (const auto& template : templates)\n\
      \    {\n        // Process each bot template\n        sLog->outString(\"Template:\
      \ %s\", template.GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned BotResourcePool pointer is managed by the BotSpawnOrchestrator
    and should not be deleted or modified directly. The method performs no locking
    internally, so callers should ensure proper synchronization if accessing from
    multiple threads. This method may return nullptr if the orchestrator has not been
    fully initialized or if resource pool creation failed.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value guarantees valid data within
    the BotResourcePool. Always validate the pool's internal state before using its
    methods. Avoid storing the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the orchestrator,
    as it may become invalid during shutdown or reinitialization.
