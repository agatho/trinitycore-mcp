documentation:
  brief: Returns the money multiplier value for the quest
  description: The GetMoneyMultiplier method retrieves the monetary reward multiplier
    associated with a specific quest. This value determines how much gold a player
    will receive when completing the quest, relative to the base quest reward. The
    multiplier is typically used in conjunction with other quest parameters to calculate
    final rewards. It represents a scaling factor that can be greater than or less
    than 1.0, affecting the amount of gold received by players based on quest level
    and difficulty.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the money multiplier for the quest.
    This value is typically between 0.0 and 3.0, where values greater than 1.0 indicate
    increased reward amounts, and values less than 1.0 indicate reduced reward amounts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float multiplier = quest->GetMoneyMultiplier();

      // Use multiplier to calculate final gold reward

      float baseGold = 100.0f;

      float finalGold = baseGold * multiplier;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class in TrinityCore and is used primarily
    for calculating quest rewards. The value returned by this method is typically
    set during quest creation or can be modified through game mechanics. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this is a simple getter method.
  warnings: This method should not be called on quests that have not been properly
    initialized or loaded. Calling it on invalid quest objects may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes.
