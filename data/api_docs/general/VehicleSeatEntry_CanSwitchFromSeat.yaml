documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can switch from their current vehicle seat.
  description: The CanSwitchFromSeat method evaluates whether the player currently
    occupying a vehicle seat is permitted to switch to another seat. This check typically
    considers factors such as seat flags, vehicle status, and player permissions.
    The method is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to enforce vehicle
    seat switching rules during gameplay. It returns true if the player can switch
    seats, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper
    vehicle behavior and preventing invalid seat transitions in World of Warcraft-style
    gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can switch from their current vehicle seat,
    false if switching is not allowed. The decision is based on vehicle seat configuration
    flags and game rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Seat Switch Check
    code: "VehicleSeatEntry* seat = vehicle->GetSeatForPassenger(player);\nif (seat\
      \ && seat->CanSwitchFromSeat()) {\n    // Allow player to switch seats\n   \
      \ player->SendMoveVehicleUnboard(0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during vehicle interaction events and relies
    on the internal state of the vehicle seat entry. It does not perform any external
    validation beyond the seat's configuration flags.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for complex seat switching logic; additional
    checks for player state, vehicle status, and permissions may be required in certain
    scenarios.
