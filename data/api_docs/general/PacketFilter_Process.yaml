  class: PacketFilter
  method: Process
  signature: bool PacketFilter::Process(WorldPacket * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a WorldPacket through the packet filter to determine if it should
    be allowed or blocked.
  description: The Process method in the PacketFilter class evaluates incoming WorldPackets
    to decide whether they should be passed through to the client or blocked based
    on configured filtering rules. This method is typically used for implementing
    anti-cheat measures, packet validation, or custom packet handling logic. It operates
    on a single WorldPacket parameter and returns true if the packet should be allowed,
    or false if it should be dropped. The method may modify the packet contents during
    processing, though this behavior depends on the specific implementation of the
    filter.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the WorldPacket object that needs to be processed by the
      filter. This packet contains the raw network data being evaluated for filtering.
  returns: Returns true if the packet should be allowed through the filter and sent
    to the client, or false if the packet should be blocked and not delivered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic packet filtering
    code: "bool result = packetFilter->Process(&incomingPacket);\nif (!result) {\n\
      \    // Packet was blocked by filter\n    return;\n}\n// Continue processing\
      \ allowed packet\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional packet filtering with logging
    code: "bool PacketFilter::Process(WorldPacket* packet) {\n    if (packet->GetOpcode()\
      \ == SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT) {\n        // Log or inspect specific packet types\n\
      \        sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_PACKETS, \"Processing update object packet\"\
      );\n    }\n    return true; // Allow all packets through in this example\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the network processing pipeline in
    TrinityCore. It's important to note that modifying packet contents directly within
    Process() can affect gameplay behavior, so caution should be exercised when implementing
    custom filtering logic.
  warnings: Modifying or dropping packets in this method can have unintended consequences
    on gameplay and player experience. Ensure proper testing of any custom packet
    filtering logic. The method may be called from different threads depending on
    the server configuration.
