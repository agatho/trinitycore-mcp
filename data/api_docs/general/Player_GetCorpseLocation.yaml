documentation:
  brief: Returns the location coordinates of the player's corpse after death.
  description: The GetCorpseLocation method retrieves the current position coordinates
    of a player's corpse in the game world. This method is typically used when a player
    dies and their corpse remains in the world, allowing other players or NPCs to
    locate and interact with the corpse. The returned coordinates represent the X,
    Y, Z position values where the corpse is located, which can be used for various
    game mechanics such as corpse retrieval, resurrection spell targeting, or quest
    completion. The method returns a const reference to an integer array containing
    three values representing the coordinate components.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to an integer array containing three values representing
    the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the player's corpse location. The first element
    corresponds to the X coordinate, the second to the Y coordinate, and the third
    to the Z coordinate. These values are typically in world coordinates and may be
    used for locating the corpse or performing related actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int const& corpseLocation = player->GetCorpseLocation();

      int x = corpseLocation[0];

      int y = corpseLocation[1];

      int z = corpseLocation[2];'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other corpse-related functions
    like GetCorpse() or GetCorpseType(). The returned coordinates are usually valid
    only while the player's corpse exists in the world. This method is thread-safe
    as it does not modify any internal state, but should be used carefully when dealing
    with multiple players' corpses simultaneously.
  warnings: This method may return null values if the player has no corpse or if the
    player is not in a valid state for corpse retrieval. Care should be taken when
    using these coordinates for positioning purposes as they might not always reflect
    the actual location of the corpse due to game mechanics and server-side processing.
