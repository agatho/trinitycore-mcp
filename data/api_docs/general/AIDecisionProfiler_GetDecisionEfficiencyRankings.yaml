documentation:
  brief: Returns a sorted list of AI decision IDs and their efficiency ratings.
  description: The GetDecisionEfficiencyRankings method retrieves a vector of pairs
    containing AI decision identifiers and their corresponding efficiency scores.
    Each pair consists of a uint32_t representing the decision ID and a double indicating
    its efficiency rating, which is typically calculated based on how effectively
    that decision contributes to the AI's overall performance or goal achievement.
    The results are sorted in descending order of efficiency, with the most effective
    decisions appearing first. This method is primarily used for profiling and optimizing
    AI behavior within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector of std::pair<uint32_t, double> where each pair represents
    an AI decision ID and its efficiency rating. The vector is sorted in descending
    order by efficiency score. Each element's first value (uint32_t) corresponds to
    a unique AI decision identifier, and the second value (double) indicates how efficiently
    that decision contributes to AI performance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "AIDecisionProfiler profiler;\n// ... populate profiler with data ...\n\
      auto rankings = profiler.GetDecisionEfficiencyRankings();\nfor (const auto&\
      \ pair : rankings) {\n    std::cout << \"Decision ID: \" << pair.first \n  \
      \            << \", Efficiency: \" << pair.second << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that efficiency metrics have already been calculated
    and stored within the profiler instance. The returned vector is a copy of internal
    data, so modifications to it won't affect the original profiler state. Performance-wise,
    this operation should be relatively fast as it only returns pre-computed values.
