documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SceneObject instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The SceneObject destructor is automatically invoked when a SceneObject
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of all internal resources, including memory deallocation, removal from
    scene management systems, and invalidation of any references to the object. In
    the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, SceneObjects represent
    dynamic visual elements such as quest markers, environmental effects, or temporary
    objects that are managed by the scene system. The destructor performs necessary
    cleanup to prevent memory leaks and maintain the integrity of the scene graph.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SceneObject
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    SceneObject* sceneObj = new SceneObject();\n\
      \    // ... use sceneObj ...\n    delete sceneObj; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-allocated SceneObject destruction
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    SceneObject sceneObj;\n    // ... use sceneObj\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when sceneObj goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically not called directly by user code. It's automatically
    invoked during object lifetime management. SceneObject instances should be properly
    managed through smart pointers or standard RAII principles to ensure safe destruction.
