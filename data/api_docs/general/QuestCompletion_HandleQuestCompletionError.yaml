  class: QuestCompletion
  method: HandleQuestCompletionError
  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleQuestCompletionError(Player * bot, uint32
    questId, const std::string & error)
documentation:
  brief: Handles quest completion errors for a player by logging the error and notifying
    the player.
  description: The HandleQuestCompletionError method is responsible for managing and
    reporting errors that occur during the quest completion process in TrinityCore.
    It takes a player reference, a quest identifier, and an error message string to
    log the issue and potentially notify the player through in-game communication.
    This method ensures that quest-related failures are properly documented and can
    be used for debugging or player feedback purposes. The method does not return
    any value, as its primary purpose is to handle the error state rather than resolve
    it.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who encountered
      the quest completion error.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier (uint32) of the quest that failed during completion.
  - name: error
    description: String containing a descriptive message about the error that occurred
      during quest completion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Handling Example
    code: "void SomeQuestHandler(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    if (!player\
      \ || questId == 0) {\n        QuestCompletion::HandleQuestCompletionError(player,\
      \ questId, \"Invalid player or quest ID\");\n        return;\n    }\n    //\
      \ Additional logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the context of AI bots or automated
    quest handling systems in TrinityCore. It assumes that the Player object passed
    is valid and that the questId corresponds to an existing quest in the database.
    The error message should be concise yet informative for debugging purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null reference may lead to undefined behavior. Also, avoid using
    this method for handling successful quest completions; it's specifically designed
    for error cases.
