  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool AIDecisionProfiler::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AI decision profiler to begin tracking and logging AI decision-making
    processes.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the AIDecisionProfiler class for monitoring
    AI behavior within the TrinityCore framework. It prepares internal data structures,
    configures logging mechanisms, and ensures that subsequent AI decisions can be
    accurately tracked and measured. This method must be called before any profiling
    activities can occur. The initialization process typically involves setting up
    performance counters, allocating memory buffers, and establishing connections
    to the game's logging subsystem. If initialization fails, the profiler will not
    function correctly and subsequent calls to profile methods may result in undefined
    behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the profiler was successfully initialized and is ready
    for use; returns false if initialization failed due to resource constraints, configuration
    errors, or other initialization issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "AIDecisionProfiler profiler;\nbool success = profiler.Initialize();\nif\
      \ (success)\n{\n    // Profiler is ready for use\n    // Begin AI decision profiling\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle.
    Multiple calls to Initialize may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks.
    The profiler requires proper configuration files and logging permissions to function
    correctly.
  warnings: Calling Initialize after the profiler has already been initialized may
    lead to memory corruption or inconsistent profiling data. Ensure that all necessary
    configuration settings are properly set before calling this method.
