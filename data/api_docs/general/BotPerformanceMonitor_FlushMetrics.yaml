documentation:
  brief: Flushes accumulated performance metrics to persistent storage or logging
    system
  description: The FlushMetrics method in BotPerformanceMonitor is responsible for
    writing all collected performance data to a designated output destination, such
    as log files or database tables. This method typically aggregates timing measurements,
    resource usage statistics, and other diagnostic information gathered during bot
    operation. It ensures that performance data is not lost due to system crashes
    or shutdowns by persisting the metrics to durable storage. The flush operation
    may be triggered manually or automatically at regular intervals based on configuration
    settings.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.FlushMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Performance Logging
    code: "void UpdateBotPerformance()\n{\n    // ... collect performance data ...\n\
      \    BotPerformanceMonitor::Instance()->FlushMetrics();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during shutdown sequences or at regular intervals
    to ensure data persistence. It may block execution until all metrics are written
    to storage, so it should be used judiciously in performance-critical code paths.
