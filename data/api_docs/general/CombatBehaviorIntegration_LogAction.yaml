api:
  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: LogAction
  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::LogAction(const RecommendedAction & action,
    bool executed)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a recommended combat action with execution status for behavior tracking
    and analysis.
  description: The LogAction method records a recommended combat action along with
    whether it was executed, enabling detailed tracking of AI decision-making processes
    during combat. This functionality is crucial for debugging, performance optimization,
    and understanding how the AI behaves in various combat scenarios. The method likely
    stores this information in a log system or database for later analysis by developers
    or automated tools. It may also be used to generate combat reports or feed data
    into machine learning models that improve AI behavior over time.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: The RecommendedAction object containing details about the combat
      action being logged, including type, target, and priority.
  - name: executed
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the recommended action was actually
      executed (true) or not (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Logging
    code: 'CombatBehaviorIntegration combatAI;

      RecommendedAction action;

      action.type = ACTION_MELEE_ATTACK;

      action.target = playerGuid;

      action.priority = 100;

      combatAI.LogAction(action, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Non-Executed Action
    code: 'CombatBehaviorIntegration combatAI;

      RecommendedAction action;

      action.type = ACTION_CAST_SPELL;

      action.target = npcGuid;

      action.priority = 80;

      combatAI.LogAction(action, false); // Action was recommended but not executed
      due to cooldown'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger combat AI system that tracks decision-making
    patterns. The logging mechanism may be configurable for different verbosity levels
    or output destinations (console, file, database). It's important to consider performance
    implications when logging frequently during active combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure proper synchronization if this method is called from multiple threads
    during combat processing. Improper handling of the action data could lead to incorrect
    behavior tracking or memory corruption.
