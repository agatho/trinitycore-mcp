documentation:
  brief: Updates the resource manager's internal state based on the elapsed game time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and managing resource-related
    operations within the ResourceManager class. It typically handles tasks such as
    updating resource counts, checking for resource depletion, triggering resource
    regeneration, or performing any time-based calculations necessary for maintaining
    accurate resource states in the game world. This method is commonly called during
    the game loop's update cycle to ensure that resources are properly synchronized
    with the passage of time.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\n\
      \    resourceManager.Update(diff);\n    // ... other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop's update phase.
    The 'diff' parameter represents the time elapsed since the last update in milliseconds,
    which is crucial for accurate time-based resource calculations.
