documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique thread identifier for the current execution context.
  description: The GetThreadId method retrieves the unique identifier of the thread
    that is currently executing within this ExecutionContext instance. This identifier
    is a std::thread::id object which uniquely identifies the thread in the system.
    In the context of TrinityCore, this method is typically used for debugging, logging,
    or tracking thread-specific operations within the server's multi-threaded environment.
    The returned identifier remains consistent throughout the lifetime of the thread
    and can be used to distinguish between different execution contexts when multiple
    threads are involved.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::thread::id object representing the unique identifier of the current
    thread executing within this ExecutionContext. This identifier is guaranteed to
    be unique among all active threads in the program and remains constant for the
    duration of the thread's existence.

  - title: Basic Usage to Log Current Thread ID
    code: "void MyFunction() {\n    ExecutionContext context;\n    std::thread::id\
      \ currentId = context.GetThreadId();\n    std::cout << \"Current thread ID:\
      \ \" << currentId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Thread IDs for Debugging
    code: "class MyHandler {\npublic:\n    void ProcessData() {\n        ExecutionContext\
      \ context;\n        std::thread::id threadId = context.GetThreadId();\n    \
      \    // Compare with another thread's ID\n        if (threadId == std::this_thread::get_id())\
      \ {\n            // This is the main thread\n            Log(\"Running on main\
      \ thread\");\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned std::thread::id can be used with std::hash to create hash tables
    or maps keyed by thread identifiers. In TrinityCore, this method is particularly
    useful for multi-threaded systems where you need to track which thread is handling
    specific tasks. The identifier is generated by the underlying C++ standard library
    implementation and is not related to OS-level thread IDs.
  warnings: Be aware that comparing thread::id objects directly using == is valid,
    but the actual values are implementation-defined. Do not assume that lower numeric
    values indicate earlier creation of threads. Also, thread identifiers may be reused
    after a thread has terminated, though this is typically not an issue in TrinityCore's
    context where threads usually run for extended periods.
