  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::StartPerformanceCapture()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates performance data collection for the enhanced bot AI system
  description: Starts capturing performance metrics and timing data for the EnhancedBotAI
    instance. This method enables monitoring of AI decision-making processes, reaction
    times, and overall system efficiency. The captured data can be used for optimization,
    debugging, or analyzing bot behavior patterns during gameplay. Performance capture
    typically begins recording from the moment this method is called until StopPerformanceCapture
    is invoked.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Capture Start
    code: 'EnhancedBotAI* botAI = new EnhancedBotAI();

      botAI->StartPerformanceCapture();

      // AI performance metrics are now being recorded'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot AI is in an active state.
    Performance capture may introduce minor overhead to the AI processing cycle. The
    captured data is typically stored internally and can be retrieved via dedicated
    getter methods after stopping the capture.
  warnings: Calling StartPerformanceCapture multiple times without stopping previous
    captures may lead to undefined behavior or corrupted performance data. Ensure
    that StopPerformanceCapture is always called after starting capture to avoid resource
    leaks.
