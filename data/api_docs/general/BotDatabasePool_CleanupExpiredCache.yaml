documentation:
  brief: Removes expired cache entries from the bot database pool to free up resources
    and maintain performance.
  description: The CleanupExpiredCache method is responsible for removing outdated
    or expired entries from the internal cache of the BotDatabasePool. This ensures
    that stale data does not persist in memory, which could otherwise lead to resource
    leaks or inconsistent behavior. The method typically operates by iterating through
    cached database connections or query results and identifying those that have exceeded
    their configured lifetime. It's an essential maintenance function for keeping
    the bot database pool efficient and responsive. This operation is usually performed
    periodically as part of routine system housekeeping.

  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the system's background
    maintenance routines. Developers should not need to call it directly unless implementing
    custom cache management logic. The cleanup process may involve locking mechanisms
    to ensure thread safety during cache modifications.
