  method: ApplyCelestialBonus
  signature: void AstralPowerResource::ApplyCelestialBonus(float multiplier)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a celestial bonus multiplier to the astral power resource.
  description: The ApplyCelestialBonus method modifies the current astral power resource
    by applying a specified multiplier. This method is typically used in game mechanics
    where celestial effects or buffs influence the rate at which astral power accumulates
    or is consumed. The multiplier parameter determines how much the astral power
    value is scaled, with values greater than 1 increasing the resource and values
    less than 1 decreasing it. This function does not directly alter the base resource
    amount but rather applies a scaling factor to an existing value.
  parameters:
  - name: multiplier
    description: A floating-point value that serves as the scaling factor for the
      astral power resource. Values greater than 1 increase the resource, while values
      less than 1 decrease it. A value of 1 leaves the resource unchanged.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply a 1.5x celestial bonus to astral power
    code: 'AstralPowerResource resource;

      resource.ApplyCelestialBonus(1.5f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reduce astral power by 20% using celestial bonus
    code: 'AstralPowerResource resource;

      resource.ApplyCelestialBonus(0.8f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal game state tracking for astral
    power resources, and should be called after the resource has been initialized
    or modified. The multiplier is applied directly to the current value of the resource
    without any clamping or bounds checking.
  warnings: Ensure that the multiplier parameter is a valid positive floating-point
    number. Negative multipliers may produce unexpected behavior, and zero multipliers
    will effectively nullify the resource. This method should not be called in performance-critical
    sections without prior testing.
