    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Handles client requests for rated PvP information, including season statistics
    and leaderboard data.
  description: This method processes incoming requests from players for detailed rated
    PvP information. It retrieves and sends back structured data about the player's
    current season ranking, match history, and competitive statistics. The method
    is typically invoked when a player opens the Rated PvP section in their character
    interface or when they request specific leaderboard details. The implementation
    ensures that only authenticated players with valid session states can access this
    information, and it respects server-side configuration settings for rated PvP
    availability. This functionality supports the World of Warcraft's competitive
    battleground system by providing real-time data synchronization between client
    and server.

  - title: Basic Usage in Session Handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestRatedPvpInfo(WorldPackets::Battleground::RequestRatedPvpInfo&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Validate session state\n    if (!GetPlayer() || !GetPlayer()->IsInWorld())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Process and send rated PvP info\n    SendRatedPvpInfo();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal server data structures that maintain ranked
    PvP statistics. It should only be called during active gameplay sessions where
    the player has proper authentication. The method does not perform any direct database
    queries but rather accesses cached or precomputed data structures for performance
    reasons.
  warnings: Improper handling of session validation can lead to unauthorized access
    to competitive data. Ensure that all calls to this method are properly authenticated
    before processing. Avoid calling this method outside of valid gameplay contexts
    as it may cause synchronization issues with the client UI.
