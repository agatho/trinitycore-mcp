  class: Unit
  method: GetAdvFlyingSpeedMin
  signature: float Unit::GetAdvFlyingSpeedMin(AdvFlyingRateTypeRange speedType) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum advanced flying speed for the specified speed type.
  description: This method retrieves the minimum flying speed value for a given AdvFlyingRateTypeRange,
    which is used in World of Warcraft's advanced flying mechanics. It provides the
    base speed that players can fly at when using advanced flying capabilities. The
    method is typically used in conjunction with other flying-related functions to
    determine overall flying speed behavior and to calculate movement rates during
    flight. This function is essential for understanding player movement mechanics
    in the game's flying system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the minimum flying speed for the specified
    speed type. The value typically represents the base speed in yards per second,
    with values usually ranging from 0.0 to 100.0 depending on the specific speed
    type and game context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float minSpeed = unit->GetAdvFlyingSpeedMin(ADV_FLYING_SPEED_TYPE_NORMAL);

      std::cout << "Minimum flying speed: " << minSpeed << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the advanced flying system and should be used in conjunction
    with other flying-related methods for complete movement calculations. It may return
    different values based on player's current flight state and game mechanics.
  warnings: This method might not be available in all game versions or contexts, as
    it depends on the specific implementation of the flying system. Care should be
    taken when using this method in conjunction with other speed-related functions
    to avoid incorrect movement calculations.
