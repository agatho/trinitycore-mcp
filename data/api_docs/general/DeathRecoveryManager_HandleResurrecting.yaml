  brief: Processes and handles the resurrection of players who are in the process
    of being resurrected.
  description: The HandleResurrecting method is responsible for managing the resurrection
    state of players within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically called
    during the game loop to update the status of players who have been marked for
    resurrection, such as those who died and are waiting for a resurrection spell
    or are being revived by a priest or other player. It processes the necessary game
    logic to transition players from a dead state back to life, including updating
    their health, mana, and any relevant flags or states. The method takes a time
    delta parameter to determine how much time has passed since the last update, which
    is essential for managing timed resurrection effects or animations.
  parameters: []

  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    deathRecoveryManager.HandleResurrecting(diff);\n\
      \    // ... rest of game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core game loop or a dedicated update
    thread. It's important to ensure that this method is called regularly to maintain
    proper resurrection state handling and prevent players from remaining in an invalid
    dead state indefinitely.
