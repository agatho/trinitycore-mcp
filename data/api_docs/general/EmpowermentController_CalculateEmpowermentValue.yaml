  class: EmpowermentController
  method: CalculateEmpowermentValue
  signature: float EmpowermentController::CalculateEmpowermentValue(EmpowermentLevel
    level)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the empowerment value based on the specified empowerment
    level.
  description: The CalculateEmpowermentValue method computes a float-based empowerment
    value derived from the provided EmpowermentLevel enum. This method is typically
    used within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine
    the effectiveness or magnitude of an empowerment effect, such as for buffs, abilities,
    or spell enhancements. The calculation may involve internal scaling factors, level
    multipliers, or other game-specific mechanics that influence how empowerment scales
    with different levels. The method assumes a valid EmpowermentLevel input and does
    not perform explicit validation, so callers should ensure the input is within
    expected bounds.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The EmpowermentLevel enum value that determines the base calculation
      for empowerment. Valid values are typically defined within the EmpowermentLevel
      enumeration and represent different tiers or stages of empowerment.
  returns: A float representing the calculated empowerment value. The exact numeric
    value depends on internal logic, which may scale based on level, game state, or
    other factors. Returns zero or a negative value if an invalid level is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float empowerment = controller.CalculateEmpowermentValue(EmpowermentLevel::LEVEL_1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Conditional Logic
    code: "EmpowermentLevel level = GetPlayerEmpowermentLevel();\nif (level != EmpowermentLevel::INVALID)\n\
      {\n    float value = controller.CalculateEmpowermentValue(level);\n    ApplyEmpowermentEffect(value);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger empowerment system and may interact
    with other game mechanics such as player stats, spell modifiers, or buff durations.
    It's recommended to cache results if the same level is queried multiple times
    in a single frame to avoid redundant calculations.
  warnings: Passing an invalid EmpowermentLevel enum value may lead to unexpected
    behavior or incorrect empowerment values. Ensure that all inputs are validated
    before calling this method.
