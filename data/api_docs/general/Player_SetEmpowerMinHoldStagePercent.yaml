documentation:
  brief: Sets the minimum hold stage percentage for empower ability.
  description: This method configures the minimum percentage of time that must pass
    before a player can use their empower ability. It controls the cooldown behavior
    of the empower ability, ensuring that players cannot use it immediately after
    casting. The method affects the gameplay mechanics related to mana management
    and ability usage timing in World of Warcraft.

  examples:
  - title: Setting Empower Minimum Hold Stage Percent
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetEmpowerMinHoldStagePercent(25.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method likely modifies internal
    cooldown tracking for the empower ability, affecting how frequently players can
    use it during combat. Performance considerations include potential impact on mana
    regeneration and overall gameplay balance.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may affect gameplay balance
    if set incorrectly. Setting too high a value could prevent players from using
    their empower ability effectively, while setting too low might cause unintended
    cooldown behavior.
