documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all game object addons from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadGameObjectAddons method retrieves all records from the GameObjectAddon
    table in the database and populates internal data structures with the addon information
    for game objects. This method is typically called during server startup or database
    reload operations to ensure that all game object addons, such as spawn positions,
    orientation, and other metadata, are properly loaded into memory for use by the
    game world. It iterates through the database entries and constructs GameObjectAddon
    objects that store additional data about how game objects should be positioned
    or behave in the world.

    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadGameObjectAddons();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup or when reloading game
    object data from the database. It's important to note that this method modifies
    internal state and should not be called concurrently with other methods that access
    the same data structures without proper synchronization.
