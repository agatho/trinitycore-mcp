  signature: bool CreatureStaticFlagsHolder::HasFlag(CreatureStaticFlags8 flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified static flag is set within the creature's static flags
    holder.
  description: The HasFlag method determines whether a particular CreatureStaticFlags8
    flag is currently set in the CreatureStaticFlagsHolder instance. This functionality
    is essential for determining creature behavior, AI states, and other game mechanics
    that rely on static configuration flags. The method performs a bitwise check against
    the internal flag storage to return true if the specified flag is present, or
    false otherwise. It is commonly used in conditional logic within the TrinityCore
    server to control how creatures interact with the world and respond to various
    events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified CreatureStaticFlags8 flag is set in the holder;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flag Check
    code: "if (creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->GetStaticFlags().HasFlag(CREATURE_STATIC_FLAG_NO_PVP))\
      \ {\n    // Creature cannot engage in PvP combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AI Behavior
    code: "if (creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->GetStaticFlags().HasFlag(CREATURE_STATIC_FLAG_SPAWN_INACTIVE))\
      \ {\n    creature->SetVisible(false);\n    creature->SetPhaseMask(0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple bitwise operation and has O(1) time complexity.
    It is safe for concurrent access as long as the underlying flag storage is not
    being modified during the check. The method assumes that the CreatureStaticFlags8
    enum values are properly defined with distinct bit positions to avoid false positives.
  warnings: Ensure that the flag value passed to HasFlag corresponds to a valid and
    defined CreatureStaticFlags8 enum member. Using an undefined or invalid flag value
    may lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results in conditional logic.
