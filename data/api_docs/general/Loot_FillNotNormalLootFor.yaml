documentation:
  brief: Fills the loot list for a player with non-normal loot types such as quest
    items or disenchanting results.
  description: The FillNotNormalLootFor method populates a player's loot window with
    items that are not part of normal loot drops, including quest rewards, disenchanting
    results, and other special loot types. This method is typically invoked when a
    player interacts with an object that may contain non-standard loot, such as a
    quest item drop or a disenchantable item. It ensures that the player's loot window
    displays all applicable non-normal items without affecting regular loot mechanics.
    The method operates on the player's current loot context and updates their local
    loot list accordingly.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Interaction
    code: "void HandlePlayerInteraction(Player* player, WorldObject* target)\n{\n\
      \    if (target->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_GAMEOBJECT)\n    {\n        GameObject*\
      \ go = reinterpret_cast<GameObject*>(target);\n        if (go->GetGOInfo()->type\
      \ == GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_QUESTGIVER)\n        {\n            // Fill quest-related\
      \ loot\n            player->GetLoot()->FillNotNormalLootFor(player);\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot system's internal logic and should not be
    called directly by most game scripts. It relies on the player's current loot context
    being properly initialized before execution.
