  method: ClearChangesMask
  signature: void CraftingOrder::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the crafting order, resetting its modified state
    flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a CraftingOrder
    object, effectively clearing any pending modifications or dirty flags that indicate
    the order has been altered since last synchronization. This is typically used
    after saving changes to persistent storage or when synchronizing the crafting
    order state with the client. The method ensures that subsequent checks for changes
    will not detect previously modified fields unless new modifications occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Saving
    code: 'CraftingOrder* order = GetCraftingOrder();

      // ... perform modifications ...

      order->SaveToDatabase();

      order->ClearChangesMask(); // Reset after saving'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any successful synchronization or persistence
    operation to prevent redundant updates. It does not modify the actual crafting
    order data, only its change tracking state.
