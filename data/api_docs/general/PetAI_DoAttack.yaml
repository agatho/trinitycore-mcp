  class: PetAI
  method: DoAttack
  signature: void PetAI::DoAttack(int * target, bool chase)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior on a specified target for the pet AI.
  description: The DoAttack method is responsible for triggering the pet's attack
    behavior against a given target. It handles the logic for selecting and engaging
    an enemy, including managing the pet's movement and attack timing. The method
    supports both chasing and non-chasing attack modes, allowing pets to either pursue
    targets or maintain their current position while attacking. This functionality
    is integral to the pet AI system in TrinityCore, ensuring that summoned creatures
    behave appropriately in combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier. This
      value typically corresponds to a unit's GUID or similar unique identifier used
      by the game engine to track entities.
  - name: chase
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the pet should chase its target.
      When true, the pet will move towards the target; when false, it will attack
      from its current position without movement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Usage
    code: 'PetAI* petAI = player->GetPet()->AI();

      int targetId = 12345;

      petAI->DoAttack(&targetId, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Non-Chasing Attack
    code: 'PetAI* petAI = player->GetPet()->AI();

      int targetId = 67890;

      petAI->DoAttack(&targetId, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the pet has a valid target and that the target is
    within attack range. The actual combat behavior may be influenced by other factors
    such as pet state, cooldowns, and spell availability. Developers should ensure
    that the target parameter points to a valid unit before calling this method.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes if the target does not exist or is invalid. Always verify that the
    target exists and is accessible before invoking DoAttack.
