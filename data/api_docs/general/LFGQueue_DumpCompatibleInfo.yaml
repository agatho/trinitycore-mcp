  class: LFGQueue
  method: DumpCompatibleInfo
  signature: std::string LFGQueue::DumpCompatibleInfo(bool full) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a formatted string containing compatibility information for LFG
    queue entries.
  description: The DumpCompatibleInfo method retrieves and formats detailed compatibility
    data for all entries currently in the LFG (Looking For Group) queue. This includes
    information about player roles, class restrictions, level requirements, and other
    matching criteria that determine whether players are compatible for group formation.
    The output string is designed for debugging or logging purposes to help developers
    understand why certain players may or may not be matched together in groups. When
    the 'full' parameter is set to true, additional verbose details about each queue
    entry are included.
  parameters:
  - name: full
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to include detailed or summary information.
      If true, includes comprehensive compatibility data for each queued player; if
      false, returns a more concise overview.
  returns: A std::string containing formatted text describing the compatibility status
    of LFG queue entries. The string includes details such as player GUIDs, roles,
    classes, levels, and matching criteria used to determine group compatibility.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debugging
    code: 'LFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetLFGQueueForPlayer(playerGuid);

      std::string dump = lfgQueue->DumpCompatibleInfo(false);

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("lfg", "LFG Queue Compatibility Info:\n%s", dump.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Full Debug Output for Development
    code: 'LFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetLFGQueueForPlayer(playerGuid);

      std::string fullDump = lfgQueue->DumpCompatibleInfo(true);

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("lfg", "Detailed LFG Queue Info:\n%s", fullDump.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and development purposes.
    The output format may change between TrinityCore versions. It should not be used
    in performance-critical code paths as it constructs a potentially large string
    with multiple data points.
  warnings: The returned string can become very large when 'full' is true, especially
    during high-traffic periods with many queued players. This could lead to memory
    overhead or performance degradation if logged excessively.
