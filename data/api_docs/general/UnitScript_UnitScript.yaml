  signature: void UnitScript::UnitScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a UnitScript instance with the specified name for script registration
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The UnitScript constructor initializes a new instance of the UnitScript
    class, associating it with a unique name identifier. This name is used internally
    by the TrinityCore scripting system to register and manage unit-related scripts.
    The constructor sets up the base script functionality required for units to respond
    to various game events such as combat, movement, and AI behaviors. It is typically
    called during the initialization phase of script loading or when dynamically creating
    new unit scripts at runtime.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated character string that serves as the unique identifier
      for this UnitScript instance. This name must be unique within the scripting
      system to prevent conflicts during registration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UnitScript Initialization
    code: "class MyCustomUnitScript : public UnitScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyCustomUnitScript()\
      \ : UnitScript(\"MyCustomUnitScript\")\n    {\n        // Script initialization\
      \ code here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Custom Unit Script with Event Handling
    code: "class BossAI : public UnitScript\n{\npublic:\n    BossAI() : UnitScript(\"\
      BossAI\")\n    {\n        // Register for combat events\n        // Initialize\
      \ boss-specific behavior\n    }\n\n    void OnCombatStart(Unit* unit) override\n\
      \    {\n        // Custom combat start logic\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The UnitScript constructor should only be called during object construction,
    not after an instance has been initialized. The name parameter is used for internal
    lookup and must remain constant throughout the script's lifetime. This constructor
    does not perform any runtime validation of the provided name; it simply stores
    it for later use in the scripting system.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same object instance,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. The name parameter
    should be a valid, non-empty string that uniquely identifies this script within
    the TrinityCore environment. Avoid using special characters or spaces in the name
    that might cause issues with internal parsing.
