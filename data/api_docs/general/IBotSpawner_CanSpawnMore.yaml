  class: IBotSpawner
  method: CanSpawnMore
  signature: bool IBotSpawner::CanSpawnMore() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether additional bot units can be spawned by this spawner instance.
  description: The CanSpawnMore method evaluates the current state of the bot spawner
    to determine if it is still capable of spawning new bot units. This check typically
    considers factors such as maximum spawn limits, available resources, or cooldown
    periods between spawns. The method returns true if more bots can be created and
    false otherwise. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and bot systems, this function
    helps manage bot population control and ensures that server performance is not
    negatively impacted by excessive bot spawning.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether additional bots can be spawned. Returns
    true if the spawner has capacity or conditions allow for more spawns; returns
    false if spawning is restricted due to limits, cooldowns, or resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (spawner->CanSpawnMore()) {\n    // Proceed with spawning a new bot\n\
      \    spawner->SpawnBot();\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no more bots can\
      \ be spawned\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"ai.bot\", \"Cannot spawn more bots at this time.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with other spawner-related methods
    like SpawnBot() and GetSpawnCount(). It may involve checking internal counters,
    server load metrics, or configuration-based limits. The result of this function
    should be treated as a dynamic condition that can change over time based on runtime
    circumstances.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value guarantees successful spawning;
    additional validation or resource allocation checks might still be required before
    actually calling the spawn method. Also, frequent calls to this method in tight
    loops may introduce performance overhead if underlying state checking is computationally
    expensive.
