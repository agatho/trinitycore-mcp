documentation:
  brief: Returns the summon type identifier for a temporary summoned creature or NPC.
  description: The GetSummonType method retrieves the type of summon that this TempSummon
    instance represents. In TrinityCore's AI and summoning system, different summon
    types dictate how the summoned unit behaves, interacts with the world, and is
    managed by the game engine. This value is typically used to determine whether
    the summon is a pet, a guard, a vehicle, or another specific type of temporary
    creature. The returned integer corresponds to predefined constants in the codebase
    that define various summon behaviors and rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the summon type. Common values include SUMMON_TYPE_CREATURE
    (0), SUMMON_TYPE_PET (1), SUMMON_TYPE_GUARDIAN (2), and others depending on the
    specific implementation and game context. The exact meaning of each value depends
    on the summon system's internal logic.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Summon Type
    code: "if (tempSummon->GetSummonType() == SUMMON_TYPE_PET)\n{\n    // Handle pet-specific\
      \ behavior\n    sLog->outString(\"This is a summoned pet.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Summon Type in AI Logic
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (TempSummon* summon = dynamic_cast<TempSummon*>(me))\n\
      \    {\n        switch (summon->GetSummonType())\n        {\n            case\
      \ SUMMON_TYPE_PET:\n                // Pet-specific logic\n                break;\n\
      \            case SUMMON_TYPE_GUARDIAN:\n                // Guardian-specific\
      \ logic\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI scripts and summon management systems
    to differentiate between various types of summoned creatures. The summon type
    affects how the creature interacts with its owner, responds to commands, and behaves
    during combat or other game events.
