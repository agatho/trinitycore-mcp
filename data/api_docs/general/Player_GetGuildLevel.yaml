documentation:
  brief: Returns the guild level of the player, which represents the current level
    of the guild member.
  description: The GetGuildLevel method retrieves the current guild level of the player
    character, which is a value indicating the rank or level within the guild. This
    method is used to determine the player's position in the guild hierarchy and can
    be useful for various game mechanics such as guild management, permissions, and
    progression tracking. The returned value typically corresponds to the player's
    guild rank level, which may vary depending on the specific guild system implementation
    in TrinityCore. This method does not require any parameters and returns a uint32
    value representing the guild level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the current guild level of the player.
    This value typically corresponds to the player's guild rank level, which can range
    from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest) depending on the guild system implementation.
    The value may also represent the player's position within the guild hierarchy
    or their progression level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 guildLevel = player->GetGuildLevel();\nif (guildLevel > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Player is a guild member\n    std::cout << \"Guild level: \" << guildLevel\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not require any special implementation
    considerations. It simply returns the current guild level value stored in the
    player's data structure without performing any complex calculations or operations.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking guild permissions,
    as it may return 0 for players who are not in a guild. Be aware that the returned
    value might vary depending on the specific TrinityCore version and guild system
    implementation.
