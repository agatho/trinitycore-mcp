  class: PlayerRelocationNotifier
  method: PlayerRelocationNotifier
  signature: void PlayerRelocationNotifier::PlayerRelocationNotifier(int & player)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PlayerRelocationNotifier instance with the specified player
    reference.
  description: The PlayerRelocationNotifier constructor initializes a relocation notifier
    object that tracks player movement within the game world. This class is typically
    used in TrinityCore's core systems to manage and broadcast player position updates
    to nearby players or entities. The constructor takes a reference to an integer
    representing the player identifier, which is then stored internally for use during
    relocation events. This mechanism ensures that player movements are properly synchronized
    across the game world and that other players or objects can be notified of positional
    changes in real-time.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Reference to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID)
      used for tracking and notification purposes. This value is typically a unique
      identifier assigned by the server to distinguish individual players within the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PlayerRelocationNotifier Initialization
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      PlayerRelocationNotifier notifier(playerId);

      // Initializes a relocation notifier for player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using PlayerRelocationNotifier in World Update Loop
    code: "void WorldUpdate()\n{\n    int currentPlayerId = GetActivePlayerGUID();\n\
      \    PlayerRelocationNotifier notifier(currentPlayerId);\n    // Notifier initialized\
      \ for current player's movement tracking\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by TrinityCore's world management
    systems when a player enters the game world or when relocation events need to
    be tracked. The notifier object maintains internal state related to player position
    and movement history, which may be used for various subsystems including visibility
    calculations, combat tracking, and packet broadcasting.
  warnings: The parameter should always reference a valid player GUID; otherwise,
    the behavior of the notifier during relocation events is undefined. Improper initialization
    can lead to incorrect positioning updates or crashes in the game world.
