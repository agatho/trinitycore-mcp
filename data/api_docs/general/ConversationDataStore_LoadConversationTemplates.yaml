  method: LoadConversationTemplates
  signature: void ConversationDataStore::LoadConversationTemplates()
documentation:
  brief: Loads conversation templates from the database into memory for use in World
    of Warcraft conversations.
  description: The LoadConversationTemplates method initializes and populates the
    internal data store with all available conversation templates stored in the database.
    This method is typically called during server startup or when the conversation
    system needs to refresh its template cache. It retrieves data such as NPC dialogue
    options, quest-related conversations, and scripted interactions, making them available
    for active conversations. The method ensures that all conversation data is properly
    loaded and validated before being used by the game's conversation system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void WorldSession::Initialize() {\n    sConversationDataStore->LoadConversationTemplates();\n\
      \    // Conversation templates are now available for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a template refresh is required. It's not thread-safe and should be executed on
    the main thread. The method performs database queries and may cause temporary
    performance overhead during loading.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in the conversation data store. Avoid calling
    this method from within active conversation handlers as it might cause race conditions
    or inconsistent state.
