  class: WorldSession

  signature: void WorldSession::SendLfgQueueStatus(const lfg::LfgQueueStatusData &
    queueData)
documentation:
  brief: Sends the LFG queue status data to the client for the player's current LFG
    activity.
  description: The SendLfgQueueStatus method is responsible for transmitting the current
    state and details of a player's Looking For Group (LFG) queue status to the client.
    This includes information about the player's position in the queue, the type of
    group they are seeking, and any relevant timers or cooldowns. The method is typically
    invoked when a player joins or updates their LFG queue status, ensuring that the
    user interface reflects the current state accurately. It plays a crucial role
    in the World of Warcraft LFG system, enabling players to see their progress and
    wait times while searching for groups.
  parameters:
  - name: queueData
    description: A constant reference to an LfgQueueStatusData structure containing
      all relevant information about the player's current LFG queue status including
      group type, dungeon ID, queue position, and waiting time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending LFG Queue Status
    code: 'lfg::LfgQueueStatusData data;

      data.dungeonId = 1234;

      data.queuePosition = 5;

      data.waitTime = 180;

      worldSession->SendLfgQueueStatus(data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client's network layer to send structured
    data packets. It should only be called when there is actual queue status data
    to transmit, as unnecessary calls may impact performance. The LFG system in TrinityCore
    relies on accurate and timely updates to maintain a smooth user experience.
