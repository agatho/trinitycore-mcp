  class: EconomyManager
  method: GatherResource
  signature: bool EconomyManager::GatherResource(const GatheringNode & node)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to gather resources from a specified gathering node, returning true
    on success or false if the operation fails.
  description: The GatherResource method is responsible for processing the act of
    collecting resources from a gathering node within the game world. It typically
    handles the logic for resource depletion, player interaction, and reward distribution.
    The method checks whether the player has the necessary permissions, tools, or
    requirements to gather from the specified node. If successful, it may update the
    node's state (e.g., reduce remaining resources) and award the player with the
    gathered items. This method is commonly used in conjunction with mining, herbalism,
    and other gathering professions within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: node
    description: A constant reference to a GatheringNode object that represents the
      specific resource node from which to gather resources. This node contains information
      about the type of resource, current quantity, and location.
  returns: Returns true if the resource gathering was successful, indicating that
    the player obtained the resources and the node state was updated accordingly.
    Returns false if the operation failed due to invalid conditions such as insufficient
    permissions, depleted resources, or other game logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Gathering
    code: "EconomyManager economyMgr;\nGatheringNode node;\n// Assume node is initialized\
      \ with valid data\nbool success = economyMgr.GatherResource(node);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Handle successful resource collection\n    printf(\"Resources gathered\
      \ successfully!\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle failure case\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to gather resources.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EconomyManager class, which manages in-game economic
    interactions such as resource gathering, trading, and crafting. The implementation
    likely includes checks for player proximity, valid tool usage, and node state
    to ensure realistic gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the GatheringNode object passed to this method is properly
    initialized and valid before calling. Passing an invalid or uninitialized node
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, note that repeated calls on a
    depleted node might result in failure unless the node is reset.
