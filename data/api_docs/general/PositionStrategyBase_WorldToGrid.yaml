documentation:
  brief: Converts a world coordinate position into grid coordinates.
  description: The WorldToGrid method transforms a given world position coordinate
    into its corresponding grid cell coordinates. This is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    map and grid management systems to determine which grid cell a particular world
    position belongs to. The method takes an integer representing a world coordinate
    and returns a pair of unsigned 32-bit integers that represent the X and Y grid
    coordinates respectively. Grid coordinates are typically used for efficient spatial
    indexing, object management, and map loading/unloading operations within the game
    world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::pair<uint32, uint32> where the first element represents the grid
    X coordinate and the second element represents the grid Y coordinate. Both values
    are unsigned 32-bit integers indicating the position of the world coordinate within
    the grid system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase strategy;

      int worldX = 1000;

      int worldY = 2000;

      // Assuming the method uses internal state or a fixed grid size

      std::pair<uint32, uint32> gridCoords = strategy.WorldToGrid(worldX);

      // gridCoords.first and gridCoords.second contain the grid coordinates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely depends on internal grid configuration parameters such
    as grid size or map dimensions. The actual implementation details may vary based
    on how the PositionStrategyBase class is specialized for different map types or
    game mechanics.
