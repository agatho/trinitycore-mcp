documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature can penetrate water.
  description: This method checks if a creature is capable of penetrating water, which
    is typically related to the creature's movement type and abilities. It returns
    true if the creature cannot penetrate water, indicating that it has specific restrictions
    or capabilities that prevent it from moving through water. This is commonly used
    in game mechanics to determine if a creature should be restricted from certain
    movement behaviors or if it has special water-based abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature cannot penetrate water, false otherwise. This
    indicates that the creature has restrictions preventing it from moving through
    water.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->CannotPenetrateWater()) {\n    // Handle creature that cannot\
      \ penetrate water\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks the creature''s movement
    type or specific abilities related to water penetration. Performance considerations:
    The check is typically fast and does not involve complex calculations.'
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods, as it may affect pathfinding and movement behavior in certain scenarios.
