documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MarketAnalysis object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the MarketAnalysis class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's market analysis functionality, this
    method ensures proper deallocation of data structures related to item pricing
    trends, auction house statistics, or other economic data that may have been collected
    or processed by the MarketAnalysis instance. This destructor is automatically
    invoked when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, ensuring no
    memory leaks occur in the game's economy simulation system.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of MarketAnalysis object
    code: "void someFunction()\n{\n    MarketAnalysis analysis;\n    // ... use analysis\
      \ ...\n} // Destructor automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of MarketAnalysis pointer
    code: 'MarketAnalysis* analysis = new MarketAnalysis();

      // ... use analysis ...

      delete analysis; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is implicitly called by the compiler and should not be invoked
    directly. It's important to ensure that all member variables are properly cleaned
    up, especially if they contain pointers or references to dynamically allocated
    memory.
