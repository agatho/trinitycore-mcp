documentation:
  brief: Moves a PlayerSocial object to another PlayerSocial object using move semantics.
  description: The PlayerSocial constructor taking an rvalue reference (move constructor)
    transfers ownership of resources from one PlayerSocial object to another. This
    is typically used when transferring a PlayerSocial instance from a temporary object
    or when moving objects within containers. The method efficiently reassigns internal
    data structures without performing deep copies, improving performance. In the
    context of TrinityCore's social system, this constructor may be invoked during
    player session management or when handling social list operations where objects
    need to be relocated rather than duplicated.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing PlayerSocial Object
    code: 'PlayerSocial social1;

      // ... populate social1 with data ...

      PlayerSocial social2 = std::move(social1); // Move constructor invoked'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor and should only be called with rvalue expressions.
    After the move, the source object's state becomes undefined but valid for destruction
    or assignment.
  warnings: Using this constructor on an already moved-from object results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the source object is not used after being moved from.
