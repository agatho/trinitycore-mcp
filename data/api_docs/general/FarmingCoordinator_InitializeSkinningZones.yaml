documentation:
  brief: Initializes skinning zones for the farming coordinator.
  description: The InitializeSkinningZones method sets up and configures all necessary
    skinning zones within the farming coordinator system. This includes registering
    zone boundaries, establishing skinning mechanics, and preparing the environment
    for player interaction with skinnable objects. The method ensures that all relevant
    areas are properly initialized before players can begin skinning activities. It
    typically runs during server startup or when the farming coordinator is first
    activated.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.InitializeSkinningZones();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    the farming coordinator. Repeated calls may result in duplicate zone registrations
    or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method after the farming coordinator has already been
    initialized with active skinning zones, as it may cause conflicts with existing
    zone data.
