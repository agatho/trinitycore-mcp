documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is a dynamic object.
  description: This method checks if the current Object instance represents a dynamic
    object within the World of Warcraft environment. Dynamic objects are entities
    that are created by spells or abilities and exist in the game world for a limited
    time, such as area of effect spells or summoned creatures. The method returns
    true when the object is a dynamic object, false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for determining object type during gameplay mechanics and spell processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is a dynamic object, false otherwise. The return
    value indicates whether the object's type matches the dynamic object category
    as defined by TrinityCore's internal object system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (obj->IsDynObject()) {\n    // Handle dynamic object\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other object type checking
    methods to determine the exact nature of an object. Implementation relies on internal
    object type flags and may vary between different object subtypes within TrinityCore.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining object type during combat
    or spell casting, as it may lead to performance issues if called frequently. Also,
    this method is not reliable for checking dynamic object types in certain edge
    cases where objects are created through complex mechanics.
