  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: CalculatePathToUnit
  signature: bool PathfindingAdapter::CalculatePathToUnit(Player * bot, Unit * target,
    MovementPath & path, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a movement path from a bot player to a target unit within a specified
    range.
  description: The CalculatePathToUnit method computes a navigable path for a given
    bot player to reach a target unit, considering the specified range. It utilizes
    the underlying pathfinding system to determine valid waypoints and returns true
    if a path is successfully calculated. This method is typically used in AI behavior
    scripts to enable bots to move toward targets such as enemies or NPCs. The path
    is stored in the provided MovementPath object for subsequent use in movement execution.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will follow
      the calculated path.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the destination for the
      bot's movement.
  - name: path
    description: Reference to a MovementPath object where the calculated waypoints
      will be stored.
  - name: range
    description: Floating-point value specifying the acceptable distance range from
      the target unit to consider the path complete.
  returns: True if a valid path was successfully calculated and stored in the MovementPath
    object; false otherwise, which may occur due to invalid inputs, unreachable targets,
    or internal pathfinding failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CalculatePathToUnit
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nMovementPath path;\nfloat range\
      \ = 2.0f;\n\nif (PathfindingAdapter::CalculatePathToUnit(bot, target, path,\
      \ range)) {\n    // Path was successfully calculated and can be used for movement\n\
      \    bot->MoveTo(path);\n} else {\n    // Failed to calculate a path\n    bot->Say(\"\
      Cannot reach target.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore's navigation mesh system. Ensure that
    the bot and target units are in valid locations within the same map and that the
    pathfinding data is properly initialized. The range parameter affects how close
    the bot must get to the target before considering the movement complete.
  warnings: Do not call this method with null pointers for bot or target, as it will
    likely result in a crash. Also, be cautious when using large range values, which
    may lead to inefficient or unrealistic path calculations.
