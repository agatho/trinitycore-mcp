  class: HostileEventBus
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: BusStats HostileEventBus::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical information about hostile events processed by the event
    bus.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a BusStats object containing detailed
    metrics and counters related to hostile events handled by the HostileEventBus.
    This includes information such as total events processed, average processing time,
    error counts, and other performance-related data. The statistics are typically
    used for monitoring system health, debugging, and optimizing AI behavior in combat
    scenarios within the TrinityCore framework. The method is thread-safe and provides
    a snapshot of current event bus activity without modifying internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BusStats object containing comprehensive statistics about hostile events,
    including counts, timing information, and error metrics. The exact structure of
    BusStats would depend on the implementation but generally includes fields like
    total_events, average_processing_time, error_count, and timestamp.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Hostile Event Statistics
    code: 'HostileEventBus& eventBus = HostileEventBus::Instance();

      BusStats stats = eventBus.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total hostile events: " << stats.total_events << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Average processing time: " << stats.average_processing_time <<
      "ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Hostile Event Bus Performance
    code: "void MonitorHostileEvents() {\n    static uint32 lastUpdate = 0;\n    uint32\
      \ currentTime = getMSTime();\n    if (currentTime - lastUpdate > 5000) { //\
      \ Update every 5 seconds\n        BusStats stats = HostileEventBus::Instance().GetStatistics();\n\
      \        if (stats.error_count > 0) {\n            sLog->outError(\"HostileEventBus\
      \ has %u errors\", stats.error_count);\n        }\n        lastUpdate = currentTime;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned BusStats object represents a point-in-time snapshot of event
    bus statistics. For real-time monitoring, repeated calls should be spaced appropriately
    to avoid performance overhead. The method does not modify any internal state of
    the HostileEventBus, making it safe for concurrent access.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency loops as it may impact
    performance if called too frequently. Also, ensure that BusStats structure members
    are properly initialized before accessing them to prevent undefined behavior.
