  brief: Sends a quest confirmation accept message to the player
  description: This method sends a quest confirmation accept message to the player,
    notifying them that they have accepted a quest. The method is used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to handle quest acceptance notifications and is typically
    called when a player accepts a quest from a questgiver. It ensures proper communication
    between the game server and client regarding quest acceptance status.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that was accepted by the player. This
      parameter must not be null and represents the specific quest being accepted.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who accepted the quest. This parameter
      must not be null and represents the recipient of the confirmation message.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Quest* quest = new Quest();

      player->SendQuestConfirmAccept(quest, player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the framework when a player
    accepts a quest. It may involve sending a packet to the client that includes quest
    information and confirmation status. The method should be called only after proper
    validation of the quest and player objects.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper validation of
    parameters. Calling it with null pointers can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
    Ensure that both quest and receiver parameters are valid before calling this method.
