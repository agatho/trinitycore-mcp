documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PlayerbotMigrationMgr class.
  description: The PlayerbotMigrationMgr constructor initializes the migration manager
    for player bot functionality within the TrinityCore server. This class is responsible
    for handling the migration process of player bots from one state or configuration
    to another, typically during server updates, account transfers, or when transitioning
    between different bot behavior modes. The initialization process sets up internal
    data structures and prepares the manager to handle bot migration operations. This
    constructor does not require any parameters as it initializes default settings
    and configurations needed for the migration process.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a PlayerbotMigrationMgr instance
    code: 'PlayerbotMigrationMgr migrationMgr;

      // The constructor is called automatically when creating an instance

      // No explicit call to the constructor is needed in user code'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor, so it's automatically invoked when a PlayerbotMigrationMgr
    object is created. Developers should be aware that this class likely manages internal
    state related to player bot configurations and may require proper initialization
    before performing migration operations.
