  brief: Adds extra attacks to a spell's effect.
  description: This method adds additional attack instances to a spell's effect, typically
    used in conjunction with weapon-based attacks or when implementing special abilities
    that generate extra attacks. The method modifies the spell's effect to include
    extra attacks, which can be useful for handling various game mechanics such as
    proc effects, talent-based extra attacks, or special abilities that increase attack
    frequency. It is commonly used in scenarios where a spell needs to be modified
    to include additional attack components beyond its standard behavior.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell processing or when handling
    special effects that require additional attack components. It may be used in conjunction
    with other methods like Spell::SetEffect or Spell::AddEffect to properly configure
    the spell's behavior.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may affect the overall
    spell execution and could potentially cause issues if not properly integrated
    into existing spell logic. Ensure that extra attacks are handled correctly in
    relation to other spell components.
