  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ShouldUseCrowdControl() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should apply crowd control abilities based on current
    combat state and target conditions.
  description: The ShouldUseCrowdControl method evaluates the current AI state, target
    threat level, and available crowd control abilities to decide if it's appropriate
    to use a crowd control spell or ability. This method is typically used within
    the AdaptiveBehaviorManager's decision-making process to dynamically adjust combat
    tactics based on evolving battlefield conditions. The evaluation considers factors
    such as target mobility, player health status, and the presence of other active
    crowd control effects on the target.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should apply a crowd control ability at this moment;
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the current conditions
    are favorable for using crowd control, while false suggests that either no suitable
    opportunity exists or another tactic is more appropriate.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (adaptiveManager.ShouldUseCrowdControl()) {\n    // Attempt to apply\
      \ a crowd control ability\n    unit->CastSpell(target, CrowdControlSpellId,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Decision Making
    code: "bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::UpdateCombatStrategy(Unit* target) {\n  \
      \  if (ShouldUseCrowdControl()) {\n        // Prioritize crowd control over\
      \ other abilities\n        return UseCrowdControlAbility(target);\n    }\n \
      \   // Continue with normal combat logic\n    return UseNormalAbilities(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive AI system and may be called frequently
    during combat updates. It's designed to be lightweight and should not perform
    expensive operations. The decision-making process considers both immediate tactical
    needs and long-term strategic goals.
  warnings: Do not assume that this method will always return true when crowd control
    is needed; it may return false even if the AI has available crowd control abilities
    due to game state constraints or tactical considerations. Always validate the
    target's eligibility for crowd control before attempting to cast.
