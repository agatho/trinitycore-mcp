  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: CreateFromTemplate
  signature: std::shared_ptr<BotSession> BotSessionFactory::CreateFromTemplate(const
    std::string & templateName, int characterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot session instance based on a specified template and character
    GUID.
  description: The CreateFromTemplate method instantiates a new BotSession object
    using a predefined template identified by its name. It associates the new session
    with a specific player character through the provided character GUID. This method
    is typically used in bot management systems to dynamically generate bot behavior
    configurations based on pre-defined templates. The created session will inherit
    properties and settings from the specified template while maintaining a unique
    association with the given character. The method ensures proper initialization
    of the bot session before returning it to the caller.
  parameters:
  - name: templateName
    description: The name of the template to use for creating the bot session. This
      should correspond to a valid template defined in the system's template registry.
  - name: characterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character that the bot session
      will be associated with. Must be a valid existing character GUID in the database.
  returns: A shared pointer to the newly created BotSession object. Returns nullptr
    if the template name is invalid, the character GUID does not exist, or if there
    was an error during session creation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic bot session creation
    code: "auto session = sessionFactory->CreateFromTemplate(\"warrior_template\"\
      , 12345);\nif (session)\n{\n    // Successfully created bot session\n    session->Start();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error handling for invalid template
    code: "auto session = sessionFactory->CreateFromTemplate(\"nonexistent_template\"\
      , 12345);\nif (!session)\n{\n    // Handle error - template not found or invalid\
      \ character GUID\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to create bot session from\
      \ template 'nonexistent_template'\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs validation on both the template name and character GUID
    before creating the session. The returned BotSession object is fully initialized
    and ready for use, but may require additional setup depending on the specific
    template. Consider thread safety when calling this method from multiple threads
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the template name exists in the system's template registry;
    otherwise, the method will return nullptr. Also ensure that the character GUID
    corresponds to an existing character in the database, as invalid GUIDs may cause
    undefined behavior or crashes.
