  brief: Triggers a group event for the player when a quest completes
  description: This method handles the completion of a quest within a group context,
    allowing the player to participate in group-based quest events. It typically occurs
    when a player's quest progress is updated and the quest has been completed, enabling
    proper handling of group-related quest rewards and events. The method ensures
    that group members receive appropriate credit for quest completion and related
    event handling.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that has completed. This is used
      to identify which quest event should be triggered.
  - name: pEventObject
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the event object associated with
      the quest completion. This typically represents the quest objective or related
      event data that triggers the group event.
  returns: null

      player->GroupEventHappens(12345, &eventObject);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when a quest is completed within a group context.
    It's important to ensure that the player is part of a group before calling this
    method, as it may not function properly otherwise. The event object parameter
    should represent valid quest-related data.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest completion handling
    and may cause group members to miss out on rewards. Ensure that the questId and
    eventObject are valid before calling this method.
