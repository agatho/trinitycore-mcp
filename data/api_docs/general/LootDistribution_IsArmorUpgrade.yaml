  signature: bool LootDistribution::IsArmorUpgrade(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a loot item represents an armor upgrade for the specified
    player.
  description: The IsArmorUpgrade method evaluates whether a given loot item provides
    an improvement in armor rating compared to the player's current equipped armor.
    This check is typically used during loot distribution to determine if an item
    should be considered as an upgrade, potentially affecting how the item is awarded
    or displayed to the player. The method takes into account the player's current
    gear and the properties of the loot item to make this determination.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the armor upgrade check is
      being performed. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing information about
      the item being evaluated for armor upgrade status.
  returns: Returns true if the loot item provides an armor upgrade for the specified
    player; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Distribution
    code: "if (lootDist.IsArmorUpgrade(player, item)) {\n    // Handle armor upgrade\
      \ logic\n    player->SendLootUpdate();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Item Awarding Based on Upgrade Status
    code: "bool isUpgrade = lootDist.IsArmorUpgrade(player, item);\nif (isUpgrade)\
      \ {\n    // Award upgrade notification\n    player->SendNotification(\"New armor\
      \ upgrade available!\");\n} else {\n    // Regular loot handling\n    player->AddItem(item.itemid,\
      \ item.count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal player gear comparison logic and may involve
    performance considerations when evaluating multiple items. It should only be called
    with valid Player and LootItem objects to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null reference will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, the
    item structure must contain valid armor-related properties for accurate evaluation.
