documentation:
  brief: Sends an encounter end event to all players in the instance, triggering the
    completion of a dungeon or raid encounter.
  description: The SendEncounterEnd method is used within TrinityCore's InstanceScript
    framework to notify all players currently present in an instance that a dungeon
    or raid encounter has concluded. This method typically sends relevant packets
    to update the client-side UI, remove encounter-related events, and potentially
    trigger rewards or progression mechanics. It is commonly called when an encounter
    reaches its natural conclusion, such as defeating a boss or completing a specific
    objective sequence. The method does not take any parameters and performs no return
    value operations, serving purely as a notification mechanism for the instance's
    encounter state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Boss Encounter Completion
    code: "class BossEncounterScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnBossDeath() override\n    {\n        // Perform boss-specific cleanup\n\
      \        // ...\n        SendEncounterEnd(); // Notify players that the encounter\
      \ is over\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within an InstanceScript context where
    players are actively engaged in an encounter. It relies on the instance's internal
    state to determine which players receive the notification. Calling this method
    outside of a valid encounter context may result in unintended behavior or no effect.
