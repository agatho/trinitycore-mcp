  class: HunterAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float HunterAI::GetOptimalRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the hunter based on current
    target and weapon type.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    hunter should engage their target for maximum effectiveness. This calculation
    takes into account the hunter's current weapon range, the target's movement state,
    and various combat mechanics specific to the Hunter class in World of Warcraft.
    The returned float value represents the distance in yards where the hunter should
    position themselves for optimal damage output or ability usage. This method is
    typically used internally by the AI system to make decisions about when to move,
    shoot, or change positioning during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal attack range in yards. This distance
    indicates where the hunter should position themselves relative to their target
    for maximum effectiveness. The value is typically between the minimum and maximum
    weapon ranges of the hunter's current equipped weapon, adjusted for combat situation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float optimalRange = hunterAI->GetOptimalRange();\nif (hunterAI->GetRangeToTarget()\
      \ > optimalRange)\n{\n    // Move closer to target\n    hunterAI->MoveToTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches its results or recalculates based on current combat
    state. It may consider factors such as weapon type, target mobility, and environmental
    obstacles. The implementation might be influenced by hunter talents that modify
    ranged attack mechanics.
  warnings: The returned range value should not be used directly for movement commands
    without considering other AI factors like threat level, target position, or environmental
    constraints. This method may return unexpected values if called outside of a proper
    combat context.
