    const
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes combat data from a bot and target to extract relevant features for
    behavior adaptation.
  description: The ExtractCombatFeatures method processes combat-related information
    between a player bot and a target unit to identify key behavioral features that
    can be used for AI adaptation. This method likely evaluates factors such as damage
    dealt, healing received, combat stance, spell usage patterns, and other tactical
    data points. It serves as a core component in TrinityCore's AI system for dynamically
    adjusting bot behavior based on real-time combat analysis. The method requires
    valid player and target pointers to function correctly and returns an integer
    code indicating success or failure of the feature extraction process.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI-controlled character
      whose combat features are being analyzed
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the opponent or target being
      engaged in combat
  returns: Returns an integer value where positive values typically indicate successful
    feature extraction, zero may represent no features found, and negative values
    likely denote errors or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExtractCombatFeatures
    code: "int result = behaviorAdaptation->ExtractCombatFeatures(botPlayer, targetUnit);\n\
      if (result > 0) {\n    // Successfully extracted combat features\n    printf(\"\
      Extracted %d combat features\\n\", result);\n} else if (result == 0) {\n   \
      \ // No features found\n    printf(\"No combat features detected\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Error occurred during feature extraction\n    printf(\"Feature extraction\
      \ failed with code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI decision-making framework in TrinityCore.
    It may involve complex combat analysis logic that considers multiple factors including
    spell cooldowns, health percentages, and combat timing. The returned integer value
    should be interpreted according to the specific implementation's error code conventions.
  warnings: Ensure both bot and target parameters are valid pointers before calling
    this method to prevent null pointer dereferences. The method may have performance
    implications when called frequently during active combat scenarios.
