  class: PlayerbotConfig
  method: ValidateDatabaseSettings
  signature: bool PlayerbotConfig::ValidateDatabaseSettings()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the database configuration settings for player bot functionality.
  description: The ValidateDatabaseSettings method checks whether the database connection
    and configuration parameters required for player bot operations are correctly
    set up. It verifies that essential database tables, fields, and connection details
    exist and are properly configured. This method is typically called during system
    initialization or when player bot features are enabled to ensure all necessary
    database resources are available. The validation includes checking for valid connection
    strings, required table structures, and proper field definitions needed by the
    player bot AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all database settings are valid and properly configured,
    false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that one or more database configuration
    issues were detected that would prevent player bot functionality from operating
    correctly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "if (playerbotConfig.ValidateDatabaseSettings()) {\n    // Database settings\
      \ are valid, proceed with player bot initialization\n    playerbotConfig.InitializePlayerBots();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid database configuration\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Player bot database configuration is invalid\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs essential pre-flight checks before player bot systems
    can operate. It should be called early in the server startup process to catch
    configuration errors before they cause runtime issues. The validation may involve
    database queries and could have performance implications during server initialization.
  warnings: This method should not be called during active gameplay as it may perform
    database operations that could impact performance or cause locking issues. If
    validation fails, player bot features will be disabled until the configuration
    is corrected.
