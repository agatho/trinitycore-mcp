  method: GetCaptain
  signature: int ArenaTeam::GetCaptain() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the arena team captain.
  description: The GetCaptain method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    player who currently holds the captain position within the arena team. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, each arena team has exactly one captain
    who has elevated privileges such as managing team members and setting team achievements.
    This method provides access to the captain's GUID which can be used to retrieve
    further information about the player, such as their name or current online status.
    The returned value represents a 32-bit unsigned integer that uniquely identifies
    the captain within the game world's database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the arena team captain. If
    the arena team has no captain assigned (which should not normally occur), it may
    return 0 or a special invalid value depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Captain GUID
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    uint32 captainGuid = team->GetCaptain();\n    if (captainGuid)\n    {\n\
      \        // Use the captain GUID to look up player information\n        Player*\
      \ captain = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(MAKE_NEW_GUID(captainGuid, 0, HIGHGUID_PLAYER));\n\
      \        if (captain)\n        {\n            sLog->outString(\"Captain of team\
      \ %u is %s\", team->GetId(), captain->GetName().c_str());\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the arena team object is properly initialized and
    contains valid captain data. The GUID returned should be used with appropriate
    macros like MAKE_NEW_GUID to construct a proper ObjectGuid for player lookups.
    Performance-wise, this is a simple getter operation with no significant overhead.
  warnings: Be aware that if an arena team has not been properly initialized or if
    the captain has left the game, this method might return invalid data. Always validate
    the returned GUID before using it to access player objects to prevent crashes
    or undefined behavior.
