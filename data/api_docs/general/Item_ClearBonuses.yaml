  signature: void Item::ClearBonuses()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all active enchantment and bonus effects from the item.
  description: The ClearBonuses method strips all temporary enchantments, stat bonuses,
    and applied modifiers from an Item instance. This operation is typically used
    when an item's state needs to be reset, such as during item destruction, transfer
    between players, or when applying new enchantments. The method ensures that no
    residual bonus effects remain on the item after execution. It operates on the
    item's internal bonus tracking system and does not affect the base item properties
    or its database representation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear bonuses from a player's equipped weapon
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* weapon = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0,\
      \ EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND);\nif (weapon)\n{\n    weapon->ClearBonuses();\n \
      \   player->SendEquipError(EQUIP_ERR_NONE, weapon, NULL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset item bonuses before applying new enchantments
    code: "void ApplyNewEnchantment(Player* player, Item* item, uint32 enchantId)\n\
      {\n    item->ClearBonuses();\n    player->ApplyEnchantment(item, PERM_ENCHANTMENT_SLOT,\
      \ false);\n    // ... additional logic for applying enchantment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not remove permanent enchantments or item upgrades; it only
    clears temporary bonuses. The operation is atomic and safe to call from any thread
    context where the item object is accessible. It may trigger client-side updates
    if the item is currently equipped or displayed.
  warnings: Calling ClearBonuses on an item that is currently equipped will cause
    visual inconsistencies until the client receives updated information about the
    item's state. Ensure proper synchronization with the player's UI and inventory
    systems after calling this method.
