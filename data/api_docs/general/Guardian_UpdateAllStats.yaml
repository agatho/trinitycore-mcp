  signature: bool Guardian::UpdateAllStats()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all statistics and attributes for the guardian unit.
  description: The UpdateAllStats method recalculates and applies all statistical
    modifiers, attributes, and combat-related values for a Guardian unit. This includes
    updating health, mana, armor, attack power, spell power, and other derived statistics
    based on the guardian's current state, level, and any active buffs or debuffs.
    The method ensures that the guardian's stats are synchronized with its base values
    and any temporary modifications. It typically gets called during initialization,
    after stat changes, or when the guardian's state is modified to maintain accurate
    gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the stat update was successful and all values were properly
    recalculated; returns false if an error occurred during the update process or
    if the guardian object is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (guardian->UpdateAllStats()) {\n    // Stats successfully updated\n\
      \    printf(\"Guardian stats updated successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ update failure\n    printf(\"Failed to update guardian stats\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger recalculations for multiple derived statistics, which
    can be computationally expensive if called frequently. It's recommended to only
    call this when necessary, such as after significant stat changes or initialization.
