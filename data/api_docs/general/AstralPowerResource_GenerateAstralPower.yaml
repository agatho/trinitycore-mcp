  class: AstralPowerResource
  method: GenerateAstralPower
  signature: void AstralPowerResource::GenerateAstralPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates astral power for the player or unit, increasing their resource
    pool by the specified amount.
  description: The GenerateAstralPower method is used to add a given amount of astral
    power to the resource pool of the associated player or game object. This method
    typically corresponds to abilities or effects that restore or generate astral
    power, such as certain spells, talents, or passive abilities in the game. The
    generated power is added directly to the existing astral power value, up to the
    maximum allowed by the system. It is commonly invoked during spell casting, periodic
    effects, or resource regeneration mechanics. This method does not perform any
    validation on the input amount and assumes that the caller has ensured the value
    is within acceptable bounds.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of astral power to be generated and added to the resource
      pool. Must be a non-negative integer. Values exceeding system limits may be
      clamped or handled according to internal logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: player->GetAstralPowerResource()->GenerateAstralPower(50);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Spell Effect
    code: "void SpellEffectAstralRegen(SpellEffIndex effIndex)\n{\n    if (Unit* target\
      \ = GetHitUnit())\n    {\n        if (Player* player = target->ToPlayer())\n\
      \        {\n            player->GetAstralPowerResource()->GenerateAstralPower(100);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AstralPowerResource class, which manages the resource
    system for astral power in TrinityCore. It directly modifies the internal resource
    value and may trigger UI updates or event notifications depending on implementation
    details. The method assumes that the object it's called on has a valid AstralPowerResource
    instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount passed to this method is non-negative and within
    reasonable bounds to prevent overflow or unexpected behavior. Direct calls without
    checking for valid targets or conditions may lead to unintended gameplay effects.
