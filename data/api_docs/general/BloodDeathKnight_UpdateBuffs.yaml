documentation:
  brief: Updates the buff states and effects for the Blood Death Knight class.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and applying all
    active buffs and debuffs specific to the Blood Death Knight specialization. This
    includes handling aura applications, updating stat modifiers, and ensuring that
    the player's combat effectiveness reflects their current buff status. The method
    typically runs during the AI update cycle or when buff states change due to spell
    effects, abilities, or environmental conditions. It ensures that all Blood Death
    Knight-specific buffs such as Blood Presence, Heart Strike, and other class-based
    enhancements are properly maintained and applied to the player character.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BloodDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic ...\n    m_player->GetBloodDeathKnight()->UpdateBuffs();\n    // ...\
      \ rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core AI system during regular
    update cycles. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom buff management logic. The method may trigger additional callbacks or events
    when buff states change, which can affect other systems.
  warnings: Calling UpdateBuffs manually outside of the standard AI update flow may
    cause unexpected behavior or inconsistencies in buff application. Ensure that
    any custom usage respects the game's timing and state management protocols.
