  signature: void ManaHolyPowerResource::Regenerate(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the mana and holy power resource values based on the elapsed time
    since last update.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for updating the mana and holy
    power resource values of a player or creature over time. It processes the time
    difference (diff) passed as a parameter to determine how much resource should
    be regenerated. This method typically gets called during game ticks or periodic
    updates to simulate natural resource regeneration in World of Warcraft. The regeneration
    rate may vary based on class, talents, buffs, and other game mechanics. This method
    does not directly modify any external state but rather adjusts internal resource
    counters within the ManaHolyPowerResource object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'ManaHolyPowerResource resource;

      uint32 deltaTime = 1000; // 1 second

      resource.Regenerate(deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdatePlayerResources(Player* player, uint32 diff) {\n    if (player->GetManaHolyPowerResource())\
      \ {\n        player->GetManaHolyPowerResource()->Regenerate(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the game's main update loop or resource
    management system. It's important to ensure that the 'diff' parameter accurately
    reflects the time elapsed since the last regeneration tick to maintain consistent
    gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without proper context, as it may interfere
    with other resource management systems. Ensure that the resource object is properly
    initialized before calling Regenerate.
