api:
  class: Battleground
  method: GetTeamIndexByTeamId
  signature: int Battleground::GetTeamIndexByTeamId(int team)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the team index corresponding to the given team ID in a battleground.
  description: The GetTeamIndexByTeamId method maps a team identifier (typically 0
    or 1) to an internal team index used within the battleground system. This is commonly
    used to determine which team a player belongs to during battleground events, such
    as capturing objectives or calculating victory conditions. The method ensures
    that team IDs are properly translated into indices for internal operations, supporting
    game logic that requires distinguishing between opposing teams. It assumes valid
    team IDs are passed and does not perform bounds checking on the input value.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team ID to convert to a team index. Typically 0 or 1, representing
      the two opposing teams in a battleground.
  returns: An integer representing the internal team index corresponding to the provided
    team ID. For standard battlegrounds with two teams, this will typically be 0 or
    1.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine team index
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(123);

      int teamIndex = bg->GetTeamIndexByTeamId(0);

      // teamIndex will be 0 for the first team'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using team index to access team-specific data
    code: "Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(123);\nuint32 teamId = 1;\n\
      int teamIndex = bg->GetTeamIndexByTeamId(teamId);\nif (teamIndex >= 0 && teamIndex\
      \ < MAX_TEAMS)\n{\n    // Access team-specific data using teamIndex\n    TeamData&\
      \ teamData = bg->m_TeamData[teamIndex];\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used internally by battleground systems to manage team-based
    logic. The mapping from team ID to index should be consistent with how teams are
    initialized in the battleground class. It's recommended to validate that the input
    team ID is within expected bounds before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing invalid team IDs (e.g., values outside of 0 or 1) may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect indexing. Ensure that the team ID corresponds
    to a valid team in the battleground context before invoking this method.
