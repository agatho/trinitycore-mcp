  class: LFGQueue
  method: AddToNewQueue
  signature: void LFGQueue::AddToNewQueue(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to a new LFG (Looking for Group) queue using their GUID.
  description: The AddToNewQueue method is responsible for placing a player into a
    new Looking for Group queue within the TrinityCore framework. This function typically
    gets invoked when a player initiates a new group search, such as joining a dungeon
    or raid queue. It handles the internal management of the LFG system by associating
    the player's unique identifier (GUID) with the appropriate queue structure. The
    method ensures that the player is properly registered in the LFG system and ready
    to be matched with other players seeking similar group content. This function
    is part of the core LFG queue management logic and is usually called as a result
    of player interaction with the LFG interface or through quest triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be added to the new
      LFG queue. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game world and
      is typically obtained from player objects or database entries.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player object\nLFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetLFGQueue(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      if (lfgQueue)\n{\n    lfgQueue->AddToNewQueue(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LFG system upon player
    request. It assumes that the player has already been validated and is eligible
    to join an LFG queue. The GUID parameter should be verified for validity before
    calling this function to prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes within the LFG system. Ensure proper validation of player
    state and GUID before invoking this method.
