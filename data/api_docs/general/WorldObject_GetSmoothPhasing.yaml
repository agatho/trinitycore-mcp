  signature: const SmoothPhasing * WorldObject::GetSmoothPhasing() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the smooth phasing data structure associated with this
    WorldObject.
  description: The GetSmoothPhasing method retrieves a constant pointer to the SmoothPhasing
    object that contains phasing-related data for the WorldObject. This data typically
    includes information about how the object should be phased in relation to other
    objects or players within the game world. The returned pointer may be null if
    no smooth phasing data has been initialized for this object. This method is primarily
    used internally by the TrinityCore engine to manage object visibility and interaction
    based on phasing rules, particularly in scenarios involving dynamic phasing systems
    such as those used for instance phasing or area-based visibility changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a SmoothPhasing object if phasing data exists for
    this WorldObject; otherwise, returns nullptr. The returned pointer should not
    be modified directly as it points to internal engine data structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Phasing Data
    code: "const SmoothPhasing* phasing = player->GetSmoothPhasing();\nif (phasing\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Object has smooth phasing data\n    // Access phasing\
      \ properties here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Phasing Information for Visibility Logic
    code: "WorldObject* object = GetWorldObject();\nconst SmoothPhasing* phasing =\
      \ object->GetSmoothPhasing();\nif (phasing && phasing->HasPhasingData())\n{\n\
      \    // Apply custom visibility logic based on phasing\n    uint32 phaseId =\
      \ phasing->GetPhaseId();\n    // Use phaseId for conditional rendering or interaction\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with phasing systems to determine
    object visibility and interaction. The returned SmoothPhasing pointer should not
    be deleted or modified directly as it's managed by the engine. Performance-wise,
    this is a fast lookup operation that returns a cached pointer.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned SmoothPhasing pointer as it points to internal
    engine data structures. Accessing phasing data may result in null pointer dereference
    if no phasing has been initialized for the object.
