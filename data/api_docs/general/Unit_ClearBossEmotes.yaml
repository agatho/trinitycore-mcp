  signature: void Unit::ClearBossEmotes(int zoneId, const int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Clears boss emotes in specified zone for target unit
  description: This method removes all boss emotes from the specified zone for a given
    target unit. It is used to reset boss encounter behavior and prevent emote conflicts
    during encounters. The method operates on a per-zone basis and can be called with
    or without specifying a target unit, making it flexible for different encounter
    scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The zone ID where boss emotes should be cleared. This parameter determines
      which zone the emotes are removed from.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to target unit whose emotes should be cleared. If nullptr,
      all emotes in zone are cleared for all units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear boss emotes in zone 1234
    code: 'Unit* pTarget = GetTarget();

      Unit::ClearBossEmotes(1234, pTarget);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely uses internal emote tracking
    systems to remove boss-specific emotes from the target unit. Performance considerations:
    Should be called carefully during active encounters as it may affect boss behavior
    and encounter progression.'
  warnings: This method should not be used during active boss encounters without proper
    understanding of its effects on encounter mechanics. Using with nullptr target
    may clear all emotes in zone, which could disrupt normal boss behavior.
