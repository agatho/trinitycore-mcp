documentation:
  brief: Resets the boss AI state, clearing all active abilities and restoring initial
    conditions.
  description: The _Reset method is a core component of the BossAI class in TrinityCore's
    AI system. It is responsible for resetting the boss creature's AI state to its
    initial configuration, typically called during boss encounters when the fight
    is restarted or when a boss needs to be reset after being defeated. This method
    clears any active spells, resets combat states, and ensures that all AI-related
    flags and timers are properly initialized. The method is usually invoked internally
    by the framework during encounter management, such as when a boss is pulled from
    a reset state or when transitioning between phases of an encounter.

  - title: Basic Usage in Boss AI Override
    code: "class MyBossAI : public BossAI\n{\npublic:\n    MyBossAI(Creature* creature)\
      \ : BossAI(creature) {}\n\n    void Reset() override\n    {\n        BossAI::_Reset();\n\
      \        // Additional reset logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI framework and should
    not be invoked directly unless implementing custom boss AI behavior. It's important
    to note that _Reset() does not handle creature despawning or destruction; it only
    resets the AI state.
