    * trigger)
documentation:
  brief: Handles player exit from an area trigger, allowing custom logic execution
  description: The OnExit method is invoked when a player leaves an area trigger zone.
    This virtual method provides a hook for custom scripts to execute specific behavior
    when a player exits a defined area trigger. The method receives the player object
    and the area trigger entry data as parameters. Returning true typically indicates
    that the default handling should be skipped, while returning false allows normal
    processing to continue. This method is commonly used in custom area trigger implementations
    to control quest progression, activate events, or modify player state upon leaving
    a trigger zone.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is exiting the area trigger. This
      parameter represents the specific player instance that triggered the exit event.
  - name: trigger
    description: Pointer to the AreaTriggerEntry structure containing data about the
      area trigger being exited. This provides access to trigger properties such as
      ID, position, and other configuration values.
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether default processing should be skipped (true)
    or allowed to proceed (false). Returning true prevents standard area trigger exit
    behavior from executing.

    code: "class MyAreaTriggerScript : public AreaTriggerScript\n{\npublic:\n    bool\
      \ OnExit(Player* player, const AreaTriggerEntry* trigger) override\n    {\n\
      \        // Log the exit event\n        LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Player {} exited\
      \ area trigger {}\", player->GetName(), trigger->ID);\n        \n        //\
      \ Allow normal processing to continue\n        return false;\n    }\n};"

  - title: Area Trigger Exit with Quest Completion
    code: "class QuestAreaTriggerScript : public AreaTriggerScript\n{\npublic:\n \
      \   bool OnExit(Player* player, const AreaTriggerEntry* trigger) override\n\
      \    {\n        // Check if player has the required quest\n        if (player->GetQuestStatus(12345)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n        {\n            // Complete the quest\n\
      \            player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n            \n            // Prevent\
      \ default behavior to avoid duplicate completion\n            return true;\n\
      \        }\n        \n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AreaTriggerScript base class and should be overridden
    in derived classes. The method is called from the game's core area trigger system,
    so performance considerations are important for frequently used triggers. Be careful
    not to perform heavy operations that could block the game loop.
  warnings: Do not modify player state in ways that could cause instability or infinite
    loops. Avoid calling methods that might recursively trigger area trigger events.
    Returning true should be used sparingly as it bypasses standard area trigger exit
    handling.
