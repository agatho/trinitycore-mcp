documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement state of a specified player group within the bot system.
  description: The UpdateGroupMovement method is responsible for synchronizing and
    updating the movement behavior of a player group managed by the Playerbot system.
    This method ensures that all bots in the specified group maintain coordinated
    movement patterns, such as following a leader or moving together in formation.
    It typically handles pathfinding updates, position synchronization, and movement
    state transitions for the entire group. The method operates on a group identifier
    to target specific bot groups within the system's management scope.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the player group whose movement needs to be
      updated. This ID corresponds to a registered group in the PlayerbotGroupManager
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Movement for Group ID 5
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      groupMgr->UpdateGroupMovement(5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger internal pathfinding recalculations for all members
    of the group. It should be called periodically to maintain group cohesion during
    dynamic gameplay scenarios.
