  class: MarksmanshipCastManager
  method: CanStartCast
  signature: bool MarksmanshipCastManager::CanStartCast() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a marksman character can begin casting a spell based on
    current game state and constraints.
  description: The CanStartCast method evaluates various conditions to determine if
    a marksman class player is eligible to initiate a new spell cast. This includes
    checking for active spell restrictions, combat status, resource availability,
    and other gameplay mechanics specific to the Marksmanship specialization. The
    method typically returns true when all prerequisites are met and false otherwise,
    ensuring that players cannot cast spells under invalid conditions such as being
    stunned, silenced, or lacking required resources like mana or focus. This check
    is essential for maintaining game balance and preventing unintended behavior during
    combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the marksman can start casting a spell; otherwise returns
    false. A return value of false typically indicates that a casting restriction
    is currently active, such as being in a state that prevents spellcasting (e.g.,
    stunned, silenced, or in an invalid combat stance).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (marksmanshipManager->CanStartCast()) {\n    // Proceed with casting\
      \ logic\n    player->CastSpell(target);\n} else {\n    // Handle inability to\
      \ cast\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Cannot start casting at this time.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during gameplay, so performance should
    be considered. It may internally check multiple flags and states, including player
    status effects, spell cooldowns, and resource levels. The implementation might
    also integrate with TrinityCore's core spell system to ensure consistency with
    global game rules.
  warnings: Do not assume that a successful return from this method guarantees the
    spell will complete successfully; additional checks may occur during the actual
    casting process. Also, calling this method in rapid succession without proper
    state management could lead to inconsistent behavior if underlying conditions
    change between checks.
