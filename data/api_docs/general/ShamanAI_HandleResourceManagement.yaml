documentation:
  brief: Manages resource allocation and usage for shaman AI behavior.
  description: The HandleResourceManagement method is responsible for overseeing the
    allocation and utilization of resources such as mana, totems, and spell cooldowns
    within the ShamanAI class. This method ensures that the shaman AI makes optimal
    decisions regarding when and how to use its available resources during combat.
    It evaluates current resource levels, determines priority actions based on game
    state, and manages the timing of resource consumption to maximize effectiveness.
    The method typically integrates with the broader AI decision-making framework
    to maintain efficient resource usage throughout different phases of encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if resource management was successfully handled and the AI
    state was updated accordingly; returns false if no action was taken or if resource
    management failed due to invalid conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!HandleResourceManagement())\n\
      \    {\n        // Fallback behavior if resource management fails\n        DoFallbackBehavior();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may affect
    spell casting decisions, totem placement timing, and overall combat strategy.
    It's important to note that resource management decisions are context-dependent
    and may vary based on current target, health status, and encounter phase.
