  signature: void Player::SetActiveCombatTraitConfigID(int32 traitConfigId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the active combat trait configuration ID for the player.
  description: This method configures the player's active combat trait system by setting
    a specific trait configuration ID. The trait configuration ID determines which
    combat traits are active and available to the player during combat. This method
    is typically used in conjunction with other trait-related functions to manage
    player character progression and specialization. It affects the player's ability
    to use combat traits and influences their gameplay mechanics during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: traitConfigId
    description: The unique identifier for the combat trait configuration to be set.
      This value determines which traits are active and available to the player during
      combat. Valid values are typically positive integers representing specific trait
      configurations, with negative values indicating invalid or unset states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Combat Trait Configuration
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetActiveCombatTraitConfigID(12345);

      // This sets the active combat trait configuration to ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Trait Configuration with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nint32 configId = 54321;\nif (configId >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    player->SetActiveCombatTraitConfigID(configId);\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   // Handle invalid configuration ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player initialization or when changing
    combat traits. The trait configuration ID must be valid and correspond to an existing
    trait configuration in the game database. Implementation may involve updating
    internal state variables and potentially triggering UI updates for the player's
    combat trait display.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to invalid trait configurations,
    which may cause gameplay issues or prevent proper trait activation. Care should
    be taken when setting trait configuration IDs to ensure they correspond to valid
    entries in the database.
