  class: IcicleTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void IcicleTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the icicle tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in IcicleTracker is responsible for processing and
    maintaining the state of icicle-related data for a given player bot. This method
    typically handles logic such as tracking icicle accumulation, updating cooldowns,
    managing visual effects, or synchronizing icicle status with the game world. It
    is designed to be called periodically during the bot's update cycle to ensure
    accurate and timely state management. The method operates on the provided Player
    object and modifies internal tracker state based on game mechanics and player
    actions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose icicle tracking
      state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Player* bot = GetBot())\n\
      \    {\n        icicleTracker.Update(bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Icicle Mechanics
    code: "void IcicleBot::OnUpdate()\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        // Perform custom icicle logic before updating tracker\n   \
      \     HandleIcicleGrowth(player);\n        \n        // Update the tracker state\n\
      \        icicleTracker.Update(player);\n        \n        // Apply any post-update\
      \ effects\n        ApplyIcicleEffects(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the bot's update cycle to avoid
    race conditions. The IcicleTracker class likely maintains internal state that
    depends on time-based events or player actions, so calling Update at appropriate
    intervals is crucial for accurate behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null. Passing an invalid pointer may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method modifies the internal state of the IcicleTracker, so it should not
    be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
