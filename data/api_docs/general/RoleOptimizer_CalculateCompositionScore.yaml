  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: CalculateCompositionScore
  signature: float RoleOptimizer::CalculateCompositionScore(const int & assignments,
    const int & players, OptimizationGoal goal)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a composition score based on player assignments and optimization
    goal for role distribution.
  description: The CalculateCompositionScore method evaluates how well a given set
    of player role assignments aligns with a specified optimization goal. It takes
    into account the number of players and their current assignments to determine
    a numerical score representing the effectiveness of the role composition. This
    score is typically used in group dynamics or raid planning systems to assess whether
    a particular distribution of roles (such as tanks, healers, and damage dealers)
    meets desired objectives like maximizing damage output or ensuring adequate survivability.
    The method assumes valid input parameters and does not perform explicit validation.
  parameters:
  - name: assignments
    description: An integer representing the current role assignments of players in
      a group or raid. Each bit or value may correspond to a specific role, such as
      tank, healer, or DPS.
  - name: players
    description: An integer indicating the total number of players involved in the
      composition being evaluated.
  - name: goal
    description: An OptimizationGoal enum value that defines what kind of composition
      is being optimized for, such as maximizing DPS, ensuring balanced roles, or
      prioritizing survivability.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated composition score. Higher scores
    typically indicate better alignment with the specified optimization goal. The
    exact scale and interpretation depend on internal implementation logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CalculateCompositionScore
    code: 'int assignments = 0b1101; // Example binary assignment

      int players = 4;

      OptimizationGoal goal = OptimizationGoal::MaximizeDPS;

      float score = roleOptimizer.CalculateCompositionScore(assignments, players,
      goal);

      std::cout << "Composition Score: " << score << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using different optimization goals
    code: "int assignments = 0b1010;\nint players = 4;\n\nfloat dpsScore = roleOptimizer.CalculateCompositionScore(assignments,\
      \ players, OptimizationGoal::MaximizeDPS);\nfloat survivalScore = roleOptimizer.CalculateCompositionScore(assignments,\
      \ players, OptimizationGoal::MaximizeSurvivability);\n\nif (dpsScore > survivalScore)\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Current composition favors DPS.\" << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Current composition favors survivability.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for optimizing group compositions
    in World of Warcraft raids or dungeons. The internal scoring algorithm may involve
    heuristics, weights assigned to different roles, and possibly dynamic adjustments
    based on encounter type or difficulty level.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'assignments' parameter accurately reflects player roles;
    incorrect bitmasks or role mappings will lead to inaccurate scores. The method
    does not validate inputs for performance reasons, so invalid values could cause
    unexpected behavior.
