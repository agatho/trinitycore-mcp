  class: PathfindingUtils
  method: GenerateFormationPositions
  signature: int PathfindingUtils::GenerateFormationPositions(const int & center,
    uint32 memberCount, float spacing)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a set of formation positions around a central point for a given
    number of members.
  description: The GenerateFormationPositions method calculates and returns a list
    of positions that form a structured formation around a specified center point.
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore for positioning NPCs
    or players in tactical formations, such as during group quests, boss encounters,
    or player-vs-player scenarios. The method takes into account the spacing between
    members to ensure they are properly distributed. It returns an integer representing
    the number of positions successfully generated, which can be used to determine
    if the operation was successful or to iterate through the resulting positions.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The reference point (GUID or position) around which the formation
      is centered. This typically represents the leader or main unit of the group.
  - name: memberCount
    description: The total number of positions to generate in the formation. Must
      be a positive integer.
  - name: spacing
    description: The distance between adjacent members in the formation. Should be
      a positive floating-point value representing the spacing in game units.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the number of positions successfully generated.
    A return value of zero or negative may indicate failure or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Generation
    code: int count = PathfindingUtils::GenerateFormationPositions(12345, 5, 2.0f);
      // Generates 5 positions around center 12345 with 2-unit spacing
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Formation Positions in a Group
    code: "uint32 memberCount = 4;\nfloat spacing = 1.5f;\nint result = PathfindingUtils::GenerateFormationPositions(playerGuid,\
      \ memberCount, spacing);\nif (result > 0) {\n    // Process generated positions\
      \ for group members\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with pathfinding systems to
    ensure that group members are positioned correctly for tactical gameplay. The
    actual positioning logic may vary depending on the formation type (e.g., circle,
    line, square). Ensure that the center point is valid and accessible before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Invalid parameters such as negative memberCount or zero/negative spacing
    can lead to undefined behavior or no positions being generated. Always validate
    inputs before calling the method.
