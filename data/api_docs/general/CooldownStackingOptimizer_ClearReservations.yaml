documentation:
  brief: Clears all active reservations from the cooldown stacking optimizer.
  description: The ClearReservations method removes all pending or active reservations
    within the CooldownStackingOptimizer instance. This function is typically used
    to reset the state of the optimizer, ensuring that no previous reservation data
    interferes with subsequent cooldown calculations or scheduling operations. It
    effectively resets the internal tracking mechanism for reserved cooldowns, allowing
    the system to start fresh with new reservations. The method does not take any
    parameters and has no return value.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      // ... some reservations are made ...

      optimizer.ClearReservations(); // Clears all reservations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully, as it will invalidate any existing
    reservations and may affect ongoing cooldown calculations. It is recommended to
    call this only when resetting the optimizer's state or before applying new reservation
    sets.
