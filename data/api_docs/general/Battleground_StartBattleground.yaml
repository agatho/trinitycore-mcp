documentation:
  brief: Initiates the battleground start sequence, initializing game objects and
    starting the match.
  description: The StartBattleground method is responsible for beginning a battleground
    match. It initializes all necessary game objects, sets up the battlefield environment,
    and starts the gameplay loop. This method is typically called internally by the
    battleground system when the required number of players have joined and the match
    conditions are met. The method prepares the battleground for active play by configuring
    player positions, spawning game objects, and starting relevant timers or events.
    It ensures that all players are properly positioned and that the battleground's
    core systems are activated.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic battleground start usage
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->StartBattleground();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the battleground is ready to begin,
    typically after all players have been properly queued and positioned. It's an
    internal method that's usually invoked automatically by the battleground manager
    system when preconditions are satisfied.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper setup may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. The method assumes that all necessary preparations have already
    been made by the battleground system.
