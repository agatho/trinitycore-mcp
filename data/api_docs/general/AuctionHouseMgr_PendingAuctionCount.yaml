documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of pending auctions associated with a specific player.
  description: The PendingAuctionCount method retrieves the number of auction items
    that are currently pending for a given player. This typically includes auctions
    that have been posted but not yet processed or completed, such as those awaiting
    confirmation or in the finalization phase. The method is useful for determining
    how many auctions a player has active or in progress, which can be important for
    managing inventory, preventing spam, and ensuring proper auction house behavior.
    It does not include completed or expired auctions in its count.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::size_t value representing the number of pending auctions associated
    with the specified player. Returns zero if the player has no pending auctions.
  examples:
  - title: Check Pending Auction Count for a Player
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nstd::size_t count\
      \ = sAuctionHouseMgr->PendingAuctionCount(player);\nif (count > 0) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Player has \" << count << \" pending auctions.\" << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"No pending auctions for this player.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through the internal auction list to filter and
    count those associated with the given player. It may be called frequently during
    player interactions with the auction house, so performance should be considered
    in high-traffic scenarios.
