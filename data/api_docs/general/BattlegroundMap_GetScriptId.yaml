  method: GetScriptId
  signature: uint32 BattlegroundMap::GetScriptId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the script identifier associated with the battleground map.
  description: The GetScriptId method returns a unique 32-bit identifier that corresponds
    to the script assigned to this battleground map. This ID is used internally by
    the TrinityCore framework to associate specific game logic, behaviors, or configurations
    with particular battleground instances. The returned value typically maps to entries
    in the game's script system, allowing for dynamic behavior customization based
    on the battleground type or instance. This method is commonly used during battleground
    initialization, event handling, or when determining which scripts should be executed
    for a given map.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the script identifier assigned to this battleground
    map. This ID uniquely identifies the script configuration associated with the
    battleground, enabling proper execution of game logic specific to that battleground
    type.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Script ID for Logging
    code: 'BattlegroundMap* bgMap = sObjectMgr->GetBattlegroundMap(1234);

      uint32 scriptId = bgMap->GetScriptId();

      TC_LOG_INFO("bg", "Battleground map %u has script ID: %u", bgMap->GetMapId(),
      scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Script Execution Based on ID
    code: "uint32 bgScriptId = bgMap->GetScriptId();\nif (bgScriptId == 1001) {\n\
      \    // Execute specific logic for Alterac Valley\n    bgMap->DoDelayedAction(DELAYED_ACTION_ALTARCV);\
      \ \n} else if (bgScriptId == 1002) {\n    // Execute specific logic for Warsong\
      \ Gulch\n    bgMap->DoDelayedAction(DELAYED_ACTION_WSG_CAPTURE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant function and does not modify the state of the BattlegroundMap
    object. The script ID returned is typically set during map initialization and
    remains static for the lifetime of the battleground instance. Developers should
    be aware that this ID directly relates to the scripting system and may require
    corresponding entries in the database or script definitions.
  warnings: Ensure that the returned script ID corresponds to a valid script definition
    in the game's configuration; otherwise, unexpected behavior or crashes may occur
    during battleground operations. Avoid modifying the script ID through external
    means as it can cause inconsistencies in battleground logic execution.
