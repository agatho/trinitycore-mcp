  class: TradeManager
  method: ValidateItemOwnership
  signature: bool TradeManager::ValidateItemOwnership(Item * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates that the player owns the specified item in their inventory
  description: The ValidateItemOwnership method checks whether the current player
    has valid ownership of a given item. This validation typically ensures that the
    item belongs to the player's inventory and hasn't been tampered with or is not
    being used in an invalid context such as during a trade. The method performs internal
    checks on the item's owner GUID, container location, and other integrity indicators
    to confirm legitimate possession.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is confirmed to be owned by the player and passes
    all validation checks; otherwise returns false if ownership cannot be verified
    or if the item is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Trade Validation
    code: "if (tradeManager.ValidateItemOwnership(item)) {\n    // Proceed with trade\
      \ logic\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"trade\", \"Item ownership validated for {}\", item->GetEntry());\n\
      } else {\n    // Cancel trade or notify user of invalid item\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      trade\", \"Failed to validate item ownership for {}\", item->GetEntry());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform expensive checks involving database lookups or container
    traversal depending on implementation. It should not be called frequently in performance-critical
    sections of code. The method assumes that the Item pointer is valid and not null.
  warnings: Do not use this method to validate items from external sources without
    prior sanitization, as it may lead to exploits if used improperly. Always ensure
    the item pointer is valid before calling this function.
