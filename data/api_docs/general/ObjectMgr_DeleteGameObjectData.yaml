documentation:
  brief: Removes game object data entry from the database and in-memory storage by
    spawn identifier
  description: The DeleteGameObjectData method removes a game object's data entry
    from both the database and the in-memory object manager structures. This function
    is typically used when a game object needs to be permanently deleted from the
    world, such as when it is destroyed, despawned, or when cleaning up obsolete entries.
    The method ensures that all references to the specified spawn ID are removed from
    internal caches and the database to prevent memory leaks and data inconsistencies.
    It operates on the spawn identifier which uniquely identifies a specific instance
    of a game object in the world.
  parameters:
  - name: spawnId
    description: The unique spawn identifier of the game object to be deleted. This
      value corresponds to the spawn ID used internally by TrinityCore's object management
      system to track game object instances in the world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete a specific game object by spawn ID
    code: ObjectMgr::instance()->DeleteGameObjectData(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Delete multiple game objects in a loop
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)\n{\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->DeleteGameObjectData(spawnIds[i]);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs both database cleanup and in-memory cache invalidation.
    It should only be called on valid spawn IDs that exist in the system to avoid
    undefined behavior. The operation is synchronous and may impact performance if
    called frequently with many entries.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent spawnId may lead to
    undefined behavior or data corruption. Ensure proper validation of the spawn ID
    before calling this function. This method does not perform any additional cleanup
    such as removing references from other systems - it only removes the object data
    itself.
