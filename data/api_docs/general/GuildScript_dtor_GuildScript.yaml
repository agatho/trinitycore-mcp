documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GuildScript instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The GuildScript destructor is automatically invoked when a GuildScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any resources allocated by the GuildScript instance, including memory
    deallocation and removal from internal tracking systems. In TrinityCore's scripting
    framework, GuildScript instances are typically managed by the core system and
    destroyed during server shutdown or when scripts are reloaded. The destructor
    does not perform any special game logic but ensures that the object is properly
    cleaned up to prevent memory leaks.

  - title: Automatic destruction of GuildScript
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    GuildScript* script = new GuildScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor is called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a virtual function in the base GuildScript class, allowing
    proper polymorphic destruction of derived script classes. Developers should not
    manually invoke this destructor unless explicitly managing object lifetime.
