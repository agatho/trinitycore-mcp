  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the shutdown process for the group coordinator, cleaning up resources
    and terminating active operations.
  description: The GroupCoordinator::Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully
    shutting down the group coordinator component. This method ensures that all ongoing
    group-related operations are properly terminated, resources are released, and
    any pending tasks are handled before the system transitions into a shutdown state.
    It typically involves notifying connected clients, saving persistent data, and
    cleaning up internal structures. The method should only be called when the server
    is preparing to shut down or when the group coordinator needs to be temporarily
    disabled. This operation is usually invoked during server maintenance, restarts,
    or when the group coordinator is no longer required.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator;

      coordinator->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server shutdown procedures and should
    not be invoked while group operations are actively in progress, as it may lead
    to inconsistent states. It's recommended to ensure all groups are disbanded or
    properly handled before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown() while active group operations are occurring may result
    in data loss or inconsistent group states. Ensure all group members are notified
    and handled appropriately before invoking this method.
