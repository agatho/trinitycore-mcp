documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one ActionFactory object to another, performing a
    deep copy of its internal state and actions.
  description: The operator= method implements the assignment operator for the ActionFactory
    class. It performs a deep copy of all internal data members from the source ActionFactory
    object to the target object, ensuring that both objects maintain independent copies
    of their action definitions and associated metadata. This is particularly important
    in TrinityCore's AI system where ActionFactory instances manage complex behavior
    trees and action sequences for NPCs. The method handles memory management properly
    to prevent resource leaks or double-free errors. When assigning an ActionFactory
    to another, all existing actions and their configurations within the target are
    replaced with those from the source.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source ActionFactory object whose contents will be copied to
      this instance
  returns: A reference to the current ActionFactory object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'ActionFactory factory1;

      ActionFactory factory2 = factory1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Later in code...

      factory2 = factory1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'ActionFactory factory1, factory2, factory3;

      // ... initialize factories with actions ...

      factory1 = factory2 = factory3; // Chained assignment

      // All three factories now contain the same action definitions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is essential for proper memory management in TrinityCore's AI
    system. Since ActionFactory objects may contain dynamically allocated resources
    like action lists or behavior trees, the assignment operator must ensure deep
    copying to prevent dangling pointers and memory corruption. The implementation
    likely handles reference counting or smart pointer management internally.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large ActionFactory objects as this operation
    may be computationally expensive due to deep copying of all internal action data
    structures. Avoid frequent assignments in performance-critical code paths where
    possible.
