  class: Player
  method: RemoveTalent
  signature: void Player::RemoveTalent(const TalentEntry * talent)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a talent from the player's talent tree.
  description: This method removes a specified talent from the player's talent tree,
    effectively unallocating it and making it available for reassignment. The talent
    must be valid and currently allocated to the player. This action is typically
    used when resetting talents or when changing talent configurations during gameplay.
    The method handles the necessary updates to the player's talent points and ensures
    proper synchronization with the client.
  parameters:
  - name: talent
    description: Pointer to the TalentEntry structure representing the talent to be
      removed. This must point to a valid talent that is currently allocated to the
      player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a specific talent
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      TalentEntry* talent = new TalentEntry;

      // ... populate talent structure ...

      player->RemoveTalent(talent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include updating the player's talent point allocation
    and ensuring proper synchronization with client updates. Performance considerations
    involve minimal overhead as this method typically only modifies internal data
    structures without complex calculations.
  warnings: This method should not be called on talents that are not allocated to
    the player, as it may cause undefined behavior or errors. Also, removing talents
    may affect the player's ability to reassign them if they have been previously
    removed from their talent tree.
