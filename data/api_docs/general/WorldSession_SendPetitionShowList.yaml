documentation:
  brief: Sends a petition list packet to the client for the specified player GUID.
  description: The SendPetitionShowList method is responsible for transmitting a list
    of available petitions to a connected World of Warcraft client. This function
    is typically invoked when a player interacts with a petition signer or when the
    client requests to view the current petition list. The method prepares and sends
    a packet containing information about all active petitions, including their names,
    creators, and status. It operates within the TrinityCore framework's session management
    system, ensuring that only authenticated players receive valid petition data.
    This functionality supports the game's guild and character petition systems, allowing
    players to sign or view various in-game requests.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose petition list should
      be sent. This parameter determines which set of petitions is transmitted to
      the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->SendPetitionShowList(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WorldSession class and relies on proper session
    state management. It assumes that the player has been authenticated and that the
    client is expecting petition data. The method does not validate the GUID directly
    but depends on the session's internal state to determine if the request should
    proceed.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an actual logged-in player,
    as sending petition data to invalid or non-existent players may cause client-side
    errors or unexpected behavior. This function should only be called from within
    a valid session context where network communication is established.
