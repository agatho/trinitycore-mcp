documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has all required reagents for a given recipe.
  description: The HasRequiredReagents method evaluates whether the player currently
    possesses all necessary reagents required to craft a specific recipe. This method
    is typically used in conjunction with crafting systems to validate if a player
    can proceed with creating an item. It checks against the player's inventory and
    any applicable currency or resource requirements defined by the recipe. The method
    does not modify the player's inventory state; it only performs a read-only check.
    This functionality is essential for preventing invalid crafting attempts and maintaining
    game balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all required reagents are present in the player's inventory
    or resources, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (economyManager.HasRequiredReagents(recipe)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ crafting\n    player.CraftItem(recipe);\n} else {\n    // Notify player they\
      \ lack required reagents\n    player.SendNotification(\"You do not have all\
      \ required reagents.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's inventory system and may consider
    item counts, quality levels, or special resource requirements. Performance-wise,
    it should be relatively lightweight as it only performs checks without modifying
    state.
