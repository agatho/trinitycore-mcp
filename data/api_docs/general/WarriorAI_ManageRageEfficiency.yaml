documentation:
  brief: Manages rage efficiency for the warrior AI by optimizing ability usage based
    on available rage and combat state.
  description: The ManageRageEfficiency method is responsible for controlling how
    a warrior AI allocates and utilizes rage during combat. It evaluates the current
    rage pool, available abilities, and combat conditions to determine optimal ability
    execution timing. This method ensures that the warrior AI makes efficient use
    of its rage resources, prioritizing high-value abilities when rage is sufficient
    and managing rage generation through appropriate ability selection. The method
    integrates with the broader WarriorAI framework to maintain balanced and effective
    combat performance.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n    \n    ManageRageEfficiency();\n    \n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the main UpdateAI loop and should
    be invoked regularly during combat. It relies on internal state tracking of rage,
    available abilities, and combat conditions. The implementation may vary between
    different warrior specs (Arms, Fury, Protection) as each has distinct rage management
    strategies.
  warnings: The method assumes that the AI has a valid target and is in combat state.
    Calling this method outside of combat or without proper initialization may lead
    to undefined behavior. It's important to ensure that rage-related calculations
    are consistent with the game's current mechanics and balance updates.
