  method: ProcessSyncQueue
  signature: void PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::ProcessSyncQueue()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the synchronization queue for player bot character data.
  description: The ProcessSyncQueue method handles the asynchronous processing of
    queued database operations for player bot characters. It iterates through pending
    synchronization tasks and applies them to the database, ensuring that changes
    to player bot data are properly persisted. This method is typically called during
    game loop updates or when specific synchronization events occur. The method manages
    concurrent access to the database and ensures thread safety during data operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    playerbotCharacterDBInterface->ProcessSyncQueue();\n\
      \    // ... continue game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to ensure timely
    database synchronization. It may block briefly while processing queue items, so
    frequent calls could impact performance. The method handles its own internal locking
    mechanisms for thread safety.
  warnings: Calling this method from multiple threads simultaneously without proper
    synchronization can lead to data corruption or race conditions. Ensure that no
    other database operations are in progress when calling this method.
