    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell has a specific channel interrupt flag.
  description: This method checks if a spell possesses a particular channel interrupt
    flag, which defines when a spell's channeling can be interrupted. It is used to
    evaluate the conditions under which a spell's channeling might be disrupted by
    various game mechanics such as damage, movement, or other interrupts. The method
    returns true if the specified flag is present in the spell's interrupt flags,
    otherwise false. This functionality is crucial for understanding how spells behave
    during channeling and what events can interrupt them.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell has the specified channel interrupt flag; otherwise
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Channel Interrupt Flag
    code: "if (spellInfo->HasChannelInterruptFlag(SpellAuraInterruptFlags2::SPELL_AURA_INTERRUPT_FLAG_DAMAGE))\
      \ {\n    // Handle interruptible spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellInfo class and relies on internal spell data
    structures. It should be used carefully when evaluating spell behavior during
    channeling, as it directly impacts how spells respond to interruptions.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with different spell interrupt flags,
    as incorrect usage may lead to misinterpretation of spell mechanics and potential
    game balance issues.
