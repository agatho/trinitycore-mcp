documentation:
  brief: Checks if the game object has a specific flag set.
  description: The HasFlag method determines whether a specified flag is set within
    the GameObject's flags. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft client-server
    communication to verify object states or properties. It typically checks against
    predefined flag values such as those related to game object type, state, or interaction.
    The method returns true if the flag is present and false otherwise, making it
    useful for conditional logic in scripts and event handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified flag is set within the GameObject's flags;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flag Check
    code: "if (gameobject->HasFlag(GAMEOBJECT_FLAG_UNK1)) {\n    // Do something\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObject's internal flag system and should be
    used carefully when checking flags that may change during runtime. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it simply performs bitwise operations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with flags that might be modified by
    external events or scripts, as it may lead to incorrect assumptions if not properly
    synchronized.
