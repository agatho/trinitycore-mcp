  class: EscortAI
  method: EscortAI
  signature: void EscortAI::EscortAI(int * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an EscortAI instance for a creature with provided data.
  description: The EscortAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a creature
    that is meant to escort NPCs or players. This method sets up internal state variables
    and prepares the creature for escort-related actions such as following waypoints,
    engaging enemies, and completing escort quests. It typically takes a pointer to
    an integer representing the creature's data ID or instance identifier, which is
    used to configure specific escort behaviors based on the creature type or quest
    context.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to an integer that identifies the creature instance or data.
      This value is used internally by EscortAI to determine specific behavior patterns
      for different types of escorted creatures.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic EscortAI Initialization
    code: "class MyEscortCreature : public Creature\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeEscort()\n\
      \    {\n        EscortAI* escort = new EscortAI(&m_creature->GetEntry());\n\
      \        // Further setup and AI activation\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during creature creation or when an
    escort quest begins. The 'creature' parameter should point to valid data that
    defines the creature's behavior in the escort context.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided integer pointer points to a valid creature entry
    or instance ID, as invalid values may lead to undefined behavior or failed escort
    initialization.
