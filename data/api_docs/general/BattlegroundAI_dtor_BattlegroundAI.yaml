documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BattlegroundAI instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BattlegroundAI class is responsible for cleaning
    up all dynamically allocated memory and resources that were used by the battleground
    AI system. This includes releasing any references to game objects, clearing internal
    data structures, and ensuring proper cleanup of the AI's state before the object
    is deallocated. The destructor is automatically called when a BattlegroundAI instance
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no memory leaks occur
    during the destruction of battleground AI components and maintains the integrity
    of the game's memory management system.

  returns: null

  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void CleanupBattleground()\n{\n    BattlegroundAI* bgAI = new BattlegroundAI();\n\
      \    // ... use bgAI ...\n    delete bgAI; // Destructor automatically called\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a virtual function in the base class, allowing proper polymorphic
    destruction of derived battleground AI classes. It should not be called directly
    unless explicitly needed for cleanup purposes.
