  method: EvaluatePriority
  signature: DefensivePriority DefensiveBehaviorManager::EvaluatePriority() const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the current defensive priority level for the behavior
    manager.
  description: The EvaluatePriority method determines the appropriate defensive priority
    level based on the current state of the AI-controlled unit. This method analyzes
    various factors such as health percentage, threat level, nearby enemies, and available
    defensive abilities to assign a priority value that guides the AI's defensive
    decision-making process. The returned DefensivePriority enum indicates whether
    the unit should focus on basic defense, medium defense, or aggressive defense
    strategies. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle to dynamically
    adjust the behavior based on changing battlefield conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a DefensivePriority enum value indicating the current defensive
    priority level. Possible values include LOW_PRIORITY, MEDIUM_PRIORITY, and HIGH_PRIORITY,
    which correspond to different defensive strategies and resource allocation decisions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void ExampleAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = me->GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        DefensivePriority priority = defensiveBehaviorManager.EvaluatePriority();\n\
      \        switch (priority)\n        {\n            case LOW_PRIORITY:\n    \
      \            // Execute basic defensive actions\n                break;\n  \
      \          case MEDIUM_PRIORITY:\n                // Activate medium defense\
      \ abilities\n                break;\n            case HIGH_PRIORITY:\n     \
      \           // Initiate aggressive defense or retreat\n                break;\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during AI updates, so performance
    considerations are important. The evaluation logic should avoid heavy computations
    that could impact frame rate. The method assumes the unit has a valid target and
    current state information available.
  warnings: The method may return unexpected values if the unit's state is not properly
    initialized or if the AI system hasn't been correctly set up with appropriate
    threat detection mechanisms. Ensure that the unit has a valid victim and health
    status before calling this method for reliable results.
