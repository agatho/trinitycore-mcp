  method: MovementInform
  signature: void SmartAI::MovementInform(uint32 MovementType, uint32 Data)
documentation:
  brief: Handles movement inform events in SmartAI, triggered when a creature's movement
    is completed or interrupted.
  description: 'The MovementInform method is a callback function within the SmartAI
    class that is invoked when a creature''s movement behavior completes or is interrupted.
    This method receives two parameters: MovementType, which indicates the type of
    movement that occurred (such as waypoint, random, or combat movement), and Data,
    which provides additional information related to the specific movement event.
    It is commonly used in AI scripts to trigger subsequent actions after movement
    completion, such as initiating combat, casting spells, or changing states. The
    method serves as an important integration point for customizing creature behavior
    based on movement events.'
  parameters:
  - name: MovementType
    description: The type of movement that was completed or interrupted. Valid values
      include waypoint movement (1), random movement (2), combat movement (3), and
      others depending on the AI implementation.
  - name: Data
    description: Additional data associated with the movement event. The meaning of
      this value depends on the MovementType; for example, it might represent a waypoint
      ID or a specific movement identifier.
  returns: null

    code: "void SmartAI::MovementInform(uint32 MovementType, uint32 Data)\n{\n   \

      \ reaching a specific point\n        DoAction(ACTION_POINT_REACHED);\n    }\n\

      \            SetCombatMovement(true);\n            break;\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is typically called from within the core movement system of TrinityCore
    when a creature finishes moving to a destination. Developers should ensure that
    any logic inside this function does not block or perform heavy computations, as
    it may affect AI responsiveness. The method is part of the SmartAI framework and
    is intended for use in custom AI scripts.
  warnings: Avoid performing operations that could cause infinite loops or recursive
    calls within MovementInform, as this can lead to stack overflow or unexpected
    behavior. Also, be cautious when using movement data directly without validating
    its range or meaning, as incorrect assumptions may result in undefined behavior.
