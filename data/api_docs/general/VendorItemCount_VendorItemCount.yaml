  class: VendorItemCount
  method: VendorItemCount
  signature: void VendorItemCount::VendorItemCount(uint32 _item, uint32 _count)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the count of a specific item in the vendor's inventory.
  description: The VendorItemCount method is used to configure or modify the quantity
    of a particular item that a vendor offers for sale. This method allows developers
    to dynamically adjust how many of a specific item are available for purchase by
    players. It is typically used within the context of custom vendor systems, quest
    rewards, or dynamic item spawning logic. The method operates on the vendor's internal
    item list and updates the item count without requiring a full vendor reset. This
    functionality is essential for creating flexible and responsive in-game trading
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: _item
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the item to modify in the vendor's
      inventory. This corresponds to the item's entry in the game database.
  - name: _count
    description: The new quantity of the specified item that should be available for
      purchase. A value of 0 removes the item from the vendor's inventory entirely.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Item Count to 10
    code: VendorItemCount(12345, 10);
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Item from Vendor
    code: VendorItemCount(67890, 0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the vendor's item list and may require synchronization
    with client-side updates if used in real-time scenarios. It is recommended to
    call this method before the vendor's inventory is displayed to players to avoid
    inconsistencies.
  warnings: Modifying vendor item counts during active trading sessions might cause
    client-side discrepancies. Ensure that all modifications are made before or during
    vendor initialization, not during active gameplay.
