  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: operator=
  signature: BotSpawnEventBus & BotSpawnEventBus::operator=(const BotSpawnEventBus
    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotSpawnEventBus object to another
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy of all member variables from
    the source BotSpawnEventBus object to the target object. This assignment operator
    ensures that both objects maintain independent copies of their data, preventing
    shared references that could lead to unexpected behavior or memory issues. In
    the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this method allows for proper duplication
    of event bus configurations and associated spawn data when transferring bot-related
    events between different instances or contexts.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotSpawnEventBus object to copy from. This parameter must
      be a valid, initialized object containing the data to be assigned to the current
      object.
  returns: A reference to the current BotSpawnEventBus object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus eventBus1;

      BotSpawnEventBus eventBus2 = eventBus1; // Uses operator=

      // eventBus2 now contains a copy of all data from eventBus1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus bus1, bus2, bus3;

      bus3 = bus2 = bus1; // Chained assignment using operator=

      // All three objects now contain copies of the data from bus1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This implementation likely handles deep copying of internal containers and
    dynamic memory allocations to ensure complete independence between copied objects.
    The method should be efficient and avoid unnecessary memory reallocations when
    possible.
  warnings: When using this operator, ensure that the source object is in a valid
    state before assignment to prevent undefined behavior. If the class contains pointers
    or references, make sure they are properly managed during copy operations.
