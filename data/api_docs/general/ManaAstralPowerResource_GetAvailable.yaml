documentation:
  brief: Returns the current available astral power amount for the resource.
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the current amount of astral power
    that is available for use by a player or game object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, astral power is a resource used primarily by certain classes like
    druids and warlocks for specific abilities. This method provides access to the
    current value of the astral power resource without modifying it. The returned
    value represents the actual usable amount of astral power at the time of the call,
    which may be affected by various game mechanics such as regeneration rates, consumable
    effects, or temporary buffs/debuffs.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current available amount of astral power.
    This value typically ranges from 0 to the maximum astral power capacity defined
    for the resource type, and may be zero if no astral power is currently available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 availablePower = player->GetResource(POWER_MANA)->GetAvailable();\n\
      if (availablePower >= 100)\n{\n    // Use astral power for an ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Resource Before Ability Usage
    code: "ManaAstralPowerResource* resource = dynamic_cast<ManaAstralPowerResource*>(player->GetResource(POWER_MANA));\n\
      if (resource && resource->GetAvailable() >= 50)\n{\n    // Cast ability that\
      \ costs 50 astral power\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ASTRAL_POWER_ABILITY,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resource management
    functions to determine if a player has sufficient astral power to cast a spell
    or use an ability. The value returned may change dynamically based on game events
    such as power regeneration, consumable usage, or external effects that modify
    the resource.
  warnings: Be aware that calling this method does not consume any astral power -
    it only retrieves the current value. If you intend to use astral power for an
    ability, ensure you properly deduct the required amount from the resource after
    checking availability.
