documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the QuestValidation class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the QuestValidation
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's quest system to access
    global quest validation functionality. The returned instance provides methods
    for validating quest-related data and ensuring quest states are consistent with
    game rules. This implementation typically uses a static local variable or similar
    thread-safe mechanism to guarantee single instantiation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton QuestValidation instance. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized on first access.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestValidation* validator = QuestValidation::instance();

      bool isValid = validator->ValidateQuest(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Validation Methods
    code: "QuestValidation* qv = QuestValidation::instance();\nif (qv->IsQuestValid(67890))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with quest handling\n    qv->ProcessQuestCompletion(67890);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the singleton pattern which means all calls to instance()
    will return the same object reference. The implementation should be thread-safe
    as TrinityCore runs in a multi-threaded environment. The QuestValidation singleton
    is typically initialized during server startup and remains valid for the entire
    application lifetime.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, avoid creating multiple instances manually
    or relying on global state for unit testing. The singleton instance should not
    be stored in a global variable outside of its intended scope to prevent memory
    leaks or unexpected behavior.
