  brief: Processes incoming addon chat messages from players
  description: Handles the opcode for addon chat messages sent by clients. This method
    processes chat messages that are prefixed with addon-specific data, typically
    used by third-party addons to communicate with the server. The method validates
    the message format and forwards it to appropriate handlers or broadcasts it to
    relevant players based on the message type and target. It ensures proper handling
    of addon-specific communication while maintaining security and preventing abuse.

  - title: Basic addon message processing
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleChatAddonMessageOpcode(WorldPackets::Chat::ChatAddonMessage&\
      \ chatAddonMessage)\n{\n    // Validate message format\n    if (chatAddonMessage.prefix.empty()\
      \ || chatAddonMessage.message.empty())\n        return;\n    \n    // Process\
      \ addon message\n    sWorld->SendGlobalChatMsg(chatAddonMessage.message);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core chat system and should be called from the
    main network processing loop. It's designed to handle addon-specific messages
    that follow a defined protocol. The method performs basic validation but relies
    on higher-level systems for security checks.
  warnings: Improper handling of addon messages can lead to security vulnerabilities
    or performance issues. Ensure proper validation and sanitization of message content
    before forwarding to other systems. This method should not be used directly for
    regular chat processing.
