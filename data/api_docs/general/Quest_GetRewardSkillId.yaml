  class: Quest
  method: GetRewardSkillId
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetRewardSkillId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the skill ID associated with the quest reward.
  description: The GetRewardSkillId method retrieves the specific skill ID that is
    granted as a reward when completing a quest. This method is commonly used in quest-related
    code to determine which skill the player will gain access to upon quest completion.
    The returned value represents the skill ID from the game's skill system, typically
    corresponding to a specific skill such as Mining, Enchanting, or other professions.
    This method is part of the Quest class and provides access to the reward-related
    data for quests that grant skills.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the skill ID associated with the quest reward, which corresponds
    to a specific skill in the game's skill system. The value is typically a uint32
    representing the skill ID, such as 164 (Mining), 185 (Enchanting), or other profession
    skills.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 skillId = quest->GetRewardSkillId();\nif (skillId > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Process the skill ID\n    // For example, if skillId == 164, it means the\
      \ player gains Mining skill\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest reward methods
    to determine what skill the player will gain upon completing a quest. It's important
    to note that this method returns 0 if no skill reward is associated with the quest,
    which can happen for quests that don't grant skills.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as some quests may not have any skill
    rewards, and in such cases, the returned value will be zero. This can lead to
    unexpected behavior if not properly handled in code.
