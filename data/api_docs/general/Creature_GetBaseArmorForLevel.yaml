  method: GetBaseArmorForLevel
  signature: float Creature::GetBaseArmorForLevel(uint8 level) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the base armor value for a creature at the specified
    level.
  description: This method computes the base armor value that a creature should possess
    at a given level, based on game mechanics and creature type. It is used internally
    by the TrinityCore engine to determine creature armor values during creature creation
    and level progression. The method takes into account the creature's level and
    its armor scaling factors, returning a float value representing the base armor.
    This function is essential for maintaining proper creature balance and ensuring
    accurate combat mechanics in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the base armor for the creature at the
    specified level. The value is typically between 0 and 10000, depending on the
    creature's level and type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float armor = creature->GetBaseArmorForLevel(80);

      // Returns the base armor for a level 80 creature'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during creature creation and level progression
    calculations. It may be called multiple times during a creature's lifetime, particularly
    when updating its stats based on level changes.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases; it's primarily
    used internally by the TrinityCore engine for creature stat calculation. Incorrect
    usage could lead to improper creature armor values and affect combat balance.
