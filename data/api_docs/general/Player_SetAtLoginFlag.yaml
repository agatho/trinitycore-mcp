  class: Player
  method: SetAtLoginFlag
  signature: void Player::SetAtLoginFlag(AtLoginFlags f)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the at login flag for a player, determining which actions will be performed
    at character login.
  description: The SetAtLoginFlag method allows developers to specify which actions
    should be executed when a player logs into the game. This method is commonly used
    in conjunction with other login-related flags to control character behavior upon
    login, such as setting the flag for resurrection, teleportation, or other special
    actions. The method modifies the internal AtLoginFlags member of the Player class,
    which determines the player's login behavior and can be combined with other flags
    to achieve desired effects.
  parameters:
  - name: f
    description: The AtLoginFlags value to set for the player. This parameter specifies
      which actions should be performed at login, such as resurrection, teleportation,
      or other special behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Resurrection Flag
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetAtLoginFlag(AT_LOGIN_RESURRECTION);

      // This will ensure the player is resurrected upon login'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Multiple Flags
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetAtLoginFlag(AT_LOGIN_RESURRECTION | AT_LOGIN_TELEPORT);

      // This sets both resurrection and teleportation flags'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other login flag methods
    like SetAtLoginFlag() and GetAtLoginFlags(). The implementation involves modifying
    the internal AtLoginFlags member of the Player class, which can be accessed through
    the GetAtLoginFlags() method. Performance considerations are minimal as this is
    a simple assignment operation.
  warnings: Be cautious when using multiple flags together, as some combinations may
    not be supported or could cause unexpected behavior. Ensure that the flags being
    set are valid and appropriate for the intended use case.
