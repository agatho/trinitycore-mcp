documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a GameObject meets its interaction conditions for player
    interaction.
  description: This method evaluates whether a GameObject's interaction conditions
    are met, allowing a player to interact with it. It checks various game mechanics
    such as quest requirements, item requirements, and player state conditions that
    must be satisfied for the GameObject to be interactable. The method returns true
    if all conditions are met, false otherwise, making it essential for determining
    valid interactions in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject meets all interaction conditions and can
    be interacted with by the player; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interaction Check
    code: "if (gameObject->MeetsInteractCondition(&player)) {\n    // Player can interact\
      \ with the GameObject\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject interaction
    methods to determine if a player can interact with a specific GameObject. It may
    involve checking quest states, item requirements, and player conditions.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by developers without understanding
    the underlying game mechanics; it's primarily used for internal game logic processing.
