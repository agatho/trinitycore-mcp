  method: CheckForProcs
  signature: void RetributionPaladinRefactored::CheckForProcs()
documentation:
  brief: Checks for and processes applicable procs for the Retribution Paladin class.
  description: The CheckForProcs method evaluates the current state of the Retribution
    Paladin to determine if any proc effects should be triggered. This includes checking
    for weapon enchantment procs, set bonuses, and other passive abilities that activate
    based on certain conditions such as melee attacks or spell casts. The method typically
    runs during combat events to ensure timely activation of these effects. It is
    part of the core gameplay loop for maintaining class-specific mechanics and ensuring
    proper buff/debuff application.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat event
    code: "void CombatEvent()\n{\n    // Triggered when player performs a melee attack\n\
      \    if (player->GetClass() == CLASS_PALADIN && player->GetSpec() == SPEC_RETRIBUTION)\n\
      \    {\n        RetributionPaladinRefactored* paladin = static_cast<RetributionPaladinRefactored*>(player);\n\
      \        paladin->CheckForProcs();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any action that might trigger a proc,
    such as melee attacks or spell casts. It is recommended to call this method during
    combat events rather than continuously to maintain performance. The implementation
    may involve checking internal cooldowns and state flags.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method can lead to incorrect proc triggering
    or missed effects. Ensure that the method is only called when appropriate for
    the class's gameplay mechanics to avoid unintended behavior.
