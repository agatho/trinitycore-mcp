documentation:
  brief: Clears the internal cache used by the position strategy to optimize pathfinding
    and positioning calculations.
  description: The CleanupCache method is responsible for clearing any cached data
    that the PositionStrategyBase class uses to improve performance during position
    calculations. This typically includes precomputed paths, spatial partitioning
    data, or other temporary structures that are used to speed up subsequent calls
    to positioning methods. The method ensures that stale or outdated cache entries
    do not interfere with current pathfinding operations, particularly important in
    dynamic environments where the game world changes frequently. It is usually invoked
    when significant environmental changes occur, such as terrain modifications, object
    spawns, or when switching between different navigation contexts.

  - title: Basic Cache Cleanup Usage
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase* strategy = new SomeDerivedPositionStrategy();

      // ... perform positioning operations ...

      strategy->CleanupCache(); // Clear cache after major world changes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as frequent cache clearing can negatively
    impact performance. It's typically invoked during major world state transitions
    rather than on every position update.
