  class: LFGMgr
  method: DecreaseKicksLeft
  signature: void LFGMgr::DecreaseKicksLeft(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Decreases the number of remaining kicks for a player in a LFG group.
  description: The DecreaseKicksLeft method reduces the kick counter for a specified
    player within a Looking For Group (LFG) instance. This mechanism is used to track
    how many times a player can be kicked from a group before being temporarily banned
    from joining LFG groups. Each time this method is called, it decrements the internal
    kick count associated with the given GUID. The method typically gets invoked when
    a player is removed from a group by another player or automatically by the system
    due to certain conditions such as AFK status or leaving the instance. It's part
    of the LFG system's anti-abuse measures to prevent players from repeatedly joining
    and leaving groups.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose kick count
      should be decreased. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the player's
      unique ID within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Decrease kick count for a specific player
    code: 'LFGMgr* lfgMgr = sLFGMgr;

      uint32 playerGuid = 123456;

      lfgMgr->DecreaseKicksLeft(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger LFG system that tracks player behavior
    to prevent abuse. It's important to note that the kick count may be reset under
    certain conditions, such as after a successful group completion or when a player
    rejoins a new group. The internal implementation might involve checking if the
    player has any remaining kicks before decrementing.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method is valid and corresponds to
    an actual player in the game world. Passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs could
    lead to undefined behavior or errors in the LFG system.
