documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ObjectiveTracker class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the ObjectiveTracker
    class, providing global access to a single tracker object that manages quest objectives
    and achievements for players. This method ensures that only one ObjectiveTracker
    instance exists throughout the game session, allowing consistent tracking of player
    progress across different systems and modules. The returned pointer is guaranteed
    to be valid during active gameplay sessions and should not be deleted by callers.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton ObjectiveTracker instance. Returns a valid pointer
    when called during normal gameplay operation; returns nullptr if invoked before
    the tracker has been initialized or after system shutdown.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ObjectiveTracker* tracker = ObjectiveTracker::instance();\nif (tracker)\n\
      {\n    // Use the tracker to manage objectives\n    tracker->AddObjective(...);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Quest Progress
    code: "ObjectiveTracker* tracker = ObjectiveTracker::instance();\nif (tracker\
      \ && player->GetQuestStatus(12345) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n{\n    tracker->UpdateObjective(12345,\
      \ 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any game thread. The singleton
    instance is created automatically on first access and destroyed at application
    shutdown. Developers should not attempt to create or destroy ObjectiveTracker
    instances directly.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the tracker itself,
    as it may become invalid during server shutdown or restart operations. Avoid calling
    this method from static initialization contexts where the singleton might not
    yet be available.
