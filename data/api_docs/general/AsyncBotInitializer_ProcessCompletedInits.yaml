  signature: size_t AsyncBotInitializer::ProcessCompletedInits(size_t maxToProcess)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a batch of completed asynchronous bot initializations and returns
    the number of items handled.
  description: The ProcessCompletedInits method is responsible for handling the completion
    of asynchronous initialization tasks for game bots. It processes up to a specified
    maximum number of completed initializations from an internal queue or list, updating
    their states and performing any necessary post-initialization logic. This method
    is typically called during the game loop or at specific intervals to ensure that
    bot initialization tasks are properly managed without blocking the main thread.
    The method ensures that asynchronous operations do not accumulate indefinitely
    and helps maintain performance by processing results in batches.
  parameters: []
  returns: The number of completed initializations that were successfully processed
    during this call. Returns zero if no initializations were available to process
    or if the maximum limit was reached.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop() {\n    AsyncBotInitializer* initializer = AsyncBotInitializer::Get();\n\
      \    size_t processed = initializer->ProcessCompletedInits(10);\n    // Handle\
      \ the number of bots initialized\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing all available initializations
    code: "size_t ProcessAll() {\n    AsyncBotInitializer* initializer = AsyncBotInitializer::Get();\n\
      \    size_t total = 0;\n    size_t batch;\n    do {\n        batch = initializer->ProcessCompletedInits(100);\n\
      \        total += batch;\n    } while (batch > 0);\n    return total;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be non-blocking and should be called frequently
    in the game loop to prevent accumulation of pending initializations. It's important
    to understand that this method may not process all available initializations if
    maxToProcess is limited, so it should typically be called repeatedly until no
    more items are returned.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very high maxToProcess value might cause performance
    hiccups if many bots complete initialization simultaneously. Ensure proper synchronization
    if this method is called from multiple threads.
