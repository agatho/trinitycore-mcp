  method: Create
  signature: MovementGenerator * RandomMovementFactory::Create(Unit * object) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new random movement generator for the specified unit.
  description: The Create method of RandomMovementFactory is responsible for instantiating
    a new MovementGenerator object that governs random movement behavior for a given
    Unit. This factory pattern implementation ensures that each call to Create produces
    a distinct movement generator tailored for the provided unit's random pathfinding
    requirements. The generated MovementGenerator will typically cause the unit to
    move in unpredictable directions within a defined radius, useful for creating
    natural-looking AI behavior such as wandering NPCs or roaming creatures. The method
    does not modify the input Unit directly but instead returns a pointer to a newly
    allocated MovementGenerator object that must be managed by the caller.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a newly created MovementGenerator object that controls random
    movement for the specified unit. Returns nullptr if the creation process fails
    or if invalid parameters are provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of RandomMovementFactory::Create
    code: "RandomMovementFactory factory;\nUnit* player = ...; // some valid Unit\
      \ pointer\nMovementGenerator* movementGen = factory.Create(player);\nif (movementGen\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the movement generator to set unit's movement\n\
      \    player->SetMovementGenerator(movementGen);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned MovementGenerator must be properly managed and eventually deleted
    by the caller or integrated into a system that handles its lifecycle. The factory
    does not retain ownership of the created object, so it's the responsibility of
    the calling code to ensure proper memory management.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed to Create is valid and not null; passing
    an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior. Also, be aware that MovementGenerator
    objects returned by this factory are typically designed for short-term use in
    AI pathfinding and should not be reused across different units without proper
    initialization.
