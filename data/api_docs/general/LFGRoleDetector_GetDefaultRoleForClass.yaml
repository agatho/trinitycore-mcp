  method: GetDefaultRoleForClass
  signature: uint8 LFGRoleDetector::GetDefaultRoleForClass(uint8 playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the default LFG role for a given player class.
  description: The GetDefaultRoleForClass method retrieves the default role that a
    player of a specific class should assume when joining a Looking For Group (LFG)
    instance. This method is used internally by TrinityCore's LFG system to assign
    appropriate roles based on class specialization and game mechanics. The returned
    value corresponds to predefined role constants such as TANK, HEALER, or DAMAGE.
    The method does not validate the input class; it is expected that valid class
    values (0-11) are passed in order to avoid undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: 'The class identifier of the player (0-11). Valid values correspond
      to the standard World of Warcraft class IDs: 0=Warrior, 1=Paladin, 2=Hunter,
      3= Rogue, 4=Priest, 5=Death Knight, 6=Shaman, 7=Mage, 8=Warlock, 9=Monk, 10=Druid,
      11=Demon Hunter.'
  returns: 'Returns a uint8 value representing the default LFG role for the specified
    class. Possible values are typically: 1 (TANK), 2 (HEALER), or 4 (DAMAGE). The
    exact mapping depends on internal TrinityCore implementation and may vary between
    patches.'
  examples:
  - title: Get Default Role for Warrior
    code: uint8 role = lfgRoleDetector->GetDefaultRoleForClass(0); // Returns default
      role for Warrior (typically TANK)
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine Default Role in LFG Context
    code: "void OnLFGJoin(Player* player)\n{\n    uint8 defaultRole = lfgRoleDetector->GetDefaultRoleForClass(player->getClass());\n\
      \    // Use defaultRole to set initial role assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and assumes a predefined mapping between
    classes and roles. The implementation may be subject to changes in different TrinityCore
    versions or custom configurations. It's recommended to use this method only when
    role assignment logic is required, not for direct player role modification.
  warnings: Passing invalid class IDs (outside of 0-11 range) can lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect role assignments. Ensure that the input class value is validated
    before calling this method in production code.
