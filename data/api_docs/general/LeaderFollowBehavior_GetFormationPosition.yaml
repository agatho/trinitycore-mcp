  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetFormationPosition
  signature: FollowFormationPosition LeaderFollowBehavior::GetFormationPosition(int
    role)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the formation position for a given role within the leader-follow
    behavior.
  description: The GetFormationPosition method calculates and returns the specific
    positional offset that a follower should maintain relative to the leader based
    on their assigned role in a group formation. This method is typically used in
    AI-driven group behaviors where multiple creatures or players need to maintain
    structured positioning while following a leader. The returned position represents
    a 3D coordinate offset from the leader's current location, which can be used to
    determine where a follower should move or stay within a formation. This functionality
    supports various tactical formations such as line, circle, or column arrangements
    depending on how roles are defined and interpreted by the behavior system.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: An integer identifier representing the follower's role in the formation.
      Valid values typically correspond to predefined roles like LEADER (0), FRONT
      (1), LEFT (2), RIGHT (3), BACK (4), etc., though exact values depend on implementation
      details of the specific behavior configuration.
  returns: A FollowFormationPosition struct containing the X, Y, and Z offset coordinates
    relative to the leader's position. The returned structure defines where a follower
    with the specified role should be positioned in the formation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'FollowFormationPosition pos = behavior.GetFormationPosition(1); // Get
      position for front follower

      float x = pos.x;

      float y = pos.y;

      float z = pos.z;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Formation Position in Movement
    code: 'FollowFormationPosition pos = behavior.GetFormationPosition(2); // Get
      left-side follower position

      WorldLocation targetPos = leader.GetPosition();

      targetPos.x += pos.x;

      targetPos.y += pos.y;

      targetPos.z += pos.z;

      unit->MoveTo(targetPos);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the behavior has been properly initialized with
    a valid formation configuration. The actual positioning logic may vary depending
    on whether the leader is moving, stationary, or changing direction. It's recommended
    to call this method after ensuring that the leader's current position and orientation
    are up-to-date for accurate relative positioning.
  warnings: This method should not be called without first verifying that the LeaderFollowBehavior
    instance has been properly initialized with a valid formation setup. Calling it
    on an uninitialized behavior may result in undefined behavior or incorrect positioning
    calculations.
