documentation:
  brief: Sends garrison blueprint and specialization data to the player's client
  description: This method is responsible for transmitting all available garrison
    blueprints and specialization information to the player's client. It ensures that
    the player's UI displays the correct buildable structures, their unlock status,
    and any applicable specializations that can be applied to garrison buildings.
    The method typically gets invoked when a player logs in or when their garrison
    data needs to be refreshed in the client interface. This functionality is integral
    to the garrison system mechanics in World of Warcraft, allowing players to manage
    and upgrade their garrisons effectively.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Garrison Initialization
    code: "void Player::OnGarrisonLogin()\n{\n    if (GetGarrison())\n    {\n    \
      \    GetGarrison()->SendBlueprintAndSpecializationData();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely sends a packet containing blueprint and specialization
    data to the player's client. It should only be called when the player has an active
    garrison and the client is ready to receive updates. The method may internally
    handle serialization of garrison data into network packets.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid garrison context or before the client
    is properly initialized can result in undefined behavior or client-side errors.
    Ensure that the player's garrison state is fully loaded before invoking this method.
