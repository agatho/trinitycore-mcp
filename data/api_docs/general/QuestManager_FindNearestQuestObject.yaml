  signature: GameObject * QuestManager::FindNearestQuestObject() const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the nearest GameObject associated with a quest in the current
    map.
  description: The FindNearestQuestObject method searches through all active quest
    objects within the current map's scope and returns a pointer to the GameObject
    that is closest to the calling object (typically a player). This method is commonly
    used during quest interaction to locate quest-related game objects such as chests,
    levers, or NPCs that are required for quest progression. The search considers
    only those GameObjects that are currently active and associated with active quests
    in the map. If no suitable quest objects are found, the method returns nullptr.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the GameObject that is nearest to the calling object and associated
    with an active quest. Returns nullptr if no such quest objects exist within the
    current map scope.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearest quest object
    code: "GameObject* questObj = player->GetQuestManager().FindNearestQuestObject();\n\
      if (questObj)\n{\n    // Interact with the found quest object\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->SendGossipMenu(1,\
      \ questObj->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial search within the current map's GameObject
    registry. It may have performance implications if called frequently in tight loops
    or on high-traffic maps with many quest objects. The method relies on internal
    quest object tracking and will only return objects that are properly registered
    with active quests.
  warnings: The returned GameObject pointer should always be checked for null before
    use to avoid dereferencing a nullptr. This method does not account for quest object
    visibility or distance limitations beyond the map's scope, so additional checks
    may be required for complex quest interactions.
