    calendarEvent, const CalendarInvite & invite, uint32 flags) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar event invite removal message to the invited player.
  description: The SendCalendarEventInviteRemove method is responsible for notifying
    a player that their invitation to a calendar event has been removed. This typically
    occurs when an event organizer revokes an invitation or when an event is deleted.
    The method sends a specific packet to the invited player's client, informing them
    of the removal and updating their local calendar UI accordingly. It uses the provided
    calendar event and invite data along with flags to determine the exact nature
    of the removal notification to send.
  parameters:
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: The calendar event from which the invite is being removed. This contains
      all relevant information about the event such as title, description, time, and
      organizer.
  - name: invite
    description: The specific calendar invite that is being removed. This includes
      details like the invited player's GUID, invite status, and other invite-specific
      metadata.
  - name: flags
    description: Additional flags that control how the removal notification is processed.
      These may include flags for different types of removal (e.g., manual removal
      vs. event deletion) or for specifying notification behavior.
  returns: null

    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      CalendarInvite invite;

      uint32 flags = CALENDAR_SEND_FLAG_INVITE_REMOVED;


      // Assume event and invite are properly initialized

      CalendarMgr::SendCalendarEventInviteRemove(event, invite, flags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore calendar system and relies on proper
    initialization of both CalendarEvent and CalendarInvite objects. The method assumes
    that the target player is connected and that appropriate permissions are checked
    before calling this function.
