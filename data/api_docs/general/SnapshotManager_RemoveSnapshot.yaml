  class: SnapshotManager
  method: RemoveSnapshot
  signature: void SnapshotManager::RemoveSnapshot(uint32 spellId, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a snapshot associated with the specified spell ID from the snapshot
    manager.
  description: The RemoveSnapshot method is responsible for deleting a previously
    stored snapshot entry that corresponds to a specific spell ID. This functionality
    is typically used in conjunction with spell effect handling, where snapshots are
    created to preserve state information at the time of spell application. The method
    takes a spell identifier and an optional target parameter to determine which snapshot
    should be removed. It's commonly employed in systems that manage temporary effects
    or need to clean up stored data after spell execution or cancellation.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which the snapshot needs to
      be removed. This value must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's
      database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target of the spell. This
      parameter may be used to further refine which specific snapshot should be removed
      when multiple snapshots exist for the same spell ID. Can be NULL if not needed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SnapshotManager* manager = ...;

      manager->RemoveSnapshot(12345, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: With Target Parameter
    code: 'SnapshotManager* manager = ...;

      int targetId = 42;

      manager->RemoveSnapshot(12345, &targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal snapshot storage structures and
    may involve thread synchronization if used in a multi-threaded environment. The
    target parameter allows for more granular removal of snapshots when multiple instances
    of the same spell exist for different targets.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId provided is valid and corresponds to an existing
    spell entry, otherwise behavior is undefined. Passing an invalid pointer for the
    target parameter could lead to memory corruption or unexpected results.
