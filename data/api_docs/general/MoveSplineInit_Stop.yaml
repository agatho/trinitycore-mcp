  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: Stop
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::Stop()
documentation:
  brief: Stops the current spline movement animation and resets the movement state.
  description: The Stop method terminates any ongoing spline-based movement for a
    unit, effectively halting its animation and clearing the movement path. This method
    is typically invoked when a unit needs to cease moving immediately, such as during
    combat, when changing states, or when a new movement command is issued. It ensures
    that the movement spline is properly reset and that subsequent movement commands
    can be processed without interference from previous animations. The method does
    not necessarily guarantee an immediate stop in all cases, as it depends on how
    the underlying movement system handles interruption.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Stopping a player's movement
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit(player);

      splineInit.MoveTo(position);

      splineInit.Launch();

      // Later, stop the movement

      splineInit.Stop();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MoveSplineInit class which handles spline-based
    movement in TrinityCore. It is commonly used in conjunction with other movement
    methods like MoveTo(), Launch(), and Update(). The internal state of the spline
    may be reset, but the exact behavior depends on how the movement system processes
    interruptions.
  warnings: Calling Stop() while a unit is in the middle of a complex movement sequence
    might lead to inconsistent visual behavior if not properly synchronized with the
    game loop. Ensure that this method is called from a context where it won't cause
    race conditions or unexpected state changes.
