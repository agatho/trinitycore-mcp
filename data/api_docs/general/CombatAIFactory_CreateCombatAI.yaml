    config)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new combat AI instance for a bot with specified configuration settings
  description: 'The CreateCombatAI method initializes and configures a new combat
    AI system for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This function
    allocates necessary resources, sets up combat behavior parameters based on the
    provided configuration, and integrates the AI into the game''s combat system.
    The method handles the creation of AI decision-making structures, behavior trees,
    or state machines that govern how the bot will engage in combat scenarios. It
    ensures proper initialization of all required combat-related systems including
    target selection, spell casting, movement patterns, and tactical decision making.
    Precondition: The input bot pointer must be valid and point to an initialized
    bot object. Postcondition: A functional combat AI system is created and attached
    to the specified bot.'
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot object that will be assigned the combat AI. Must
      point to a valid, initialized bot instance. The pointer should not be null.
  - name: config
    description: Configuration object containing settings that define the combat AI
      behavior. This includes parameters such as aggression levels, spell usage patterns,
      target selection criteria, and tactical preferences. The config must be properly
      initialized before calling this method.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while negative
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid parameters, insufficient
    memory, or failed initialization. Positive non-zero values might indicate specific
    status codes or warnings during the creation process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat AI Creation
    code: "CombatAIConfig config;\nconfig.aggression = 0.8f;\nconfig.spellDelay =\
      \ 1000;\nint result = factory->CreateCombatAI(&bot, config);\nif (result ==\
      \ 0) {\n    // AI successfully created\n    printf(\"Combat AI created successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to create Combat AI\
      \ with code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Combat AI with Custom Configuration
    code: "CombatAIConfig config;\nconfig.aggression = 0.95f;\nconfig.maxRange = 30.0f;\n\
      config.minRange = 5.0f;\nconfig.spellDelay = 1500;\nconfig.useHealing = true;\n\
      config.prioritizeTargets = TARGET_PRIORITY_HEALTH;\n\nBot* myBot = GetBotById(12345);\n\
      if (myBot) {\n    int result = factory->CreateCombatAI(&myBot, config);\n  \
      \  if (result == 0) {\n        // Bot now has advanced combat AI with custom\
      \ settings\n        printf(\"Advanced Combat AI created for bot ID: %d\\n\"\
      , myBot->GetGUID());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI framework and integrates with
    the existing combat system. The created AI will automatically handle combat decisions
    without requiring manual intervention. The configuration object should be carefully
    validated before passing to ensure proper behavior. Memory management for the
    AI components is handled internally by the factory, but developers should ensure
    that the bot object remains valid throughout the AI's lifetime.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null bot pointer will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. The configuration object must contain valid values; invalid
    parameters may lead to unstable AI behavior or failed initialization. This method
    should only be called once per bot instance, as creating multiple AIs for the
    same bot may cause conflicts or resource leaks.
