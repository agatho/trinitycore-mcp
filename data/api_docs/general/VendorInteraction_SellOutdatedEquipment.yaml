documentation:
  brief: Sells outdated equipment from a player's inventory to a vendor.
  description: The SellOutdatedEquipment method processes a player's inventory and
    sells any items that are no longer viable for their current level or role. This
    typically includes weapons, armor, or other gear that has been superseded by better
    alternatives available at the vendor. The method iterates through the player's
    inventory, identifies outdated items based on game rules (such as item level,
    quality, or class restrictions), and removes them from the player's possession
    while crediting the vendor's gold to the player. This functionality is commonly
    used in automated vendor interactions or during character progression events where
    outdated gear should be cleared automatically.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose inventory will be processed for
      outdated equipment.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor to whom the outdated items
      will be sold.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myPlayer = ...;

      uint32 vendorGuid = 12345;

      VendorInteraction::SellOutdatedEquipment(myPlayer, vendorGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "if (myPlayer && myPlayer->IsAlive()) {\n    uint32 vendorGuid = player->GetNPCFlags();\n\
      \    VendorInteraction::SellOutdatedEquipment(myPlayer, vendorGuid);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle invalid player or dead player case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player and vendor are in valid states for interaction.
    It does not perform checks for whether the vendor is actually a valid vendor NPC
    or if the player has sufficient gold to purchase new items. The method may modify
    the player's inventory directly without any confirmation prompts.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as it will cause undefined behavior if used on an invalid object.
    Also, be cautious when using this in automated scripts or event handlers, as it
    modifies player inventory without user interaction.
