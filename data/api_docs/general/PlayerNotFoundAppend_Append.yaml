  brief: Appends player not found data to a channel notification packet
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with information indicating that a specified player was not found. This
    method is typically used in channel-related operations where a player's presence
    needs to be confirmed or reported. The method modifies the provided packet in-place
    by adding relevant notification data without returning any value. It is part of
    the PlayerNotFoundAppend class which handles scenarios where a requested player
    cannot be located within the game world.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in channel operation
    code: 'PlayerNotFoundAppend notFoundHandler;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      notFoundHandler.Append(notifyPacket);

      // notifyPacket now contains player not found information'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a pre-existing ChannelNotify packet and modifies
    it in-place. The PlayerNotFoundAppend class likely maintains internal state about
    which player is being reported as not found, though this isn't visible in the
    method signature. Ensure that the packet object passed to this method is properly
    initialized before calling Append.
