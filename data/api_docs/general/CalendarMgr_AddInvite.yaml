  class: CalendarMgr
  method: AddInvite
  signature: void CalendarMgr::AddInvite(CalendarEvent * calendarEvent, CalendarInvite
    * invite, int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a calendar invite to a specified calendar event within the context of
    a database transaction.
  description: The AddInvite method is responsible for associating a calendar invite
    with a specific calendar event in the TrinityCore database. It takes a pointer
    to a CalendarEvent object and a CalendarInvite object, and optionally accepts
    a transaction identifier to ensure data consistency during database operations.
    This method is typically used when a player sends an invitation to another player
    for a calendar event, and it handles the storage of that invite information in
    the database. The method ensures that the invite is properly linked to the event
    and that any necessary database updates are performed within the provided transaction
    context.
  parameters:
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: Pointer to the CalendarEvent object that the invite will be associated
      with. This represents the event for which the invitation is being added.
  - name: invite
    description: Pointer to the CalendarInvite object containing the details of the
      invitation, such as the invited player's ID and invite status.
  - name: trans
    description: Integer representing the database transaction identifier. This ensures
      that the invite addition is performed within a consistent transaction context
      for data integrity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of AddInvite
    code: 'CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);

      CalendarInvite* invite = new CalendarInvite();

      invite->SetPlayerId(67890);

      invite->SetStatus(CALENDAR_INVITE_STATUS_PENDING);

      sCalendarMgr->AddInvite(event, invite, 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the calendar system in TrinityCore and relies on proper
    transaction handling to maintain data consistency. The CalendarEvent and CalendarInvite
    objects should be properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that both CalendarEvent and CalendarInvite pointers are valid and
    not null before invoking AddInvite, as passing invalid pointers may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
