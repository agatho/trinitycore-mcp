documentation:
  brief: Disables cell creation for the current cell instance
  description: The SetNoCreate method configures the Cell object to prevent automatic
    creation of its associated world cells during map loading or player movement.
    This is typically used in scenarios where a cell's data should not be dynamically
    generated, such as when working with pre-defined static zones or when implementing
    custom cell management logic. The method sets an internal flag that affects how
    the cell behaves when accessed by the game engine's core systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable automatic cell creation in a custom zone handler
    code: 'Cell* myCell = new Cell(x, y);

      myCell->SetNoCreate();

      // Subsequent access to this cell will not trigger automatic creation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in TrinityCore's map and cell management systems.
    It affects internal cell state flags but does not modify the actual world data.
    The effect is immediate and persists until explicitly changed.
