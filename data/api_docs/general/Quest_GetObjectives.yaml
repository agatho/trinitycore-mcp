documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of objectives for the quest.
  description: The GetObjectives method retrieves the count of objectives associated
    with a specific quest. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to determine how many quest items or actions are required to complete
    a given quest. The returned value represents the total number of objectives that
    must be fulfilled for the quest to be completed, which may include kills, collects,
    or other actions depending on the quest design.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of objectives required for the
    quest. This value corresponds to the count of quest objectives in the database
    and can be used to determine how many items or actions are needed to complete
    the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int objectiveCount = quest->GetObjectives();\nif (objectiveCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Process quest objectives\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    like GetQuestObjectiveCount() or GetQuestObjectiveType() to fully understand the
    quest's requirements. The return value is determined by the database entries and
    may vary based on the quest's configuration.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it does not validate whether the
    quest actually exists in the database; it simply returns the count of objectives
    defined for that quest. Incorrect usage could lead to invalid data being processed.
