  brief: Loads vendor item data from the creature database for trade systems.
  description: The LoadVendorsFromCreatureDatabase method initializes and populates
    vendor item lists by querying the database for creature vendors. It retrieves
    all items associated with creatures flagged as vendors, including their prices,
    quantities, and other trade-related attributes. This method is typically called
    during server startup or when reloading trade data to ensure that all vendor inventories
    are properly loaded into memory. The method does not require any parameters and
    performs its operations internally using the TrinityCore database system.

  notes: This method is usually invoked during server initialization or when reloading
    vendor data. It may cause performance overhead on large databases due to multiple
    database queries. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and functional.
