documentation:
  brief: Replaces all pet flags on the unit with the specified flags.
  description: This method replaces all existing pet flags on a Unit object with the
    provided UnitPetFlag values. It is used primarily in the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to manage pet behavior and status flags. The method ensures
    that any previously set pet flags are cleared and replaced with the new flags,
    which can affect how pets behave in combat or interact with their owners. This
    operation is typically performed during initialization or when updating pet states
    during gameplay.

  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may affect pet behavior in combat.
    It is generally intended for internal use within TrinityCore's core systems, particularly
    when managing pet states during initialization or updates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect pet behavior or status
    flags, potentially causing pets to behave unexpectedly in combat or fail to respond
    to owner commands.
