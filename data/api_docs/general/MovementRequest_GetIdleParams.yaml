  signature: const IdleMovementParams & MovementRequest::GetIdleParams() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the idle movement parameters associated with this movement request.
  description: The GetIdleParams method provides access to the IdleMovementParams
    structure that defines how an object should behave during idle movement states.
    This is commonly used in AI systems where creatures or NPCs need to perform specific
    idle animations, rotations, or positioning behaviors while not actively moving
    toward a destination. The returned reference allows direct access to the parameters
    without copying the data structure, making it efficient for frequent queries.
    The method assumes that the MovementRequest has been properly initialized with
    idle movement data; otherwise, accessing these parameters may lead to undefined
    behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the IdleMovementParams structure associated with
    this movement request. This reference provides read-only access to the idle movement
    configuration including animation settings, rotation behavior, and positioning
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing idle parameters for AI behavior
    code: "void ProcessIdleBehavior(MovementRequest& request)\n{\n    const IdleMovementParams&\
      \ params = request.GetIdleParams();\n    // Use params to determine how to handle\
      \ idle state\n    if (params.HasIdleAnimation())\n    {\n        // Play idle\
      \ animation\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking idle movement configuration before processing
    code: "bool ValidateIdleMovement(MovementRequest& request)\n{\n    const IdleMovementParams&\
      \ params = request.GetIdleParams();\n    return params.GetIdleDuration() > 0\
      \ && params.HasIdleAnimation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference is valid only as long as the MovementRequest object
    remains alive and unmodified. Since this is a const method, it does not alter
    any internal state of the MovementRequest. The method should be used carefully
    in multi-threaded contexts where concurrent modification of the MovementRequest
    might occur.
  warnings: Accessing idle parameters from an uninitialized or improperly constructed
    MovementRequest may result in undefined behavior. Always ensure that the movement
    request has been properly set up with idle movement data before calling this method.
