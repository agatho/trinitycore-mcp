  class: StoredLootContainer
  method: AddMoney
  signature: void StoredLootContainer::AddMoney(uint32 money, int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Adds monetary value to a stored loot container, updating its money field
    and transaction state.
  description: The AddMoney method is used to increment the monetary amount stored
    within a StoredLootContainer instance. This method is typically invoked when looting
    items from game objects or creatures that contain gold as part of their loot.
    The method updates the internal money counter of the container and optionally
    records the transaction in a database or log system, depending on the implementation
    details of the trans parameter. It ensures that the monetary value is correctly
    added to the existing amount in the container without requiring explicit retrieval
    of current money values.
  parameters:
  - name: money
    description: The amount of gold (in copper) to be added to the loot container.
      Valid values are non-negative integers representing the quantity of copper coins.
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier used for tracking or logging purposes. A negative
      value typically indicates no transaction, while positive values may represent
      a specific transaction ID for database updates or synchronization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'StoredLootContainer lootContainer;

      lootContainer.AddMoney(1500, 42); // Adds 1500 copper (15 silver) to the container
      with transaction ID 42'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Zero Money
    code: 'StoredLootContainer lootContainer;

      lootContainer.AddMoney(0, -1); // No money added, but transaction is logged
      with ID -1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to persist changes when a
    transaction ID is provided. It should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments
    where concurrent access to the same loot container may occur. The method does
    not validate whether the money amount exceeds game limits or constraints.
  warnings: Do not call this method with negative money values as it may lead to unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that transaction IDs are properly managed to avoid conflicts
    or data inconsistencies in database operations.
