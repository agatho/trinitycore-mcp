documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the game object is an infinite game object.
  description: The IsInfiniteGameObject method checks if a GameObjectTemplate represents
    an infinite game object, which typically means the object has no finite duration
    or limited use. Infinite game objects are usually persistent structures like permanent
    doors, walls, or environmental features that do not expire or deplete. This method
    is used internally by the TrinityCore server to handle special behaviors and interactions
    for such objects, particularly in relation to their visibility, interaction, and
    destruction mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the game object is infinite (i.e., it does not have a limited
    duration or use count), otherwise returns false. This indicates that the object
    will persist indefinitely unless explicitly destroyed by game logic.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GameObject is Infinite
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate && goTemplate->IsInfiniteGameObject()) {\n    // Handle infinite\
      \ game object logic\n    printf(\"This is an infinite game object\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal flags or data stored within the GameObjectTemplate
    structure to determine if the object should be treated as infinite. It's commonly
    used in conjunction with other GameObject behavior checks during interaction processing.
