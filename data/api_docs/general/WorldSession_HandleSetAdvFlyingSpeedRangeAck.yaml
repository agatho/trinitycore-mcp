  signature: void WorldSession::HandleSetAdvFlyingSpeedRangeAck(WorldPackets::Movement::MovementSpeedRangeAck
    & speedRangeAck)
documentation:
  brief: Processes acknowledgment of advanced flying speed range updates from the
    client.
  description: The HandleSetAdvFlyingSpeedRangeAck method is responsible for handling
    the client's acknowledgment of an advanced flying speed range update sent by the
    server. This method is typically invoked when a player's flying movement speed
    parameters are modified, and the client confirms receipt of these changes. It
    ensures synchronization between the server's movement state and the client's understanding
    of the player's flying capabilities. The method likely updates internal movement-related
    flags or caches to reflect the new speed range settings.
  parameters:
  - name: speedRangeAck
    description: A reference to a MovementSpeedRangeAck packet containing the acknowledgment
      data from the client, including updated speed range information for advanced
      flying mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSetAdvFlyingSpeedRangeAck(WorldPackets::Movement::MovementSpeedRangeAck&\
      \ speedRangeAck)\n{\n    // Process the acknowledgment of flying speed range\
      \ update\n    // Update internal movement state based on client confirmation\n\
      \    // No return value expected\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement handling system in TrinityCore and is
    typically called as a result of server-initiated flying speed modifications. It
    does not directly modify player state but rather acknowledges changes that have
    already been applied to the client.
