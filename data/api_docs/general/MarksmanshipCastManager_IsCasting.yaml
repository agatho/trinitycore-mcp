  method: IsCasting
  signature: bool MarksmanshipCastManager::IsCasting() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently casting a marksmanship spell.
  description: The IsCasting method determines whether the player character is in
    the middle of casting any marksmanship-related spell. This utility function is
    typically used within the MarksmanshipCastManager class to manage spell casting
    states and prevent invalid actions during casting periods. The method returns
    true if a casting process is active, and false otherwise. It's commonly employed
    in game logic to ensure proper timing of abilities, interrupts, or state transitions
    during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently casting a marksmanship spell; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (marksmanshipCastManager.IsCasting()) {\n    // Player is casting, prevent\
      \ other actions\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with normal gameplay logic"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void PlayerAI::Update() {\n    if (!marksmanshipCastManager.IsCasting())\
      \ {\n        // Allow new spell casting\n        CastMarksmanshipSpell();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Wait for current cast to complete\n        HandleInterruptedCast();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented using internal state tracking variables
    that monitor the casting status. It's important to note that this check does not
    account for channelled spells, only instantaneous or cast-time spells. The implementation
    may be optimized for performance by caching the result of the last known casting
    state.
  warnings: Ensure that the MarksmanshipCastManager instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized object could lead to
    undefined behavior. Also, be aware that this function only reflects the current
    casting state and does not prevent new casts from being initiated during a cast
    cycle.
