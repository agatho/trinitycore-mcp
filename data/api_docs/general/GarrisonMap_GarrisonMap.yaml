  class: GarrisonMap
  method: GarrisonMap
  signature: void GarrisonMap::GarrisonMap(int id, int param1, int instanceId, const
    int & owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GarrisonMap instance with specified parameters including map
    ID, parameter values, instance identifier, and owner.
  description: The GarrisonMap constructor initializes a new garrison map object with
    the provided parameters. This method sets up internal state for a garrison map
    within the World of Warcraft TrinityCore environment. The initialization includes
    assigning a unique map identifier (id), configuring additional parameters (param1),
    associating the map with a specific instance (instanceId), and linking it to an
    owner character. The constructor is typically called during the creation or loading
    of garrison data structures in the game world, ensuring that each garrison map
    maintains proper association with its parent instance and owner.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for the garrison map. This value determines which
      specific garrison map template or instance is being initialized.
  - name: param1
    description: Additional parameter used to configure the garrison map behavior
      or properties. The exact meaning depends on the map type and context.
  - name: instanceId
    description: Identifier for the game instance where this garrison map resides.
      Used to distinguish between different player instances or world zones.
  - name: owner
    description: Reference to the character ID (GUID) that owns this garrison map.
      This establishes ownership relationships within the garrison system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GarrisonMap Initialization
    code: GarrisonMap garrisonMap(1234, 5678, 9012, playerGuid);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Garrison Map for Player Instance
    code: 'uint32 mapId = 1500;

      uint32 paramValue = 100;

      uint32 instanceId = player->GetInstanceId();

      const uint64& ownerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      GarrisonMap garrisonMap(mapId, paramValue, instanceId, ownerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal garrison system implementation and
    should not be called directly by external modules unless implementing core garrison
    functionality. The parameters are validated internally to ensure they conform
    to expected ranges and types for garrison maps.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values may lead to undefined behavior or failed map
    initialization. Ensure that instanceId corresponds to a valid game instance before
    calling this constructor.
