  method: KitingPattern
  signature: void KitingPattern::KitingPattern()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new kiting pattern for AI movement behavior in the game environment.
  description: The KitingPattern constructor initializes a new instance of the KitingPattern
    class, setting up internal state variables and configuration parameters necessary
    for implementing kiting behavior in TrinityCore's AI system. This method is typically
    invoked when creating or resetting a kiting pattern for a creature or NPC that
    needs to perform kiting movement mechanics during combat. The initialization process
    includes setting default values for movement parameters, establishing base conditions
    for kiting logic, and preparing the object for subsequent configuration through
    other methods in the class.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new KitingPattern instance
    code: 'KitingPattern pattern;

      // The constructor is called automatically when declaring the object

      // This initializes all internal state for kiting behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically not called directly by developers but rather invoked
    through object construction. The class likely contains additional methods to configure
    specific kiting behaviors such as distance thresholds, movement speed, and target
    tracking parameters.
