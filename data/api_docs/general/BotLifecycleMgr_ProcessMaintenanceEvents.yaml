documentation:
  brief: Processes maintenance events for bot lifecycle management, handling periodic
    tasks such as cleanup and state updates.
  description: The ProcessMaintenanceEvents method is responsible for executing periodic
    maintenance operations within the BotLifecycleMgr class. This includes managing
    bot states, performing cleanup routines, and ensuring that bots are properly initialized
    or terminated based on their current lifecycle stage. The method typically runs
    at regular intervals to maintain system stability and prevent resource leaks.
    It handles tasks like updating bot statistics, checking for expired sessions,
    and triggering appropriate callbacks for lifecycle transitions. This method is
    crucial for maintaining the overall health and performance of the bot management
    system in TrinityCore.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLifecycleMgr* mgr = BotLifecycleMgr::instance();

      mgr->ProcessMaintenanceEvents();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n\
      \    sBotLifecycleMgr->ProcessMaintenanceEvents();\n    // ... other updates\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly as part of the game's main update
    loop to ensure proper bot lifecycle management. It is designed to be lightweight
    and non-blocking, but frequent calls may impact performance if not properly scheduled.
    The implementation likely uses internal timers or tick counters to determine when
    maintenance tasks should be executed.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper scheduling can cause
    performance degradation. Ensure that it's only invoked at appropriate intervals
    rather than on every game tick unless specifically required by the system design.
