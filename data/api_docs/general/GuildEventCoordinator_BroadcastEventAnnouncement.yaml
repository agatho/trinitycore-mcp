  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::BroadcastEventAnnouncement(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild event announcement to all online guild members
  description: The BroadcastEventAnnouncement method is responsible for distributing
    a notification about a specific guild event to all currently online members of
    the guild. This method typically handles the communication aspect of guild events,
    ensuring that players are informed about upcoming activities, changes, or notifications
    related to their guild. It's commonly used in conjunction with guild event management
    systems to maintain player engagement and coordination within the guild structure.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event to be announced. This ID
      corresponds to a specific event entry in the guild event database, determining
      what information is broadcast to players.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a Guild Event Announcement
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 eventId = 12345;

      coordinator.BroadcastEventAnnouncement(eventId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the existing guild communication infrastructure to
    send messages directly to online players. It may internally check if players are
    within the same zone or realm before sending announcements, and could potentially
    queue messages for offline players if they come back online later.
  warnings: Ensure that the eventId parameter corresponds to a valid guild event entry
    in the database; otherwise, the method might silently fail or send incorrect information.
    The method should only be called when the guild context is properly initialized.
