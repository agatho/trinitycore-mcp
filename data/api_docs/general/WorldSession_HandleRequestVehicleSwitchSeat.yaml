documentation:
  brief: Handles a client request to switch seats on a vehicle
  description: This method processes a packet sent by the client when a player attempts
    to switch seats while riding a vehicle. It validates the request and performs
    the seat change if valid. The method is part of the vehicle interaction system
    in TrinityCore, allowing players to move between available seats on vehicles such
    as mounts or transport vehicles. It ensures that only valid seat transitions are
    allowed based on vehicle configuration and player state.

  - title: Basic seat switch handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestVehicleSwitchSeat(WorldPackets::Vehicle::RequestVehicleSwitchSeat&\
      \ request)\n{\n    // Internal validation and seat switching logic\n    // This\
      \ method is called automatically when client sends seat switch packet\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the network handler when
    a vehicle seat switch packet is received. It assumes proper synchronization between
    client and server state, and does not perform explicit packet validation beyond
    basic structure checks.
