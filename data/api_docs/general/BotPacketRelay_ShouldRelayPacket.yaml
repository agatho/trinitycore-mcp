  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: ShouldRelayPacket
  signature: bool BotPacketRelay::ShouldRelayPacket(const WorldPacket * packet)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given WorldPacket should be relayed by the bot packet
    relay system.
  description: The ShouldRelayPacket method evaluates a received WorldPacket to decide
    if it should be processed and forwarded through the bot's packet relay mechanism.
    This decision is typically based on packet type, content, or specific game state
    conditions relevant to bot behavior. The method acts as a filter to ensure only
    appropriate packets are relayed, preventing unnecessary processing or potential
    exploits. It is commonly used in conjunction with bot AI logic to maintain synchronization
    between the bot and the game world while respecting network efficiency and security
    constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: A pointer to the WorldPacket object that needs to be evaluated for
      relay eligibility. The packet contains the raw network data and metadata required
      for decision making.
  returns: Returns true if the packet should be relayed; otherwise, returns false.
    A return value of false indicates the packet is either irrelevant, already handled,
    or deemed unsafe for relay.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI logic
    code: "if (botPacketRelay->ShouldRelayPacket(&incomingPacket)) {\n    // Relay\
      \ the packet to the game server\n    botPacketRelay->RelayPacket(&incomingPacket);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with packet handling loop
    code: "void BotAI::HandleIncomingPackets() {\n    while (WorldPacket* packet =\
      \ GetNextPacket()) {\n        if (botPacketRelay->ShouldRelayPacket(packet))\
      \ {\n            botPacketRelay->RelayPacket(packet);\n        } else {\n  \
      \          // Handle locally or discard\n            HandleLocalPacket(packet);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely performs checks such as packet opcode filtering, content
    validation, and state-based conditions. It is expected to be called frequently
    during packet processing, so performance considerations are important. This method
    may be thread-safe depending on implementation details of the BotPacketRelay class.
  warnings: Ensure that all packet types being relayed are properly validated to avoid
    security vulnerabilities or unintended behavior in bot operations. Incorrectly
    allowing certain packets might lead to desynchronization or exploit opportunities.
