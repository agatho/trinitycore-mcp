documentation:
  brief: Assigns all resources and state from one BotResourcePool instance to another
  description: The assignment operator for BotResourcePool performs a deep copy of
    all internal resource data and state from the source object to the target object.
    This method ensures that both the source and destination objects contain identical
    resource pools after execution. The operation is typically used when updating
    or replacing the contents of one bot's resource pool with another, such as during
    bot initialization, configuration changes, or resource redistribution scenarios
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotResourcePool object whose contents will be copied to
      this instance
  returns: A reference to the current BotResourcePool instance (this), allowing for
    chained assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotResourcePool pool1;

      BotResourcePool pool2;

      // ... populate pool1 with resources ...

      pool2 = pool1; // Assigns all resources from pool1 to pool2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotResourcePool pool1, pool2, pool3;

      // ... populate pools with resources ...

      pool3 = pool2 = pool1; // Chained assignment of resources'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy to ensure that resource references
    are properly managed and that modifications to one pool do not affect another.
    The implementation should handle potential memory management concerns for dynamically
    allocated resources within the bot's resource system.
  warnings: Care should be taken when assigning large resource pools, as this operation
    may involve significant memory copying and could impact performance during high-frequency
    updates in bot AI systems.
