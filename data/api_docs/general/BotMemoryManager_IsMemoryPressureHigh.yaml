  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: IsMemoryPressureHigh
  signature: bool BotMemoryManager::IsMemoryPressureHigh() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot memory usage has reached a high pressure threshold.
  description: The IsMemoryPressureHigh method evaluates the current memory consumption
    of the bot system and determines if it has exceeded a predefined high-pressure
    limit. This is used internally by the TrinityCore AI framework to manage bot resource
    allocation and prevent system instability due to excessive memory usage. The method
    typically returns true when memory pressure is high, indicating that the system
    should take mitigation actions such as cleaning up unused data or reducing bot
    activity levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current memory pressure is considered high, false otherwise.
    This boolean value indicates whether the bot memory manager has detected that
    system resources are critically low and require attention.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botMemoryManager.IsMemoryPressureHigh()) {\n    // Reduce bot activity\
      \ or clean up memory\n    botMemoryManager.CleanupUnusedData();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal memory tracking mechanisms
    and may involve checking against thresholds defined in configuration files. It's
    designed to be lightweight for frequent polling during AI decision-making cycles.
