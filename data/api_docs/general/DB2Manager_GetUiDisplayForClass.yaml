    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the UI display entry for a specified class from the DB2 database.
  description: The GetUiDisplayForClass method fetches the ChrClassUIDisplayEntry
    associated with a given unit class identifier. This entry contains data related
    to how class-specific UI elements should be displayed in the game interface, such
    as icons, colors, or other visual representations. The method performs a lookup
    within the internal DB2 cache and returns a pointer to the corresponding entry
    if found; otherwise, it returns nullptr. This functionality is essential for rendering
    class-specific UI components accurately in the World of Warcraft client.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a ChrClassUIDisplayEntry structure that contains UI-related
    data for the specified class. Returns nullptr if no matching entry exists for
    the given class ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve UI Display for Warrior Class
    code: "const ChrClassUIDisplayEntry* displayEntry = sDB2Manager->GetUiDisplayForClass(1);\
      \ // Class ID for Warrior\nif (displayEntry)\n{\n    // Use displayEntry to\
      \ access UI properties like icon path or color\n    printf(\"UI Icon Path: %s\\\
      n\", displayEntry->IconPath);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on pre-loaded DB2 data and assumes that the ChrClassUIDisplay.db2
    file has been properly initialized in memory. It's safe to call from any thread
    as long as the underlying DB2 manager is thread-safe.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid class ID may result in a null pointer
    being returned. Always check for nullptr before dereferencing the returned pointer
    to avoid runtime errors.
