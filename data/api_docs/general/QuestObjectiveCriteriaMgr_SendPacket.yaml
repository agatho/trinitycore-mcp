  method: SendPacket
  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::SendPacket(const int * data) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet containing quest objective criteria data to the client.
  description: The SendPacket method is responsible for transmitting quest objective
    criteria information from the server to the client. This method is typically invoked
    when quest progress needs to be updated or synchronized between the game server
    and player's client. The method takes an array of integers representing the criteria
    data and formats it into a packet that can be sent over the network. It is part
    of the QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr class which manages quest-related objective tracking
    and synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing quest objective criteria data.
      The array elements represent various progress values or flags for different
      quest objectives that need to be synchronized with the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendPacket
    code: 'int criteriaData[] = {1, 0, 5, 3};

      questObjectiveCriteriaMgr->SendPacket(criteriaData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely handles packet construction and network transmission internally.
    The data array should contain properly formatted values that match the expected
    client protocol for quest objective criteria updates.
