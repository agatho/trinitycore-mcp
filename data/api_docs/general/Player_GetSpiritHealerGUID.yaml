documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the spirit healer that last resurrected the player
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the spirit healer
    that was responsible for the most recent resurrection of the player. The spirit
    healer is typically a NPC or player who performed the resurrection, and this GUID
    can be used to identify the specific entity that caused the resurrection. This
    method is particularly useful in scenarios involving player-versus-player combat
    where players may be resurrected by other players or NPCs, or when tracking the
    source of resurrection effects for game mechanics purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the GUID of the spirit healer who last resurrected the player,
    or 0 if no such healer exists. The value represents a unique identifier that can
    be used to identify the entity responsible for the resurrection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nuint64 guid = player->GetSpiritHealerGUID();\n\
      if (guid != 0)\n{\n    // Player was resurrected by a specific entity\n    //\
      \ Do something with the GUID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player hasn't been resurrected\
      \ recently\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with resurrection-related game
    mechanics. It may return 0 if no spirit healer has ever been involved in the player's
    last resurrection, or if the player has never been resurrected.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only returns the GUID of the most recent spirit
    healer who performed a resurrection; it does not track all resurrections or provide
    information about the full history of resurrection events.
