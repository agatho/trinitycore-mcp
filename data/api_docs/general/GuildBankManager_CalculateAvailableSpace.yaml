api:
  class: GuildBankManager
  method: CalculateAvailableSpace
  signature: uint32 GuildBankManager::CalculateAvailableSpace(int * guild, uint32
    tabId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the available space in a guild bank tab for storing items.
  description: The CalculateAvailableSpace method determines how many additional items
    can be stored in a specified guild bank tab. This calculation takes into account
    the current number of items already stored in the tab, the maximum capacity allowed
    for that tab, and any restrictions imposed by the guild's bank configuration or
    item types. The method is typically used to validate whether an item can be deposited
    into a specific tab before performing the actual deposit operation. It ensures
    that guild members do not exceed their tab's storage limits when managing guild
    resources.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier. This parameter
      specifies which guild's bank tab is being queried for available space.
  - name: tabId
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer representing the index of the guild bank
      tab. This identifies the specific tab within the guild's bank where space availability
      is calculated.
  returns: Returns a 32-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of additional items
    that can be placed in the specified guild bank tab. A return value of zero means
    no more items can be added to the tab.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Space Before Deposit
    code: "uint32 availableSpace = guildBankManager->CalculateAvailableSpace(&guildId,\
      \ 0);\nif (availableSpace > 0) {\n    // Proceed with item deposit\n    guildBankManager->DepositItem(guildId,\
      \ 0, itemGuid);\n} else {\n    // Notify player that tab is full\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Guild bank tab is full.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild bank data structures to
    retrieve current item counts and compare them against configured limits. It may
    also consider item stacking rules and tab-specific restrictions such as allowed
    item types or quality thresholds.
  warnings: Ensure the provided guild identifier and tab index are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid inputs could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
    The returned value should be checked before attempting any deposit operations
    to prevent overflows.
