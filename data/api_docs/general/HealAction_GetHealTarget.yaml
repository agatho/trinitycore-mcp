documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the target unit suitable for performing a healing
    action within the bot's AI context.
  description: The GetHealTarget method is responsible for identifying and returning
    the most appropriate Unit target for a healing action in the context of a BotAI.
    This method evaluates various factors such as health status, proximity, and threat
    level to select an optimal healing target. It typically operates within the framework
    of TrinityCore's AI system where bots make decisions based on game state and player
    behavior. The returned Unit pointer may be null if no suitable target is found
    or if the AI context does not support healing actions at that moment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a Unit object representing the target for healing, or nullptr
    if no valid target exists or the AI cannot determine one.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in HealAction Context
    code: "class MyHealAction : public HealAction {\npublic:\n    void Execute(BotAI*\
      \ ai) override {\n        Unit* target = GetHealTarget(ai);\n        if (target\
      \ && target->IsAlive()) {\n            // Perform healing logic\n          \
      \  ai->DoSpellCast(target, SPELL_HEAL);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the BotAI's internal state and targeting logic. It
    may perform checks for unit validity, health thresholds, and line-of-sight conditions
    before returning a target. Developers should ensure that the AI context is properly
    initialized before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling GetHealTarget without a valid BotAI context or when the AI system
    is not fully initialized may lead to undefined behavior or null pointer dereferences.
    Always validate the returned Unit pointer before using it in actions.
