documentation:
  brief: Returns the current state of the game object, including its activation status
    and interaction flags.
  description: The GetGoState method retrieves the current state of a GameObject instance,
    which represents the object's activation status and interaction flags within the
    game world. This method is commonly used to determine whether a game object is
    active, inactive, or has been interacted with by players. The returned value corresponds
    to the object's state as defined by the game mechanics, typically indicating whether
    the object is in a usable, locked, or disabled state. This information is crucial
    for determining how the object behaves during interactions and what actions can
    be taken.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the current state of the GameObject. The
    value typically corresponds to one of several predefined states such as 0 (inactive),
    1 (active), or 2 (locked), depending on the game object's configuration and interaction
    status. A return value of 0 indicates that the object is not active, while values
    greater than 0 suggest that the object has been activated or interacted with.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int state = gameObject->GetGoState();\nif (state == 1)\n{\n    // Object\
      \ is active and can be interacted with\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and should not cause performance issues when called
    frequently. The returned state value is typically used in conjunction with other
    GameObject methods to determine interaction behavior, such as whether an object
    can be activated or if it's currently locked.
  warnings: Care must be taken when interpreting the returned state values, as different
    game object types may have varying interpretations of these states. Some objects
    may return different values based on their specific configuration or the player's
    interaction with them.
