  class: RestorationHoTTracker
  method: ApplyLifebloom
  signature: void RestorationHoTTracker::ApplyLifebloom(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a Lifebloom heal-over-time effect to the specified target with the
    given duration.
  description: The ApplyLifebloom method initiates a heal-over-time (HoT) effect known
    as Lifebloom on a target identified by their GUID. This effect applies periodic
    healing to the target over a specified duration, typically used in Druid restoration
    gameplay. The method updates internal tracking structures to manage the HoT's
    lifecycle and ensure proper healing application at intervals. It is designed to
    integrate with TrinityCore's spell system and aura management framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit that will receive
      the Lifebloom effect. Must be a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  - name: duration
    description: The total duration in milliseconds for which the Lifebloom HoT effect
      will remain active on the target. Should be a positive integer value representing
      time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ApplyLifebloom
    code: 'RestorationHoTTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyLifebloom(12345, 15000); // Applies Lifebloom to target with GUID
      12345 for 15 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Lifebloom with Dynamic Duration
    code: 'uint32 duration = 10000 + (GetSpellLevel() * 2000); // Base duration plus
      level-based extension

      tracker.ApplyLifebloom(playerGuid, duration); // Applies Lifebloom with calculated
      duration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target exists and is valid within the current
    world context. The actual healing application occurs through internal event scheduling
    or aura tick mechanisms, not directly within this method call.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an existing unit; otherwise,
    the behavior may result in undefined state or errors. Duration values should be
    validated to prevent excessive or negative durations that could cause system instability.
