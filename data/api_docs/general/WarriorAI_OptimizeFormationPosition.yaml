  method: OptimizeFormationPosition
  signature: void WarriorAI::OptimizeFormationPosition()
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the warrior's position within a formation to optimize combat effectiveness.
  description: The OptimizeFormationPosition method is responsible for calculating
    and applying the most effective positioning strategy for a warrior AI unit within
    a group or formation. This method evaluates surrounding units, threat levels,
    and combat requirements to determine an optimal placement that maximizes damage
    output, survivability, or support capabilities depending on the warrior's role.
    It typically adjusts the warrior's movement behavior to maintain proper spacing,
    line of sight, and positioning relative to allies and enemies. The method is called
    during AI update cycles and may be triggered by specific combat events or formation
    changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    OptimizeFormationPosition();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with combat state check
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        OptimizeFormationPosition();\n    }\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the AI update cycle and may have
    performance implications if called too frequently. The optimization algorithm
    considers factors such as distance to target, proximity to allies, threat distribution,
    and available combat space. Implementation details are internal to the TrinityCore
    AI framework and may vary based on the specific warrior class specialization.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly from outside the AI update context
    without proper state validation. Improper usage could lead to unexpected movement
    behavior or positioning conflicts within the formation.
