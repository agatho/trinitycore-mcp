  method: InitializePaladinBaseline
  signature: void BaselineRotationManager::InitializePaladinBaseline()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the baseline rotation manager for paladin classes with default
    spell priorities and combat behavior settings.
  description: The InitializePaladinBaseline method sets up the internal state of
    the BaselineRotationManager specifically for paladin characters. This includes
    configuring default spell priority lists, establishing baseline combat behaviors
    such as holy power management, aura tracking, and cooldown handling tailored for
    paladin gameplay mechanics. The method ensures that all necessary data structures
    are properly initialized before any rotation decisions are made during combat.
    It typically runs once at the start of a paladin's encounter or when transitioning
    into a new combat scenario.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializePaladinBaseline();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any combat-related rotation decisions
    are made. It assumes that the player character is already initialized and has
    valid paladin class data. The initialization process may involve loading predefined
    spell lists from configuration files or hardcoded defaults.
