  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: QueryNearbyGameObjects
  signature: int DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::QueryNearbyGameObjects(const int & pos,
    float radius) const
documentation:
  brief: Queries and returns the count of nearby game objects within a specified radius
    from a given position.
  description: The QueryNearbyGameObjects method performs a spatial query to find
    all game objects located within a defined radius around a specified position.
    It utilizes a double-buffered spatial grid data structure for efficient spatial
    indexing and retrieval. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server to optimize object discovery and interaction within a player's vicinity.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is typically called during gameplay
    events such as player movement, object interaction, or area-of-effect spell casting.
    It returns the number of game objects found, which can be zero if no objects are
    within range.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of game objects found within the specified
    radius from the given position. Returns zero if no objects are found or if the
    input parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int count = grid.QueryNearbyGameObjects(100, 5.0f); // Find game objects
      within 5.0 units of position 100
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal double-buffered spatial grid structure
    for performance optimization. The 'pos' parameter is expected to be a valid grid
    cell index or coordinate identifier, and the radius should be a positive floating-point
    value. The method assumes that the grid has been properly initialized and populated
    with game object data.
  warnings: Ensure that the position parameter corresponds to a valid spatial grid
    location; invalid positions may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    This method does not perform bounds checking on the radius, so negative values
    may produce unexpected outcomes.
