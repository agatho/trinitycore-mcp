  class: BalanceDoTTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void BalanceDoTTracker::Update()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the balance DoT tracker state, processing active damage-over-time
    effects and managing their lifecycle.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining the state of damage-over-time
    (DoT) effects within the Balance class. It iterates through all active DoTs, applies
    damage calculations based on current game mechanics, updates tick timers, and
    removes expired effects from the tracker. This method ensures that DoT effects
    behave correctly according to World of Warcraft's combat system, including proper
    stacking, duration management, and interaction with other spell effects. The method
    is typically called during the creature or player's update cycle to maintain real-time
    effect states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void Creature::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    _balanceDotTracker.Update();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat System
    code: "void Player::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    Unit::Update(diff);\n    if (HasAuraType(SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_DAMAGE))\n\
      \    {\n        _balanceDotTracker.Update();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the update cycle to ensure
    accurate DoT tracking. The implementation may involve multiple internal state
    checks and can potentially trigger additional events or callbacks when DoTs expire
    or tick. Performance is generally low as it only processes active effects, but
    frequent calls may impact frame rate in high-density scenarios.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from within spell cast logic without
    proper synchronization, as it may modify the aura list during iteration. Ensure
    that all related DoT effects are properly initialized before calling Update to
    avoid undefined behavior.
