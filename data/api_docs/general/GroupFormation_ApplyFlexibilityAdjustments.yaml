  method: ApplyFlexibilityAdjustments
  signature: void GroupFormation::ApplyFlexibilityAdjustments()
documentation:
  brief: Applies flexibility adjustments to group formation based on player attributes
    and raid composition.
  description: The ApplyFlexibilityAdjustments method modifies group formation parameters
    dynamically to optimize player positioning and performance within a raid or group
    setting. This method typically adjusts spacing, role distribution, and movement
    patterns based on individual player stats, class types, and current group dynamics.
    It ensures that groups maintain optimal configurations for combat effectiveness
    while respecting player capabilities and limitations. The adjustments are applied
    in real-time during group formation or reconfiguration events.

  - title: Basic Usage in Group Formation
    code: 'GroupFormation formation;

      formation.ApplyFlexibilityAdjustments();

      // Adjusts group positioning based on current player attributes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group creation or when players join/leave
    a group. It may impact performance if called too frequently without proper throttling.
    The adjustments are calculated using internal player data and group configuration
    parameters.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate group formation contexts may
    produce unexpected positioning behavior. Ensure that all players in the group
    have valid attributes before invoking this method.
