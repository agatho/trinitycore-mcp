  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: IsRoleCompatible
  signature: bool RoleBasedCombatPositioning::IsRoleCompatible(ThreatRole role, CombatPositionStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given threat role is compatible with a specified combat
    positioning strategy.
  description: The IsRoleCompatible method evaluates if a particular ThreatRole can
    be effectively utilized within a defined CombatPositionStrategy. This functionality
    is crucial for determining appropriate AI behavior and positioning decisions in
    World of Warcraft's combat system, particularly when managing player roles such
    as tank, healer, or damage dealer. The method considers the strategic requirements
    of each combat position and matches them against the capabilities and responsibilities
    associated with different threat roles. It ensures that role-based positioning
    logic aligns with game mechanics and tactical positioning needs during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: The ThreatRole to evaluate for compatibility. This parameter specifies
      the player's or NPC's combat role (e.g., tank, healer, DPS) which determines
      their strategic positioning requirements.
  - name: strategy
    description: The CombatPositionStrategy to check against. This defines the tactical
      positioning approach that the method evaluates for compatibility with the specified
      threat role.
  returns: Returns true if the specified ThreatRole is compatible with the given CombatPositionStrategy,
    otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates that the role can effectively
    utilize or benefit from the strategy's positioning requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role-Strategy Compatibility Check
    code: "if (combatPositioning.IsRoleCompatible(ThreatRole::TANK, CombatPositionStrategy::FRONT_LINE))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with tank positioning strategy\n    printf(\"Tank role is\
      \ compatible with front line strategy\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Role-Strategy Combinations
    code: "ThreatRole roles[] = { ThreatRole::TANK, ThreatRole::HEALER, ThreatRole::DPS\
      \ };\nCombatPositionStrategy strategies[] = { CombatPositionStrategy::FRONT_LINE,\
      \ CombatPositionStrategy::BACK_LINE };\n\nfor (auto role : roles) {\n    for\
      \ (auto strategy : strategies) {\n        if (combatPositioning.IsRoleCompatible(role,\
      \ strategy)) {\n            printf(\"Role %d is compatible with strategy %d\\\
      n\", static_cast<int>(role), static_cast<int>(strategy));\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal logic to match role capabilities with
    strategic positioning requirements. It may consider factors such as movement speed,
    threat generation abilities, and positioning constraints specific to each role
    type. The implementation might cache compatibility results for performance optimization
    in frequently called scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the ThreatRole and CombatPositionStrategy enums are properly
    defined and consistent with the game's internal systems. Incorrect enum values
    could lead to unexpected compatibility results or runtime errors.
