  signature: Player * GroupEventHandler::GetBotPlayer() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bot player associated with the group event handler.
  description: The GetBotPlayer method returns a pointer to the Player object that
    represents the bot player within the context of a group event. This method is
    typically used in TrinityCore's AI and bot system to access the specific bot instance
    that is handling group-related events. The returned player object can be used
    to interact with the bot's state, properties, or perform actions on behalf of
    the bot. It is important to note that this method may return a null pointer if
    no bot player is currently associated with the group event handler.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot player, or nullptr
    if no bot player is associated with the group event handler.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = groupEventHandler->GetBotPlayer();\nif (bot != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the bot player object\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot player GUID:\
      \ %u\", bot->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Usage with Null Check
    code: "GroupEventHandler* handler = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nPlayer*\
      \ bot = handler->GetBotPlayer();\nif (bot && bot->IsInWorld())\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ operations on the bot player\n    bot->Say(\"Hello, World!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"No valid bot player found.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the group event handling system in TrinityCore and
    is primarily used for AI-driven bots. The returned Player pointer should not be
    deleted or modified directly as it's managed by the core system. Ensure proper
    null checking before using the returned pointer to avoid runtime errors.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned Player pointer is valid without checking
    for nullptr. Using an invalid pointer can lead to segmentation faults or undefined
    behavior. Also, be aware that the bot player might not always be in a valid state
    (e.g., not in world) even when the pointer is non-null.
