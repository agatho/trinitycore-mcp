  class: KitingUtils
  method: IsPositionTrappable
  signature: bool KitingUtils::IsPositionTrappable(const int & pos, const int & threats)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is trappable based on threat levels and
    positioning.
  description: The IsPositionTrappable method evaluates if a specific position in
    the game world is considered 'trappable' for a unit, typically used in AI pathfinding
    or combat logic. It takes into account the position of the unit and the threat
    level from surrounding enemies to determine if the unit can be trapped or cornered.
    This method is essential for kiting mechanics and positioning strategies in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position coordinate (likely x, y, z) of the unit being evaluated
      for trappability.
  - name: threats
    description: The threat level or number of enemies threatening the unit at the
      given position.
  returns: Returns true if the position is considered trappable (e.g., surrounded
    by sufficient threats), otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player's position is trappable
    code: bool isTrappable = KitingUtils::IsPositionTrappable(playerPosition, threatCount);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within an AI decision loop for kiting behavior
    code: "if (KitingUtils::IsPositionTrappable(currentPos, enemyThreatLevel)) {\n\
      \    // Attempt to move away from current position\n    MoveToSafeLocation();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other kiting utilities to
    determine optimal movement patterns. The exact logic for determining trappability
    may depend on the game's internal threat calculation and positioning algorithms.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are valid and within expected ranges, as invalid
    inputs could lead to incorrect behavior in AI decision-making.
