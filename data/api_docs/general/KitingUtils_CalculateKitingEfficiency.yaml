  class: KitingUtils
  method: CalculateKitingEfficiency
  signature: float KitingUtils::CalculateKitingEfficiency(Player * bot, Unit * target,
    const int & kitingPos)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the kiting efficiency of a bot player against a target unit at
    a specified kiting position.
  description: The CalculateKitingEfficiency method evaluates how effectively a bot
    player can maintain distance from a target unit while dealing damage, using a
    specific kiting position. This utility is commonly used in AI-driven gameplay
    to determine optimal positioning strategies for ranged attackers. The method considers
    factors such as movement speed, attack range, and target mobility to compute an
    efficiency score between 0.0 (inefficient) and 1.0 (perfectly efficient). It requires
    a valid bot player and target unit, and assumes the kiting position is within
    reasonable bounds for the current environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will perform
      kiting behavior. Must be a valid player instance with proper AI settings.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that the bot is attempting to kite. Must
      be a valid unit with health and movement properties.
  - name: kitingPos
    description: Integer value representing the kiting position index or configuration
      identifier. Valid values are typically within a predefined range based on AI
      strategy settings.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the calculated kiting efficiency.
    A value of 1.0 represents perfect kiting efficiency, while 0.0 indicates no effective
    kiting behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float efficiency = KitingUtils::CalculateKitingEfficiency(botPlayer, targetUnit,\
      \ 2);\nif (efficiency > 0.7f) {\n    // Proceed with kiting strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with AI decision making
    code: "int bestKitingPos = 0;\nfloat maxEfficiency = 0.0f;\nfor (int i = 0; i\
      \ < MAX_KITING_POSITIONS; ++i) {\n    float efficiency = KitingUtils::CalculateKitingEfficiency(bot,\
      \ target, i);\n    if (efficiency > maxEfficiency) {\n        maxEfficiency\
      \ = efficiency;\n        bestKitingPos = i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestKitingPos\
      \ for AI movement decisions"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex calculations including distance, speed,
    and combat timing. It may be computationally intensive if called frequently during
    AI processing loops. The kiting position parameter should correspond to predefined
    positions in the bot's AI configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method; passing null pointers will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    The kitingPos value must be within expected bounds to avoid invalid calculations.
