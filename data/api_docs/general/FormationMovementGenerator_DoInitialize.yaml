  class: FormationMovementGenerator
  method: DoInitialize
  signature: void FormationMovementGenerator::DoInitialize(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the formation movement generator for a creature, setting up its
    positional relationship within a group.
  description: The DoInitialize method prepares a FormationMovementGenerator instance
    for use with a specific creature. It establishes the initial positioning and movement
    behavior of the creature relative to its formation leader. This method is typically
    invoked when a creature begins following a formation or when a new member joins
    an existing formation. The implementation likely sets up internal state variables
    such as offset positions, movement speed adjustments, and target tracking parameters
    that define how the creature will move in relation to other members of its formation.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that this movement generator will
      control. This parameter defines which creature's movement behavior will be managed
      by the formation logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature AI
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::InitializeFormation(Creature* creature)\n{\n    FormationMovementGenerator*\
      \ gen = new FormationMovementGenerator(creature, leaderGuid, offset);\n    gen->DoInitialize(creature);\n\
      \    creature->AddUnitState(UNIT_STATE_ROAMING);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI movement system in TrinityCore and should only
    be called after the FormationMovementGenerator has been properly constructed with
    valid parameters. The method modifies internal state but does not directly affect
    the creature's position or movement until DoUpdate is subsequently called.
  warnings: Calling DoInitialize without proper initialization of the FormationMovementGenerator
    object may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the creature pointer is valid
    and that the generator has been configured with appropriate formation parameters
    before invoking this method.
