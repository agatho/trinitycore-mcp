documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of items in the vendor's item list
  description: The GetItemCount method retrieves the count of all items currently
    stored within a VendorItemData object. This represents the total number of entries
    in the vendor's inventory, including both regular items and items that may be
    marked as sold out or unavailable. The method is typically used by the game server
    to determine how many items a vendor offers for sale, which can influence UI display
    logic, item availability checks, and inventory management routines. This count
    includes all item entries regardless of their sell status or availability state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of items in the vendor's item
    list. Returns 0 if the vendor has no items available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Vendor Item Count
    code: "VendorItemData* vendorData = sObjectMgr->GetVendorItemData(12345);\nuint32\
      \ itemCount = vendorData->GetItemCount();\nif (itemCount > 0)\n{\n    // Vendor\
      \ has items available\n    printf(\"Vendor has %u items for sale\\n\", itemCount);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Vendor has no items\n    printf(\"Vendor has no items for\
      \ sale\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Item Count in Inventory Management
    code: "void CheckVendorStock(uint32 vendorId)\n{\n    VendorItemData* vendorData\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetVendorItemData(vendorId);\n    if (!vendorData)\n       \
      \ return;\n\n    uint32 totalItems = vendorData->GetItemCount();\n    printf(\"\
      Vendor %u has %u items in stock\\n\", vendorId, totalItems);\n\n    // Iterate\
      \ through all items to check availability\n    for (uint32 i = 0; i < totalItems;\
      \ ++i)\n    {\n        VendorItem* item = vendorData->GetItem(i);\n        if\
      \ (item)\n        {\n            printf(\"  Item ID: %u, Price: %u\\n\", item->item,\
      \ item->maxcount);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a simple count of all items in the vendor's data structure.
    It does not filter out sold-out or temporary unavailable items - it returns the
    total number of entries. The implementation is expected to be fast and efficient
    as it's called frequently during vendor interactions and UI updates.
  warnings: Be aware that this count includes all item entries, even those marked
    as unavailable or sold out. If you need to filter for only available items, additional
    logic must be implemented to check each item's availability status separately.
