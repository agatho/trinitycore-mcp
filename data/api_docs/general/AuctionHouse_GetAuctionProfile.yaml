  class: AuctionHouse
  method: GetAuctionProfile
  signature: AuctionProfile AuctionHouse::GetAuctionProfile(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction profile data for a specified player GUID.
  description: The GetAuctionProfile method fetches the auction-related profile information
    associated with a given player's unique identifier (GUID). This typically includes
    data such as the player's current auction listings, bid history, and other auction
    house-related settings or statistics. The method is used within the auction house
    system to manage and retrieve player-specific auction behaviors and records. It
    assumes that the player GUID corresponds to an existing player in the game database
    and returns a structured AuctionProfile object containing relevant data.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose auction profile
      is being retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID from the game database.
  returns: An AuctionProfile object containing the auction-related data for the specified
    player, including their active auctions, bids, and other auction house settings.
    Returns an empty or default-initialized AuctionProfile if no data exists for the
    given player GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AuctionProfile profile = auctionHouse->GetAuctionProfile(12345);\nif (!profile.IsEmpty())\
      \ {\n    // Process the auction profile data\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for Active Auctions
    code: "uint32 playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nAuctionProfile profile\
      \ = auctionHouse->GetAuctionProfile(playerId);\nif (profile.GetActiveAuctionsCount()\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Player has active auctions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a database lookup to fetch player-specific auction
    data. It may cache results for performance if called multiple times with the same
    GUID within a short timeframe. Ensure that the provided playerGuid is valid and
    corresponds to an existing player in the game world.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or return an empty profile. Always validate the input GUID
    before calling this method if unsure of its validity.
