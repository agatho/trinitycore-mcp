documentation:
  brief: Applies weapon damage to a player's weapon slot based on item characteristics
  description: This method handles the application of weapon damage to a specific
    weapon slot on a player, typically used during equipment changes or when items
    are equipped/unequipped. It processes the weapon damage calculation based on the
    item's properties and applies it to the player's attack power or damage stats.
    The method is crucial for maintaining proper game mechanics related to weapon
    statistics and player performance.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The weapon slot to apply damage to, typically representing the main
      hand, off-hand, or ranged weapon slot
  - name: item
    description: The item whose damage characteristics are being applied to the weapon
      slot
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply or remove the damage from
      the weapon slot
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Weapon Damage Application Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Item* item = player->GetItemBySlot(10);

      player->_ApplyWeaponDamage(10, item, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of weapon damage calculation based
    on item quality and enchantment levels. Performance considerations involve avoiding
    unnecessary calculations when items are not properly equipped. Thread safety is
    ensured through proper synchronization of player equipment changes.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player's equipment is properly
    updated, as incorrect usage can lead to inaccurate attack power calculations or
    damage stats. Common mistakes include applying damage to non-existent weapon slots
    or using invalid item references.
