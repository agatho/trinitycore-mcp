  class: FormationManager
  method: AdjustForThreatSpread
  signature: void FormationManager::AdjustForThreatSpread(const int & threats)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts formation positions based on threat distribution among nearby units
  description: The AdjustForThreatSpread method modifies the positioning of units
    within a formation to account for threat levels, ensuring that higher-threat targets
    are positioned appropriately relative to other group members. This helps maintain
    optimal combat effectiveness and unit coordination during encounters. The method
    likely redistributes units in response to dynamic threat changes, potentially
    reorganizing their positions to reduce overlap or improve tactical positioning.
    It is typically invoked when threat levels within a group change significantly,
    such as during boss fights or complex encounters where threat distribution affects
    overall strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: threats
    description: Reference to an integer representing the current threat level distribution
      among units in the formation. This value indicates how threat is spread across
      the group and influences positioning decisions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Spread Adjustment
    code: 'int currentThreat = 150;

      formationManager->AdjustForThreatSpread(currentThreat);

      // Adjusts formation based on current threat level of 150'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Threat Spread Update
    code: "void UpdateFormationWithThreat(int newThreatValue)\n{\n    formationManager->AdjustForThreatSpread(newThreatValue);\n\
      }\n\n// Called when threat changes during combat\nUpdateFormationWithThreat(target->GetThreatLevel());"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called frequently during combat encounters, so performance
    optimization is important. The implementation likely uses heuristics to determine
    optimal positioning based on threat values and unit roles within the formation.
  warnings: Improper handling of threat values could lead to incorrect positioning
    decisions that negatively impact group performance. Ensure threat data is properly
    synchronized with the formation's internal state before calling this method.
