documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all battleground master entries from the database into
    memory.
  description: The LoadBattleMastersEntry method is responsible for loading all battleground
    master entries from the database into the in-memory data structures used by the
    BattlegroundMgr. This method is typically called during server startup or when
    the battleground system needs to refresh its internal data. It populates the battleground
    master list with information about available battlegrounds, their IDs, names,
    and other relevant metadata required for player matchmaking and battleground initialization.
    The method ensures that all battleground masters are properly registered and accessible
    for use in the game's battleground system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'BattlegroundMgr* bgMgr = sBattlegroundMgr;

      bgMgr->LoadBattleMastersEntry();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup as part
    of the battleground manager initialization process. It performs database queries
    to fetch all battleground master entries and caches them in memory for fast access
    during gameplay. The method should only be called once during the server's lifetime,
    typically at startup, unless the battleground data needs to be refreshed.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate entries or
    memory leaks if not handled properly. It should never be called from within a
    game loop or high-frequency code paths as it involves database access and memory
    allocation operations.
