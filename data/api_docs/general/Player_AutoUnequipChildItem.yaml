documentation:
  brief: Automatically unequips a child item from the player's inventory when the
    parent item is removed.
  description: This method handles the automatic removal of a child item from a player's
    inventory when a parent item is unequipped. It ensures that any child items (such
    as gems or enchantments) attached to the parent item are properly removed and
    returned to the player's inventory. The function operates within the context of
    World of Warcraft's item management system, where certain items may have dependencies
    on other items for proper functionality. This method is typically used during
    item removal processes, such as when an item is unequipped from a slot or when
    an item is destroyed.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Item* parentItem = new Item();

      player->AutoUnequipChildItem(parentItem);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of item dependencies, inventory management
    logic, and proper removal of child items. Performance considerations involve ensuring
    that the method does not cause unnecessary overhead during item operations. Thread
    safety is not a concern for this method as it operates within single-threaded
    context.
