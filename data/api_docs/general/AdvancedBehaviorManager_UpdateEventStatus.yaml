  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::UpdateEventStatus()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the status of all active events within the advanced behavior manager.
  description: The UpdateEventStatus method is responsible for processing and updating
    the current state of all events managed by the AdvancedBehaviorManager. This method
    typically iterates through registered events, evaluates their conditions, and
    applies necessary state changes or triggers associated actions. It serves as a
    core component in maintaining dynamic AI behavior and event-driven systems within
    TrinityCore's creature and game object scripting framework. The method is commonly
    invoked during the game loop to ensure real-time responsiveness of event-based
    behaviors.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Update all active events\n    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->UpdateEventStatus();\n\
      \    // Other update logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain proper
    event state management. It may involve iterating through potentially large numbers
    of events, so performance considerations are important in high-frequency scenarios.
