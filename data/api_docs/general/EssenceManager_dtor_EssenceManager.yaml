documentation:
  brief: Destroys an EssenceManager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the EssenceManager class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the manager. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this typically involves releasing
    references to essence-related data structures, clearing internal caches, and ensuring
    proper cleanup of any tracked essence effects or modifications. This method is
    automatically invoked when an EssenceManager object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted, making it crucial for memory management and preventing resource leaks
    within the game's essence system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of EssenceManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    EssenceManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n    // manager is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of EssenceManager pointer
    code: 'EssenceManager* manager = new EssenceManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Calls destructor

      manager = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory
    through pointers. It is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when
    objects go out of scope or are deleted. Ensure that all references to essence
    data are properly invalidated before destruction to prevent dangling pointers.
  warnings: Avoid calling this destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it
    will be called automatically. Be cautious when using smart pointers or manual
    memory management with EssenceManager instances, as improper handling can lead
    to double deletion errors or memory corruption.
