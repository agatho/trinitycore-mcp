documentation:
  brief: Adds a use to the GameObject, incrementing its use count.
  description: The AddUse method is used to increment the usage count of a GameObject,
    typically employed when the object is interacted with by players or other entities.
    This method is part of the GameObject's internal mechanics and is often invoked
    during interaction handling. It serves as a way to track how many times an object
    has been used, such as a door, chest, or quest item. The method does not require
    any parameters and is typically called internally during gameplay operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->AddUse();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is generally called internally during object interaction events
    and may be used in conjunction with other methods like SetGoState or UpdateVisibility.
    It does not directly affect the GameObject's visual appearance but contributes
    to its internal state tracking.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in scenarios involving multiple
    threads, as it may lead to race conditions if not properly synchronized. Also,
    calling AddUse on objects that are not meant to be used may result in unexpected
    behavior or data corruption.
