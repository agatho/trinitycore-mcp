documentation:
  brief: Sends object update packets to all players within the map's active range.
  description: The SendObjectUpdates method is responsible for processing and broadcasting
    object updates to all players currently within the map's active cells. This method
    iterates through all active players in the map and sends them the necessary update
    packets for objects that have changed since the last update cycle. It is typically
    called during the map's update loop to ensure that client-side world state remains
    synchronized with server-side object states. The method handles both static and
    dynamic object updates, including unit movement, item changes, and environmental
    modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in map update loop
    code: "void Map::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n \
      \   SendObjectUpdates();\n    // ... more update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual object update trigger
    code: "void MyCustomMap::TriggerObjectUpdates()\n{\n    // Force immediate object\
      \ updates for all players\n    SendObjectUpdates();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically during the map's update cycle
    and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required. The method operates
    on a per-map basis and only affects players within that specific map instance.
    Performance considerations include the number of active players and objects requiring
    updates, as each update packet consumes bandwidth and processing time.
  warnings: Calling this method excessively or outside of the normal update cycle
    may cause synchronization issues or performance degradation. The method assumes
    that all object states are properly marked for update before being called. Avoid
    calling this method from within object update handlers to prevent potential recursion
    issues.
