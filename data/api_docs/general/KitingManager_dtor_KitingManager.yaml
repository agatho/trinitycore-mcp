  class: KitingManager
  method: ~KitingManager
  signature: void KitingManager::~KitingManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the KitingManager instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The ~KitingManager destructor is responsible for cleaning up resources
    associated with the KitingManager object. This includes releasing any allocated
    memory, canceling ongoing kiting-related operations, and ensuring proper shutdown
    of internal data structures. The destructor is automatically invoked when a KitingManager
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that no dangling
    pointers or memory leaks occur during the destruction of kiting behavior management
    components within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of KitingManager instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    KitingManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when manager goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is part of the standard C++ RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern used throughout TrinityCore for proper resource management.
