  signature: void TradeSystem::UpdateScamDetectionDatabase(uint32 suspectedScammer)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the scam detection database with a suspected scammer's identifier.
  description: The UpdateScamDetectionDatabase method is responsible for maintaining
    the integrity of the game's trade system by updating internal records of players
    who are flagged as potential scammers. This method takes a single parameter representing
    the unique identifier (GUID) of a player suspected of engaging in fraudulent trading
    activities. The method likely performs database operations to log this suspicion,
    potentially incrementing a scam flag counter or adding the player to a temporary
    blacklist. It is designed to be called during trade transactions when suspicious
    behavior is detected, helping to protect other players from fraudulent activity.
    This method does not return any value and operates as a void function within the
    TradeSystem class.
  parameters:
  - name: suspectedScammer
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player suspected of scamming
      in trade transactions. This parameter represents the target player whose trading
      behavior has been flagged for review by the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TradeSystem* tradeSys = sWorld->GetTradeSystem();

      uint32 scammerGUID = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      tradeSys->UpdateScamDetectionDatabase(scammerGUID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger anti-scam system that may include
    additional mechanisms such as reputation tracking, transaction logging, and automated
    alerts. The implementation may involve database transactions to ensure data consistency
    when updating scam records.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper validation could lead to false
    accusations or database corruption. This method should only be called after verifying
    suspicious trading behavior to prevent abuse.
