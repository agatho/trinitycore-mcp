  class: DB2Manager
  method: GetDefaultMapDifficulty
  signature: const MapDifficultyEntry * DB2Manager::GetDefaultMapDifficulty(uint32
    mapId, Difficulty * difficulty) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the default map difficulty entry for a specified map ID and difficulty
    level.
  description: The GetDefaultMapDifficulty method fetches the default difficulty settings
    for a given map ID, returning a pointer to the corresponding MapDifficultyEntry
    structure. This entry contains information such as the default difficulty level,
    loot and experience multipliers, and other game mechanics modifiers that apply
    to the specified map. The method takes an optional difficulty parameter which
    can be used to retrieve the difficulty entry for a specific difficulty mode. If
    no matching entry is found, the method may return nullptr or a default fallback
    entry depending on internal implementation. This functionality is crucial for
    determining how game content scales and behaves across different difficulty levels
    in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map for which to retrieve the default
      difficulty settings. Valid values are map identifiers defined in the game's
      DB2 files.
  - name: difficulty
    description: Pointer to a Difficulty enum value that specifies the difficulty
      level. If nullptr, the method will use the default difficulty level for the
      map.
  returns: Returns a pointer to a MapDifficultyEntry structure containing the default
    difficulty settings for the specified map and difficulty level. Returns nullptr
    if no matching entry is found or if invalid parameters are provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get default difficulty for a map
    code: "const MapDifficultyEntry* difficultyEntry = sDB2Manager->GetDefaultMapDifficulty(1234,\
      \ nullptr);\nif (difficultyEntry)\n{\n    // Use the difficulty entry\n    printf(\"\
      Default difficulty: %u\\n\", difficultyEntry->Difficulty);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Retrieving difficulty for a specific difficulty level
    code: "Difficulty diff = DIFFICULTY_NORMAL;\nconst MapDifficultyEntry* difficultyEntry\
      \ = sDB2Manager->GetDefaultMapDifficulty(1234, &diff);\nif (difficultyEntry)\n\
      {\n    // Process the difficulty entry\n    printf(\"Map %u, Difficulty %u:\
      \ Loot multiplier %.2f\\n\", 1234, diff, difficultyEntry->LootMultiplier);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures and assumes that the MapDifficulty.db2
    file has been properly loaded. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the
    DB2Manager instance remains active and no reload operations occur. This method
    may be called from multiple threads, but thread safety depends on the underlying
    implementation of DB2Manager.
  warnings: The returned MapDifficultyEntry pointer should not be modified directly
    as it points to read-only data structures within the DB2 manager. Calling this
    method with invalid map IDs or difficulty values may result in undefined behavior
    or nullptr returns.
