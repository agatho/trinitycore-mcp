documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LootRoll object and releases its associated resources.
  description: The LootRoll destructor is responsible for cleaning up all resources
    associated with a loot roll instance. When a LootRoll object is destroyed, it
    ensures that any memory allocated for tracking the roll state, player participation,
    and item distribution is properly released. This includes removing the roll from
    active loot systems, notifying involved parties of the roll's conclusion, and
    preventing further interactions with the roll. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when a LootRoll object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of LootRoll object
    code: 'LootRoll* roll = new LootRoll(12345, 67890);

      // ... some operations ...

      delete roll; // This calls the destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via scope
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    LootRoll roll(12345, 67890);\n    // ... operations\
      \ ...\n    // roll is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor ensures that no dangling references or memory leaks occur
    when a LootRoll object is destroyed. It's important to note that the destruction
    process may involve database updates and network notifications to maintain consistency
    across the game world.
