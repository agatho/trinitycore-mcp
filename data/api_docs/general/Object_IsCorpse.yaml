documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is a corpse
  description: The IsCorpse method checks if the current Object instance represents
    a corpse within the World of Warcraft environment. This method is commonly used
    in game logic to distinguish between player characters and their corpse objects
    after death. It returns true when the object is a corpse, false otherwise. The
    method is typically used in conjunction with other corpse-related functionality
    such as retrieving corpse data or managing player resurrection mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is a corpse, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the current object represents a dead player character's body rather than
    a living character.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (obj->IsCorpse()) {\n    // Handle corpse-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Object* obj = player->GetCorpse();\nif (obj && obj->IsCorpse()) {\n   \
      \ // Perform actions on corpse\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Object class hierarchy and relies on internal
    object type checking. It should be used in conjunction with other methods that
    determine object types to ensure proper handling of corpse objects. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if an object is a player,
    as it only checks for corpse status. Use IsPlayer() or similar methods for player
    identification.
