documentation:
  brief: Initializes a falling movement spline for an object
  description: The SetFall method configures the MoveSplineInit object to initiate
    a falling motion. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server to handle gravity-based movement for units, such as when a player or creature
    falls from a height. It sets up the necessary spline parameters to simulate realistic
    falling physics including acceleration due to gravity. The method prepares the
    spline for execution but does not immediately start the movement; it must be followed
    by a call to Finish() or similar method to activate the spline.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Falling Movement Setup
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init(movementInfo);

      init.SetFall();

      init.Launch();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the object is in a state where falling
    is appropriate, such as when it has lost ground support. The spline will automatically
    apply gravity forces during execution. This method modifies internal spline parameters
    and should not be called while a spline is already active.
  warnings: Calling SetFall() on an object that is already moving with another spline
    type may cause unexpected behavior or override existing movement. Always ensure
    the object's current state is compatible with falling motion before calling this
    method.
