  class: EssenceResource
  method: Initialize
  signature: void EssenceResource::Initialize(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the essence resource manager with the provided bot reference.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the EssenceResource class for use with
    a specified bot instance. This method prepares internal data structures and configurations
    needed to manage essence resources within the context of the provided bot. It
    is typically called during the initialization phase of a bot's lifecycle to ensure
    proper setup before any resource operations are performed. The method does not
    perform any validation on the input pointer, so it is assumed that the provided
    bot reference is valid and properly initialized.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot instance identifier. This
      parameter should point to a valid bot context or identifier used internally
      by the essence resource system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'int botId = 42;

      EssenceResource resource;

      resource.Initialize(&botId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during the initialization of a bot's
    essence resource management system. It is important to ensure that the bot parameter
    points to a valid and initialized bot context before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid bot reference may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate the bot parameter before calling Initialize.
