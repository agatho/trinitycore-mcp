  method: DiscoverMigrationFiles
  signature: std::vector<MigrationFile> PlayerbotMigrationMgr::DiscoverMigrationFiles()
documentation:
  brief: Discovers and returns all available playerbot migration files in the system.
  description: The DiscoverMigrationFiles method scans the designated directories
    for playerbot migration files and returns a vector of MigrationFile objects representing
    each discovered file. This method is typically used during server startup or configuration
    updates to identify which migration scripts need to be applied to playerbot data.
    The method does not perform any actual migration operations; it only enumerates
    available files. It may filter out invalid or duplicate entries based on internal
    validation rules. The returned vector contains full path information and metadata
    about each migration file, enabling subsequent processing such as version checking
    or execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<MigrationFile> containing all discovered playerbot migration
    files. Each MigrationFile object includes path information, version details, and
    other metadata required for migration processing. Returns an empty vector if no
    valid migration files are found in the configured directories.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to list available migrations
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr* mgr = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance();\nstd::vector<MigrationFile>\
      \ migrations = mgr->DiscoverMigrationFiles();\nfor (const auto& file : migrations)\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Found migration: \" << file.path << \" (version: \"\
      \ << file.version << \")\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs filesystem operations and may have performance implications
    if there are many migration files. The discovery process might involve recursive
    directory traversal and file validation checks. It is recommended to cache the
    results of this method rather than calling it repeatedly during runtime.
  warnings: The method assumes that migration files follow a specific naming convention
    and format. Unexpected file types or malformed metadata may cause individual entries
    to be skipped or result in undefined behavior. Ensure proper permissions are set
    on migration directories to avoid access denied errors.
