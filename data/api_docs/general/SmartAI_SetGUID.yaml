  method: SetGUID
  signature: void SmartAI::SetGUID(const int & guid, int32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a GUID value for a specified ID within the SmartAI system
  description: The SetGUID method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to a specific
    ID slot within the SmartAI framework. This allows for tracking and referencing
    of game objects, creatures, or game events using a standardized identifier system.
    The method operates on internal data structures that maintain mappings between
    numeric IDs and GUIDs, which are commonly used in AI behavior scripting and event
    handling. The operation is typically performed during AI initialization or when
    an object needs to be linked to a specific identifier for later reference.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: Reference to the GUID value to be set. This represents a unique identifier
      for a game object, creature, or event within the TrinityCore system.
  - name: id
    description: The numeric ID slot to associate with the provided GUID. This serves
      as an index or key for retrieving the GUID later in AI logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GUID Assignment
    code: "void OnSpawn()\n{\n    // Assign a GUID to ID slot 1\n    SetGUID(123456,\
      \ 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Multiple GUIDs
    code: "void InitializeAI()\n{\n    // Set multiple GUIDs for different AI actions\n\
      \    SetGUID(player->GetGUID(), 0);\n    SetGUID(npc->GetGUID(), 1);\n    SetGUID(questGiver->GetGUID(),\
      \ 2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI system's internal state management. The
    GUID values are typically obtained from game objects using GetGUID() methods.
    The ID parameter should be within valid range for the AI script's configuration,
    and duplicate ID assignments may overwrite previous mappings.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID value passed is valid and represents an actual existing
    object in the world. Using invalid or uninitialized GUIDs can lead to undefined
    behavior during AI execution. Avoid setting the same ID multiple times without
    understanding the implications of overwriting previous values.
