  signature: uint32 FeralBleedTracker::GetRakeTimeRemaining(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time remaining in milliseconds for the Rake bleed effect on a
    target.
  description: The GetRakeTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration left on the
    Rake ability's bleed effect applied to a specific target. This method is typically
    used by Feral Druids to track the status of their Rake ability, which deals periodic
    damage over time. The returned value represents the milliseconds until the bleed
    effect expires. If no Rake effect is active on the specified target, the method
    may return 0 or a default value indicating no active effect. This functionality
    is crucial for managing rotation timing and ensuring optimal damage output in
    combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the time remaining (in milliseconds)
    for the Rake bleed effect on the target. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    that no Rake effect is currently active on the target.
  examples:
  - title: Check Rake Duration Before Applying
    code: "uint32 rakeTime = feralBleedTracker->GetRakeTimeRemaining(targetGuid);\n\
      if (rakeTime == 0)\n{\n    // Apply Rake since it's not active\n    caster->CastSpell(target,\
      \ RAKE_SPELL_ID, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Rake is active, consider refreshing\
      \ or using other abilities\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking of spell effects and their
    durations. It may be part of a larger system that manages debuff timers for Feral
    Druids. The implementation probably uses GUID-based lookups to identify specific
    targets.
  warnings: Ensure that the target GUID passed to this method corresponds to an actual
    unit in the game world, as invalid or non-existent GUIDs could lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results.
