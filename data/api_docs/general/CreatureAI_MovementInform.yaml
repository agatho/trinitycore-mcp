documentation:
  brief: Handles movement completion events for creatures in the AI system
  description: The MovementInform method is called by the TrinityCore AI framework
    when a creature's movement has been completed. This method serves as a callback
    mechanism that allows custom AI implementations to respond to movement events,
    such as when a creature finishes pathing, fleeing, or performing any other type
    of movement behavior. The method receives two integer parameters that typically
    represent the movement type and associated data, enabling the AI to distinguish
    between different types of movement completions and take appropriate actions.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Movement type identifier that specifies what kind of movement has
      completed. Common values include waypoint pathing, fleeing, evading, or custom
      movement types defined by the AI implementation.
  - name: param1
    description: Additional data associated with the movement completion. This could
      represent a specific waypoint index, target ID, or other context-dependent information
      depending on the movement type.
  returns: null

    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void MovementInform(int\
      \ moveType, int data) override {\n        if (moveType == POINT_MOTION_TYPE)\
      \ {\n            // Handle point movement completion\n            if (data ==\
      \ 100) {\n                // Specific waypoint reached\n                Talk(0);\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\n};"

  - title: Advanced Movement Inform with State Management
    code: "class AdvancedCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\nprivate:\n    bool m_isFleeing\
      \ = false;\n    uint32 m_fleeTimer = 0;\npublic:\n    void MovementInform(int\
      \ moveType, int data) override {\n        if (moveType == FLEEING_MOTION_TYPE\
      \ && m_isFleeing) {\n            // Flee movement completed\n            m_isFleeing\
      \ = false;\n            m_fleeTimer = 5000; // Set cooldown\n            //\
      \ Resume normal behavior after fleeing\n            DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI callback system and should be overridden
    in custom AI implementations. The parameters are typically set by the core movement
    system and may vary depending on the specific movement generator used for the
    creature. It's important to note that this method is only called when movement
    actually completes, not during intermediate steps.
  warnings: Do not perform heavy operations within this method as it's called from
    the main game loop thread. Avoid calling functions that might block or cause significant
    delays. Also, be aware that movement completion events may not always be sent
    for all movement types, particularly if the creature is interrupted before completing
    its movement.
