documentation:
  brief: Handles the application of offensive cooldowns for the Druid AI during combat.
  description: The HandleOffensiveCooldowns method is responsible for managing and
    applying offensive abilities that are on cooldown within the Druid AI's combat
    behavior. This method evaluates whether it's appropriate to use offensive spells
    or abilities, considering their current cooldown status, mana availability, and
    target conditions. It integrates with the overall AI decision-making process to
    ensure optimal usage of offensive capabilities during encounters. The method typically
    returns true if an offensive ability was successfully applied or false if no suitable
    action could be taken.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if an offensive cooldown was successfully handled and applied;
    otherwise returns false if no valid offensive action could be performed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI Loop
    code: "if (druidAI->HandleOffensiveCooldowns(&targetId)) {\n    // Offensive ability\
      \ was used\n    // Continue with other AI logic\n} else {\n    // No offensive\
      \ cooldown available or conditions not met\n    // Proceed to defensive or movement\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the Druid AI's main update loop during
    combat situations. It assumes that target information and spell availability have
    already been validated. The method may interact with internal cooldown tracking
    systems and should be used in conjunction with other AI methods for complete behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that target validation occurs before calling this method, as improper
    targeting can lead to invalid spell casting attempts. This method does not handle
    target selection or validity checks directly.
