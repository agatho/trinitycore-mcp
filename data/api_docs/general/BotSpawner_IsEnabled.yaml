  - title: Basic usage to check if bot spawner is active
    code: "if (botSpawner.IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawning logic\n\
      \    botSpawner.SpawnBots();\n} else {\n    // Handle disabled state\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot spawner is currently disabled.\");\n}"

  notes: This method likely checks internal flags or configuration states to determine
    if the bot spawning functionality should be active. It's commonly used in conjunction
    with other methods like Enable() and Disable() to control the lifecycle of bot
    spawning operations.
