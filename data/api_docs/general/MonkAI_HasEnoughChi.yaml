  class: MonkAI
  method: HasEnoughChi
  signature: bool MonkAI::HasEnoughChi(int amount) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Monk AI has enough chi to perform an action
  description: The HasEnoughChi method evaluates whether the current Monk AI instance
    possesses a sufficient amount of chi energy to execute a specified ability or
    skill. This method is typically used during AI decision-making processes to determine
    if a monk should proceed with chi-based abilities such as Tiger Palm, Blackout
    Kick, or other chi-consuming spells. The check considers the monk's current chi
    pool against the required chi amount for the intended action. This method does
    not modify any state and is purely a query operation.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The required chi amount needed to perform the action. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing the chi cost of the ability being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the Monk AI has equal to or more chi than the specified
    amount, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Check for Ability
    code: "if (monkAI.HasEnoughChi(2)) {\n    // Perform an ability that costs 2 chi\n\
      \    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_TIGER_PALM, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Chi-Based AI Decision
    code: "if (monkAI.HasEnoughChi(3) && !monkAI.IsCasting()) {\n    // Execute a\
      \ high-cost chi ability\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIST_OF_THE_WHITE_TIGER,\
      \ true);\n} else if (monkAI.HasEnoughChi(1)) {\n    // Fall back to a lower-cost\
      \ ability\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_TIGER_PALM, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal chi tracking mechanism of the Monk AI.
    It is recommended to call this method before attempting to cast chi-consuming
    spells to prevent errors. The method does not account for temporary chi modifications
    or buffs that might affect the actual chi available during spell casting.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is non-negative, as negative values may
    lead to unexpected behavior in the internal comparison logic. This method should
    not be used as a substitute for actual spell cost validation, but rather as a
    pre-check for AI decision-making.
