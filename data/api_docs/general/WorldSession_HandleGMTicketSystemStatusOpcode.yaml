    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGMTicketSystemStatusOpcode(WorldPackets::Ticket::GMTicketGetSystemStatus&\

      \ and sends it back to the client\n    SendPacket(&systemStatusPacket);\n}"

    or checks system status. The implementation relies on server-side configuration
    values that determine how tickets behave in the game world.
