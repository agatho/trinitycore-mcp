  class: World
  method: SetPersistentWorldVariable
  signature: void World::SetPersistentWorldVariable(const PersistentWorldVariable
    & var, int32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a persistent world variable with the specified value.
  description: The SetPersistentWorldVariable method stores a key-value pair in the
    world's persistent storage system. This allows game state information to be retained
    across server restarts and sessions. The method takes a PersistentWorldVariable
    enum identifier and an integer value, which are then saved to the database for
    future retrieval. This mechanism is commonly used for tracking global game events,
    server-wide settings, or other stateful data that must persist beyond individual
    player sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: var
    description: The PersistentWorldVariable enum identifier specifying which world
      variable to set. This defines the key for the persistent storage.
  - name: value
    description: The integer value to associate with the specified persistent world
      variable. This represents the data being stored for later retrieval.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Server-wide Event Flag
    code: World::instance()->SetPersistentWorldVariable(PERSISTENT_WORLD_VARIABLE_EVENT_HALLOWEEN_2023,
      1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Global Server Configuration
    code: World::instance()->SetPersistentWorldVariable(PERSISTENT_WORLD_VARIABLE_SERVER_MAX_PLAYERS,
      1000);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically performs database I/O operations to persist the variable.
    It may be called from any thread context, but internal synchronization is handled
    by the World instance. The persistent variables are usually loaded during server
    startup and saved periodically or on shutdown.
  warnings: Modifying persistent world variables can affect gameplay for all players.
    Ensure that changes are properly validated and do not introduce inconsistencies
    in game state. Avoid frequent updates to prevent performance degradation from
    excessive database writes.
