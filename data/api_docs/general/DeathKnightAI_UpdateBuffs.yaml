documentation:
  brief: Updates the Death Knight's buff states and manages aura applications based
    on current combat conditions.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for maintaining and applying
    appropriate auras and buffs to a Death Knight AI unit. It evaluates the current
    state of the Death Knight, including health, resource levels, and combat situation,
    to determine which buffs should be active or removed. This method typically runs
    during each AI update cycle and ensures that the Death Knight maintains optimal
    buff configurations for both survivability and damage output. The implementation
    considers factors such as rune regeneration, disease application, and strategic
    buff prioritization based on encounter phase.

    code: "void DeathKnightAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI framework during each
    tick of the Death Knight's behavior update cycle. Developers should be aware that
    this function may trigger spell casts or aura applications, which could affect
    performance if called too frequently outside of normal AI cycles.
