  signature: bool SmartScript::CheckTimer(const SmartScriptHolder & e) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a smart script timer has expired and should trigger its event.
  description: The CheckTimer method evaluates whether a given SmartScriptHolder's
    timer has reached zero or expired, indicating that the associated AI event should
    be executed. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore AI system to
    manage timed events for creatures, game objects, or areas. It checks internal
    timer state and returns true if the timer condition is met, allowing the script
    to proceed with execution of the next action in sequence. The method does not
    modify any state directly but serves as a predicate for conditional execution
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the timer associated with the provided SmartScriptHolder
    has expired or reached zero, indicating that its event should be triggered; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Check Usage
    code: "if (smartScript->CheckTimer(holder)) {\n    // Execute the smart script\
      \ event\n    smartScript->ExecuteScript(holder);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI scripting framework and should only
    be called from within the SmartScript system. It relies on accurate timing data
    maintained by the core engine, so any discrepancies in time tracking may lead
    to incorrect behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are implementing or debugging
    SmartScript logic. Incorrect usage can cause unexpected AI behavior or script
    execution errors.
