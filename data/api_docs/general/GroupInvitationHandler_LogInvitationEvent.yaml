    int inviterGuid, const std::string & reason) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a group invitation event with action type, inviter GUID, and reason.
  description: The LogInvitationEvent method records group invitation-related activities
    within the TrinityCore framework. It captures essential details about an invitation
    attempt including the action performed (such as 'INVITE' or 'DECLINE'), the GUID
    of the player who initiated the invitation, and a textual reason for the event.
    This functionality supports logging systems used for tracking player behavior,
    debugging invitation mechanics, and maintaining audit trails in group management
    operations. The method is typically invoked during group invitation workflows
    to ensure proper event recording.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: A string describing the type of invitation action performed (e.g.,
      'INVITE', 'DECLINE', 'ACCEPT'). This parameter defines the context of the logged
      event.
  - name: inviterGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player who initiated the
      group invitation. This value is used to track which player performed the action.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining the reason for the invitation event,
      such as 'Player declined' or 'Invitation sent'. Provides additional context
      for the logged activity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Log an invitation sent event
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.LogInvitationEvent("INVITE", 12345, "Player invited to group");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Log a declined invitation event
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.LogInvitationEvent("DECLINE", 67890, "Player declined invitation due
      to busy status");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the group management system and likely integrates
    with TrinityCore's logging infrastructure. It may be called from various parts
    of the codebase where invitations are processed or handled, such as in player
    interaction modules or group command handlers.
