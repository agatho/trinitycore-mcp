  brief: Exports performance metrics collected by the bot performance monitor to a
    specified file.
  description: The ExportMetrics method serializes all collected performance data
    from the BotPerformanceMonitor instance into a structured format and writes it
    to the provided filename. This functionality is typically used for debugging,
    analysis, or optimization purposes within the TrinityCore framework. The method
    does not require any specific preconditions but assumes that performance monitoring
    has been active and data has been gathered prior to invocation. It performs no
    validation on the filename parameter beyond basic file system access checks.

  notes: This method may block during file I/O operations depending on the system's
    file handling capabilities. It is recommended to call this method asynchronously
    or during low-traffic periods to avoid impacting server performance.
