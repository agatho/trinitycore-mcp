documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot spawner adapter, cleaning up all spawned bots and releasing
    associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the operation of the BotSpawnerAdapter
    by safely disposing of all active bot instances and freeing any allocated memory
    or system resources. This method ensures that all spawned bots are properly removed
    from the game world before the adapter is shut down. It is typically called during
    server shutdown or when the bot spawning functionality needs to be temporarily
    disabled. The method does not accept any parameters and performs no return operations,
    making it a simple cleanup function for the entire bot spawning system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnerAdapter* spawner = BotSpawnerAdapter::GetSingleton();

      spawner->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a state where it's
    safe to remove all bots. Calling Shutdown while bots are actively engaged in combat
    or quests may result in unexpected behavior or data loss.
