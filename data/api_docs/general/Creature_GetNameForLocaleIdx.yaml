  signature: std::string Creature::GetNameForLocaleIdx(LocaleConstant locale) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the creature's name for a specific locale.
  description: This method retrieves the localized name of a creature based on the
    specified locale constant. It is used to obtain the appropriate name string for
    different language versions of the game, allowing developers to access creature
    names in various locales. The method operates on the creature's internal name
    data and returns a string representation of the name.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::string containing the localized name of the creature for
    the specified locale. If no name is available for the given locale, an empty string
    is returned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      std::string name = creature->GetNameForLocaleIdx(LocaleConstant::LOCALE_en);

      std::cout << "Name: " << name << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with the creature's database
    data and may require access to the creature's internal name fields. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this is a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: This method should not be used for accessing names that aren't localized,
    as it will return an empty string if no localized version exists for the specified
    locale.
