  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: CalculateRoute
  signature: bool FlightMasterManager::CalculateRoute(const TaxiNodesEntry * from,
    const TaxiNodesEntry * to, int & route) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the flight route between two taxi nodes and returns the route
    identifier.
  description: The CalculateRoute method determines the optimal flight path between
    two taxi nodes in the World of Warcraft game world. It takes a starting node and
    destination node as input parameters and computes the appropriate route identifier
    that represents the path a player would take when flying from the source to the
    destination. This method is typically used by the Flight Master system to validate
    available routes and prepare for flight path activation. The method returns true
    if a valid route exists between the nodes, or false if no such route can be determined.
    The route identifier is stored in the output parameter 'route' which can then
    be used to access detailed flight path information from the game's taxi node database.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: Pointer to the TaxiNodesEntry representing the starting taxi node
      for the flight route. Must not be null and must correspond to a valid taxi node
      in the game world.
  - name: to
    description: Pointer to the TaxiNodesEntry representing the destination taxi node
      for the flight route. Must not be null and must correspond to a valid taxi node
      in the game world.
  - name: route
    description: Reference to an integer that will store the calculated route identifier
      upon successful execution. The value represents the unique identifier of the
      flight path between the two nodes.
  returns: True if a valid flight route exists between the specified taxi nodes and
    the route identifier has been successfully calculated. False if no route could
    be determined, which may occur if either node is invalid or if there is no direct
    or indirect flight connection between them.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flight Route Calculation
    code: "const TaxiNodesEntry* startNode = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      const TaxiNodesEntry* endNode = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(5678);\nint routeId\
      \ = 0;\n\nif (flightMasterManager.CalculateRoute(startNode, endNode, routeId))\
      \ {\n    // Route successfully calculated, use routeId for further processing\n\
      \    printf(\"Flight route ID: %d\\n\", routeId);\n} else {\n    // No valid\
      \ route exists between these nodes\n    printf(\"No flight route available.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal taxi node database and assumes that all
    provided TaxiNodesEntry pointers are valid and properly initialized. The implementation
    likely uses pathfinding algorithms to determine connectivity between nodes, potentially
    considering player faction, flight master availability, and zone restrictions.
    Performance may be impacted when dealing with large numbers of taxi nodes or complex
    route graphs.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'from' and 'to' parameters point to valid TaxiNodesEntry
    objects; passing null pointers will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes.
    The method does not validate whether the player has access to either taxi node,
    so additional checks may be required in game logic for proper flight path availability.
