  class: FeralBleedTracker
  method: HasRake
  signature: bool FeralBleedTracker::HasRake(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has the Rake ability active on their target.
  description: The HasRake method determines whether a specific player currently has
    the Rake ability applied to their target. This method is typically used in feral
    druid combat logic to track the state of the Rake debuff, which deals periodic
    damage and increases the effectiveness of other abilities. The method uses the
    player's GUID to identify the specific instance of the debuff. It is commonly
    called during combat updates or ability checks to ensure proper game mechanics
    are enforced.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified player has Rake active on their target, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Rake Status
    code: "if (feralBleedTracker->HasRake(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player has Rake active\n\
      \    // Apply additional effects or logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking of debuff states and may be
    part of a larger bleed tracker system that manages multiple abilities. The GUID
    parameter should correspond to a valid player object in the game world.
