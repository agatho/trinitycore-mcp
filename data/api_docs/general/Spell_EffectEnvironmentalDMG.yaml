  brief: Applies environmental damage to nearby targets within the spell's area of
    effect
  description: This method handles the application of environmental damage to all
    affected targets within the spell's radius. It is typically used for spells that
    cause damage from environmental sources such as lava, fire, or other elemental
    effects. The method calculates damage based on the spell's base damage and applies
    it to targets in the surrounding area, taking into account target resistance and
    other game mechanics. This function is commonly used in conjunction with other
    spell effect methods to create complete damage calculations.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::EffectEnvironmentalDMG()\n{\n    // Implementation would handle\
      \ environmental damage application\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires proper handling of target selection and damage calculation.
    It should be called only when the spell's effect is properly initialized and targets
    are correctly identified within the spell's area.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper spell initialization.
    The method assumes that all necessary parameters have been set and that the spell
    has been properly prepared for execution.
