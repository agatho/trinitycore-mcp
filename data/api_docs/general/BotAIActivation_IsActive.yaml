  class: BotAIActivation
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool BotAIActivation::IsActive(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a bot AI is currently active for the specified bot.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the Artificial Intelligence system
    for a specific bot is currently enabled and operational. This function is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to manage bot behavior states, ensuring
    that AI operations are only performed when the bot's AI is actively engaged. The
    method evaluates internal state flags or conditions associated with the bot's
    AI module to return a boolean result indicating activation status. It may be called
    during game loop iterations or in response to player commands affecting bot behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier of the bot
      whose AI activation status is being checked. This parameter should reference
      a valid bot instance within the TrinityCore system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot's AI is currently active and operational;
    otherwise, returns false. A return value of false typically indicates that the
    AI has been disabled, suspended, or not yet initialized for the given bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a bot's AI is active
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nif (botAIActivation->IsActive(&botId)) {\n    // Bot\
      \ AI is currently active\n    printf(\"Bot AI is active\\n\");\n} else {\n \
      \   // Bot AI is not active\n    printf(\"Bot AI is inactive\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the BotAIActivation
    class. It's important to ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid and registered
    bot instance to avoid undefined behavior. The method does not perform any side
    effects or modify the AI state directly.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or unregistered bot ID to this method may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. Always validate the bot reference before calling
    IsActive to ensure reliable operation.
