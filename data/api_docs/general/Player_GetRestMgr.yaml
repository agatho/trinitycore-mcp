  method: GetRestMgr
  signature: RestMgr & Player::GetRestMgr() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the rest management instance for the player, allowing access to rest-related
    functionality and data.
  description: The GetRestMgr method provides access to the RestMgr object associated
    with a player, which handles all aspects of player rest behavior including rest
    state, XP gain, and recovery mechanics. This method is essential for managing
    player rest status during gameplay and is typically used in conjunction with other
    rest-related functions to control how players recover from rest or manage their
    experience points. The returned reference allows direct manipulation of the player's
    rest state without requiring additional lookup operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to the RestMgr object associated with the player, enabling
    access to rest-related data and functionality including rest state, XP gain calculations,
    and recovery mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      RestMgr& restMgr = player->GetRestMgr();

      restMgr.SetRestState(REST_STATE_FULL);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nRestMgr& restMgr = player->GetRestMgr();\n\
      if (restMgr.GetRestState() == REST_STATE_FULL)\n{\n    // Perform actions based\
      \ on rest state\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a reference to the RestMgr object, which means modifications
    to this reference directly affect the player's rest state. This method is typically
    called during gameplay to access or modify rest-related data without additional
    overhead. The returned reference is valid only while the player object exists.
  warnings: Care should be taken when modifying the RestMgr reference as changes may
    affect player experience points and rest state. Modifications should be made carefully
    to avoid unintended consequences in game mechanics.
