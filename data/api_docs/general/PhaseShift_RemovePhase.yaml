  class: PhaseShift
  method: RemovePhase
  signature: int PhaseShift::RemovePhase(uint32 phaseId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified phase from the current PhaseShift object and returns
    the number of phases remaining.
  description: The RemovePhase method removes a phase identified by its unique phase
    ID from the current PhaseShift instance. This operation modifies the internal
    phase set of the object, effectively disabling the specified phase for the associated
    entity (such as a player or creature). The method returns an integer indicating
    how many phases remain after the removal. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    phases are used to control visibility and interaction with game objects, quests,
    and areas based on player progress or specific conditions. This method is typically
    used when a player completes a quest, enters a new zone, or when certain in-game
    events occur that require phase changes. The removal of a phase can affect what
    content the player sees or interacts with in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseId
    description: The unique identifier of the phase to be removed from the PhaseShift.
      This value must correspond to a valid phase ID that has been previously added
      to the PhaseShift object.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of phases remaining in the PhaseShift
    after the specified phaseId has been removed. If the phaseId was not found in
    the current set, the return value will be the original count of phases minus one
    (assuming successful removal). A negative return value may indicate an error condition
    or invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Phase Removal
    code: 'PhaseShift shift;

      shift.AddPhase(100);

      shift.AddPhase(200);

      int remaining = shift.RemovePhase(100); // Removes phase 100, returns 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Non-Existent Phase
    code: 'PhaseShift shift;

      shift.AddPhase(100);

      int remaining = shift.RemovePhase(300); // Phase 300 does not exist, returns
      -1 or unchanged count'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the phaseId passed is valid and has been previously
    added to the PhaseShift. It's important to ensure that the phase being removed
    is actually part of the current set to avoid unexpected behavior. The implementation
    may internally handle duplicate removals or invalid IDs gracefully, but callers
    should ideally validate before invoking this method.
  warnings: Calling RemovePhase with an invalid or non-existent phaseId might lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect phase state management. Always verify that
    the phase exists in the PhaseShift before attempting to remove it. Improper use
    can cause visual glitches or missing content for players.
