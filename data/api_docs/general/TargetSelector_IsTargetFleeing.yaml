  class: TargetSelector
  method: IsTargetFleeing
  signature: bool TargetSelector::IsTargetFleeing(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the specified target unit is currently fleeing from the AI controller.
  description: The IsTargetFleeing method determines whether a given target unit is
    in a fleeing state, which typically occurs when the unit has been damaged or is
    under threat and attempts to escape. This method is commonly used within AI decision-making
    logic to influence behavior such as pursuing or avoiding targets. The check considers
    the current movement state and any active flee mechanics applied to the unit.
    It returns true if the target is actively fleeing, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose fleeing
      status is being checked. Must not be null for valid results.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is currently in a fleeing state, false
    if it is not fleeing or if the input target is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (ai->IsTargetFleeing(target)) {\n    // Perform actions appropriate\
      \ for a fleeing target\n    ai->DoFleeAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within conditional logic
    code: "if (!ai->IsTargetFleeing(target) && target->GetHealth() < target->GetMaxHealth()\
      \ * 0.3f) {\n    // Target is not fleeing but is low on health, consider aggressive\
      \ action\n    ai->AttackTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI state tracking and may return false if
    the target unit does not have an active flee behavior or if the AI system has
    not properly initialized the flee state. The implementation checks for movement
    flags and specific flee-related conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. This method should only be called during active AI update
    cycles where target states are expected to be accurate.
