  class: ArenaTeam
  method: BroadcastPacket
  signature: void ArenaTeam::BroadcastPacket(WorldPacket * packet)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a WorldPacket to all members of the arena team.
  description: The BroadcastPacket method sends a specified WorldPacket to all online
    members of the arena team. This method is typically used to broadcast updates,
    notifications, or game state changes to all players in the team. The packet is
    transmitted directly to each member's client without any filtering or additional
    processing. This functionality is essential for maintaining synchronized communication
    within arena team instances, such as sending match start/end notifications, score
    updates, or team roster changes.

  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a simple arena update
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_ARENA_TEAM_COMMAND_RESULT, 4);

      packet << uint32(ARENA_TEAM_CREATE);

      packet << uint32(0);

      packet << uint32(0);

      arenaTeam->BroadcastPacket(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all team members are online and connected. It does
    not perform any checks for player availability or connection status before sending
    the packet. The method is typically called from within arena team management code
    where immediate communication with all team members is required.
  warnings: Be cautious when using BroadcastPacket as it sends data to every team
    member, which can impact performance if used excessively. Ensure that packets
    are only broadcast when necessary and contain only essential information to avoid
    network overhead.
