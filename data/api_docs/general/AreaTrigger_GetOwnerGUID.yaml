  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetOwnerGUID
  signature: int AreaTrigger::GetOwnerGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the object that owns this area trigger.
  description: The GetOwnerGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier of
    the entity that created or controls the area trigger. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, area triggers are often associated with players, creatures, or game
    objects. This GUID can be used to identify and reference the owner for various
    gameplay mechanics such as tracking, interaction, or conditional logic. The method
    is const, meaning it does not modify the state of the area trigger object. It
    is commonly used in spell effects, quest systems, or combat-related scripts where
    the relationship between an area trigger and its creator needs to be established.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the area trigger's owner. If
    no owner exists or the owner is invalid, the method may return 0 or a special
    sentinel value depending on implementation details within TrinityCore.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Identify Area Trigger Owner
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nuint64 ownerGUID\
      \ = trigger->GetOwnerGUID();\nif (ownerGUID != 0)\n{\n    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ownerGUID);\n\
      \    if (player)\n    {\n        // Perform actions based on the owner being\
      \ a player\n        player->SendNotification(\"You triggered an area effect.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the area trigger has been properly initialized with
    an owner. If used on an uninitialized or invalid area trigger, it may return a
    null GUID (typically 0). The returned GUID should be validated before use to avoid
    potential crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without verifying its validity.
    An invalid or zero GUID could lead to access violations if passed directly into
    functions expecting valid object references. Always check for valid GUIDs before
    attempting to retrieve objects from the world.
