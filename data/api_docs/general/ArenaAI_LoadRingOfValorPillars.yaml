documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the Ring of Valor pillars for arena combat.
  description: The LoadRingOfValorPillars method is responsible for setting up the
    visual and functional pillars that appear in the Ring of Valor arena. These pillars
    are part of the arena's decorative and interactive elements, typically used to
    define boundaries or provide environmental effects during combat. The method likely
    retrieves pillar data from configuration files or database entries, creates the
    necessary GameObjects, and ensures they are properly positioned within the arena
    environment. This method is typically called during the initialization phase of
    an arena match to prepare the battlefield for combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena Initialization
    code: "void Arena::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    _arenaAI.LoadRingOfValorPillars();\n\
      \    // Continue with other arena setup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called only once per arena match during the initial
    setup phase. The pillars may be destroyed and recreated between matches or rounds,
    depending on the arena's design. Implementation details may involve database lookups
    for pillar positions and GameObject templates.
  warnings: Ensure this method is not called multiple times during a single match
    as it could result in duplicate GameObjects. The method should only be invoked
    when the arena environment is properly initialized and ready to accept new GameObjects.
