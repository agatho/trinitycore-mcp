documentation:
  brief: Modifies spell duration time for a given spell info and spell instance
  description: This method adjusts the duration time of a spell based on the provided
    SpellInfo and Spell instances. It allows developers to modify how long a spell
    will last, which is crucial for implementing game mechanics such as spell duration
    changes, buffs/debuff effects, or custom spell behavior modifications. The method
    operates on the WorldObject's current spell duration settings and can be used
    to alter spell timing during runtime.
  parameters:
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure that defines the spell properties
      and characteristics
  - name: durationTime
    description: Reference to the duration time value that will be modified by this
      method
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell instance that is being modified
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void exampleFunction(WorldObject* obj, SpellInfo* spellInfo, Spell* spell)\n\
      {\n    int32 duration = 1000;\n    obj->ModSpellDurationTime(spellInfo, duration,\
      \ spell);\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell effects or during
    spell application logic to modify duration values dynamically. It should be used
    carefully as it may affect gameplay balance and spell mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell durations, affecting
    game balance. Ensure that the SpellInfo and Spell pointers are valid before calling
    this method.
