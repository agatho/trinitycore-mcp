  class: AtonementTracker
  method: RemoveAtonement
  signature: void AtonementTracker::RemoveAtonement(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes atonement data associated with the specified GUID from the tracker.
  description: The RemoveAtonement method is responsible for removing all atonement-related
    data linked to a specific player or entity identified by their globally unique
    identifier (GUID). This functionality is typically used within the context of
    World of Warcraft's atonement system, where players may accumulate atonement for
    various actions such as healing or damage dealt to certain targets. The method
    ensures that when an entity is no longer eligible for atonement tracking or when
    their data needs to be cleared (e.g., upon death or logout), the corresponding
    entries are removed from the internal tracking structure. It is important to note
    that this operation does not affect other systems or data unrelated to atonement.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier of the entity whose atonement data
      should be removed. This value uniquely identifies a player, NPC, or object within
      the TrinityCore world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to remove atonement for a player
    code: 'AtonementTracker tracker;

      uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      tracker.RemoveAtonement(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing atonement during a custom event handler
    code: "void OnPlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    AtonementTracker::Instance()->RemoveAtonement(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a map or similar data structure to
    store atonement entries keyed by GUID. The removal process should be efficient,
    ideally O(1) for hash-based containers. Ensure thread safety if this method is
    called from multiple threads concurrently.
  warnings: Calling RemoveAtonement with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result
    in undefined behavior depending on the implementation. Always verify that the
    GUID corresponds to a valid entity before invoking this method.
