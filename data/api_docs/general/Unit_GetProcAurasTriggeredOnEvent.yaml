  class: Unit
  method: GetProcAurasTriggeredOnEvent
  signature: void Unit::GetProcAurasTriggeredOnEvent(AuraApplicationProcContainer
    & aurasTriggeringProc, AuraApplicationList * procAuras, ProcEventInfo & eventInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves aura applications that trigger on specific events for a unit.
  description: This method collects and processes aura applications that are triggered
    by specific events, such as damage dealt or received, spell casting, or periodic
    effects. It is used to determine which auras should be applied or removed based
    on event conditions. The method handles the processing of aura applications in
    the context of event-driven triggers, ensuring proper application of effects during
    combat mechanics. This function is essential for managing proc-based systems and
    event handling within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: aurasTriggeringProc
    description: A reference to a container that holds aura applications which are
      triggered by events. This container stores the list of auras that should be
      processed based on event conditions.
  - name: procAuras
    description: An optional pointer to a list of aura applications that will be populated
      with proc-related auras. If null, no additional auras are added to this list.
  - name: eventInfo
    description: Reference to the event information structure containing details about
      the triggering event, such as type, source, target, and other relevant parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      AuraApplicationProcContainer procContainer;

      ProcEventInfo eventInfo;

      unit->GetProcAurasTriggeredOnEvent(procContainer, nullptr, eventInfo);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nAuraApplicationProcContainer procContainer;\nAuraApplicationList*\
      \ procAurasList = new AuraApplicationList;\nProcEventInfo eventInfo;\nunit->GetProcAurasTriggeredOnEvent(procContainer,\
      \ procAurasList, eventInfo);\n// Process the list of auras\nfor (auto aura :\
      \ *procAurasList)\n{\n    // Do something with each aura\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat-related systems where events trigger
    specific aura effects. It should be called during event processing to ensure proper
    handling of proc-based mechanics. The method may involve performance considerations
    due to the complexity of event handling and aura application processing.
  warnings: Improper handling of event information or aura containers can lead to
    memory leaks or incorrect application of auras. Care must be taken when using
    this method with multiple threads, as it may not be thread-safe.
