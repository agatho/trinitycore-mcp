documentation:
  brief: Initializes the cooldown tracking system for rogue class abilities.
  description: The InitializeRogueCooldowns method sets up and configures the internal
    cooldown management system specifically for rogue class abilities within the CooldownStackingOptimizer.
    This method prepares the optimizer to track and manage cooldowns for rogue-specific
    spells and abilities, ensuring proper stacking and timing strategies are applied
    during combat scenarios. It initializes necessary data structures and registers
    relevant cooldown events for the rogue class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeRogueCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the initialization phase of a rogue's
    combat logic. It prepares internal tracking structures but does not execute any
    cooldowns itself - it only sets up the framework for cooldown management.
