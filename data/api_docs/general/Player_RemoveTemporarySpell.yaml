documentation:
  brief: Removes a temporary spell from the player's spell book.
  description: This method removes a temporary spell from the player's spell book,
    effectively clearing the spell from the player's known spells. Temporary spells
    are typically used for various game mechanics such as race abilities, class spells,
    or other temporary effects that do not persist beyond the current session. The
    method ensures that the specified spell is removed from the player's list of known
    spells, preventing further use of the spell until it is re-added through other
    means.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell to be removed from the player's spell book. This
      must correspond to a valid temporary spell that has been previously added to
      the player's known spells.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveTemporarySpell(12345);

      // Removes spell ID 12345 from the player''s temporary spell list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AddTemporarySpell to manage
    temporary spells. It should be used carefully as it may affect gameplay mechanics
    such as race abilities or class spells that are temporarily added to the player's
    spell book.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to removal of valid spells from the
    player's spell book, which may cause issues with gameplay mechanics or character
    progression. Ensure that the spell ID being removed is actually a temporary spell
    and not a permanent one.
