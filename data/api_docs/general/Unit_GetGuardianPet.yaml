  method: GetGuardianPet
  signature: Guardian * Unit::GetGuardianPet() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the guardian pet of the unit if one exists.
  description: This method retrieves the guardian pet associated with the unit, which
    is a special type of pet that serves as a protective entity for the unit. The
    guardian pet is typically created when the unit has a specific type of pet such
    as a guardian or summoning pet. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to access and manage pet-related functionality within the
    game mechanics. It returns nullptr if no guardian pet exists, making it useful
    for checking pet existence before performing operations on the pet.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Guardian object representing the guardian pet
    of the unit, or nullptr if no guardian pet exists. The returned pointer may be
    null when the unit does not have a guardian pet active or when the pet is not
    properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (Guardian* pet = unit->GetGuardianPet()) {\n    // Pet exists, perform\
      \ operations\n}\nelse {\n    // No pet exists\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Guardian* pet = unit->GetGuardianPet();\nif (pet && pet->IsInWorld()) {\n\
      \    // Pet is active and in world\n    pet->Delete();\n}\nelse {\n    // Either\
      \ no pet or pet not in world\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may return nullptr if the unit
    does not have a guardian pet. It is important to check for null before using the
    returned pointer to avoid potential crashes. The method is typically used in conjunction
    with other pet-related methods to manage pet behavior and ownership.
  warnings: Using this method without checking for null can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior if no guardian pet exists. Care should be taken when accessing pet properties
    or performing operations on the returned Guardian object.
