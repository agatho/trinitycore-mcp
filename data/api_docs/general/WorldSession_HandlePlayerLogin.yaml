  method: HandlePlayerLogin
  signature: void WorldSession::HandlePlayerLogin(const LoginQueryHolder & holder)
documentation:
  brief: Processes player login by handling the initial authentication and session
    setup for a connecting character.
  description: The HandlePlayerLogin method is responsible for managing the player
    login process within the TrinityCore server. It takes a LoginQueryHolder object
    that contains pre-fetched data about the player, including character details,
    account information, and any pending operations. This method performs essential
    tasks such as validating the player's credentials, initializing session state,
    setting up the player's in-game presence, and triggering necessary events for
    login completion. The method is typically invoked during the connection handshake
    when a client attempts to log into the game world. It ensures that all required
    data is properly loaded and that the player's session is correctly configured
    before they can interact with the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: holder
    description: A const reference to a LoginQueryHolder object containing pre-fetched
      database query results for the player, including character information, account
      data, and any pending operations that need to be processed during login.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in login flow
    code: "void WorldSession::HandlePlayerLogin(const LoginQueryHolder& holder)\n\
      {\n    // Process player login with pre-fetched data\n    Player* player = new\
      \ Player(this);\n    player->LoadFromDB(holder.GetPlayerGuid(), this);\n   \
      \ SetPlayer(player);\n    SendLoginVerifyWorld();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core login flow and should only be called during
    the authentication phase. The LoginQueryHolder parameter must contain valid data,
    otherwise the login process will fail. This method may trigger additional database
    queries internally to complete player initialization.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without proper session setup. Improper
    handling of the LoginQueryHolder can lead to incomplete or failed character loading.
    Ensure that all required preconditions are met before invoking this method.
