documentation:
  brief: Updates the behavior of events within the advanced AI system based on elapsed
    time.
  description: The UpdateEventBehavior method is responsible for processing and updating
    event-based behaviors in the AdvancedBehaviorManager. It takes a time delta (diff)
    parameter to determine how much time has passed since the last update, allowing
    it to manage timed events, state transitions, and behavior modifications accordingly.
    This method is typically called from the main game loop or AI update cycle to
    ensure that event-driven behaviors remain synchronized with the passage of time.
    The method operates on internal event queues or lists managed by the AdvancedBehaviorManager,
    processing each event according to its defined logic and timing constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    m_AdvancedBehaviorManager->UpdateEventBehavior(diff);\n    // ... rest\
      \ of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain proper
    event timing. It's designed to handle multiple concurrent events efficiently and
    is typically invoked from within an AI update context where time deltas are available.
