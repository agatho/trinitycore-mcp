  signature: void DungeonScriptLoader::~DungeonScriptLoader()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DungeonScriptLoader instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~DungeonScriptLoader destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all dynamically allocated memory and resources held by the DungeonScriptLoader
    object. This includes releasing any script instances, unregistering callbacks,
    and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the loader is destroyed. In the context
    of TrinityCore's dungeon scripting system, this destructor ensures that all loaded
    dungeon scripts are properly unregistered from the game engine before the object
    is removed from memory. The method should be called automatically by the C++ runtime
    when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of DungeonScriptLoader
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    DungeonScriptLoader loader;\n    // ... use\
      \ loader ...\n    // Destructor called automatically here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of DungeonScriptLoader
    code: 'DungeonScriptLoader* loader = new DungeonScriptLoader();

      // ... use loader ...

      delete loader; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope or are explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call this
    destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction
    process ensures proper cleanup of script resources and prevents memory leaks in
    the TrinityCore dungeon scripting system.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor unless you have a specific reason
    and understand the implications. Improper handling can lead to resource leaks
    or undefined behavior. Since this is a destructor, it should never be called directly
    by user code except in very specific scenarios involving custom memory management.
