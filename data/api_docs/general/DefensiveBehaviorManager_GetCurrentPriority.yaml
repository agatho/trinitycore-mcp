documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current defensive priority level of the behavior manager
  description: The GetCurrentPriority method returns the active defensive priority
    level that the DefensiveBehaviorManager is currently using. This value determines
    how aggressively the AI should respond to threats and what defensive actions should
    be prioritized. The returned DefensivePriority enum typically represents different
    levels such as LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL, which influence the behavior of
    NPC units in combat situations. The method does not modify any internal state
    and is purely informational, allowing other systems to query the current defensive
    stance without altering it.
  parameters: []
  returns: A DefensivePriority enum value indicating the current defensive priority
    level. Possible values may include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL depending on
    the implementation, representing varying degrees of threat response intensity.
  examples:
  - title: Query Current Defensive Priority
    code: "DefensivePriority currentPriority = behaviorManager.GetCurrentPriority();\n\
      if (currentPriority == DefensivePriority::HIGH)\n{\n    // Handle high-priority\
      \ defensive behavior\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\", \"High defensive priority active\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision-making cycles to determine
    appropriate defensive actions. It's important to note that the returned value
    may change dynamically based on environmental factors, threat levels, or other
    game events. The method is thread-safe as it only reads from internal state without
    modification.
