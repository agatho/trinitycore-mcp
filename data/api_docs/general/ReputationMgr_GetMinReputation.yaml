documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum reputation required for a faction.
  description: The GetMinReputation method returns the minimum reputation value needed
    to achieve a specific standing with a given faction. This value is used internally
    by the game engine to determine whether a player has reached the threshold for
    a particular reputation level. The method takes a FactionEntry pointer as input,
    which represents the faction for which the minimum reputation is being queried.
    It's commonly used in reputation-related calculations and UI displays to show
    players their current standing relative to faction requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the minimum reputation threshold required
    for the specified faction. This value typically corresponds to the lower bound
    of a reputation level (e.g., 0 for Hated, 3000 for Neutral, etc.). A negative
    value may indicate special cases or error conditions depending on internal implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve minimum reputation for a faction
    code: 'const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1118); // Example
      faction ID

      int32 minRep = reputationMgr->GetMinReputation(faction);

      // Returns the minimum reputation value required for this faction'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ReputationMgr class which manages player reputation
    with various factions in World of Warcraft. The returned value directly corresponds
    to the faction's standing thresholds defined in the game's data files. This method
    does not perform any validation on the input FactionEntry pointer, so callers
    should ensure it's valid before calling.
