documentation:
  brief: Grants experience points to a pet, increasing its level and abilities.
  description: The GivePetXP method is used to provide experience points to a player's
    pet, which contributes to the pet's progression in levels and stats. This method
    directly affects the pet's current experience value and may trigger level-up logic
    if the accumulated experience meets or exceeds the threshold required for the
    next level. The method does not return any value and operates on the pet object
    it is called from. It is typically invoked during combat when the pet gains experience
    from defeating enemies, or through game mechanics that grant experience directly
    to the pet.
  parameters:
  - name: xp
    description: The amount of experience points to be added to the pet's current
      experience total. Must be a non-negative integer value representing the experience
      gain.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Granting Experience Points to a Pet
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->GivePetXP(100);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Granting Experience Based on Enemy Kill
    code: "Creature* enemy = ...; // obtained from combat\nPet* pet = player->GetPet();\n\
      if (pet && enemy)\n{\n    uint32 xpGain = enemy->GetUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_XP);\n\
      \    pet->GivePetXP(xpGain);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the pet's experience value and may trigger
    internal level-up checks. It is important to ensure that the XP amount passed
    is valid and non-negative, as invalid values could lead to unexpected behavior
    or exploits. The method does not perform any validation on the XP parameter beyond
    ensuring it's a positive integer.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very large value for xp may cause overflow
    issues or unexpected level-ups. Additionally, calling this method outside of appropriate
    combat or game logic contexts may result in inconsistent pet behavior or game
    state corruption.
