documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the SpellVisual ID associated with a spell for use in visual effects.
  description: This method returns the SpellVisual ID that corresponds to a specific
    spell, which is used to determine the visual representation of the spell in-game.
    The returned value may vary based on the caster and viewer objects provided, allowing
    for dynamic visual effects depending on the context. This method is essential
    for determining how spells appear visually to players and is commonly used in
    spell handling and visual effect calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the SpellVisual ID associated with the spell.
    This value typically corresponds to an entry in the SpellVisual.dbc file and determines
    the visual appearance of the spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);

      uint32 visualId = spellInfo->GetSpellXSpellVisualId(nullptr, nullptr);

      // visualId will contain the SpellVisual ID for spell 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related APIs
    to determine visual effects. It may return different values depending on the caster
    and viewer, making it context-sensitive. Performance-wise, this method should
    be used carefully as it involves database lookups.
  warnings: This method may return zero if no SpellVisual ID is defined for the spell,
    which could lead to missing visual effects in-game. Ensure that the spell exists
    in the database before calling this method.
