  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: ExecuteCommand
  signature: CommandResult BotChatCommandHandler::ExecuteCommand(const CommandContext
    & context, const ChatCommand & command)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a chat command within the bot's context, processing the command
    and returning the result of its execution.
  description: The ExecuteCommand method is responsible for handling and executing
    chat commands issued within the TrinityCore bot system. It takes a CommandContext
    and ChatCommand as input parameters, processes the command according to the bot's
    logic, and returns a CommandResult indicating success or failure of the operation.
    This method serves as the core handler for all bot-related chat commands in the
    World of Warcraft emulation environment. The method ensures proper command validation,
    execution flow, and appropriate response handling within the bot's communication
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: The CommandContext containing information about the command execution
      environment including player, session, and command source details
  - name: command
    description: The ChatCommand structure defining the specific command to be executed,
      including command name, parameters, and access level requirements
  returns: CommandResult indicating whether the command was successfully processed
    (COMMAND_OK), failed due to invalid syntax or permissions (COMMAND_FAILED), or
    resulted in an error condition (COMMAND_ERROR). The result may also indicate if
    the command was not recognized or handled by this specific handler.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Execution
    code: "CommandResult result = botHandler.ExecuteCommand(context, chatCommand);\n\
      if (result == COMMAND_OK) {\n    // Command executed successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot command executed successfully\");\n} else {\n    // Handle command failure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Bot command failed with result: %d\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Command Execution with Error Handling
    code: "CommandContext context;\nChatCommand command;\ncommand.command = \"help\"\
      ;\ncommand.parameters = \"\";\n\nCommandResult result = botHandler.ExecuteCommand(context,\
      \ command);\nswitch (result) {\n    case COMMAND_OK:\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Help command processed successfully\");\n        break;\n    case COMMAND_FAILED:\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Help command failed due to insufficient permissions\"\
      );\n        break;\n    case COMMAND_ERROR:\n        sLog->outError(\"Help command\
      \ encountered an internal error\");\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot command handling system and should only be
    called from within the bot's command processing pipeline. The method assumes that
    all necessary context information has been properly initialized before invocation.
    It may perform asynchronous operations depending on the command type being executed.
  warnings: Ensure that the CommandContext and ChatCommand parameters are properly
    validated before calling this method to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
    This method does not handle memory management of the input parameters, so callers
    must ensure proper lifetime management of referenced objects.
