documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has the Thrash ability active.
  description: The HasThrash method determines whether a specific player, identified
    by their GUID, currently has the Thrash ability applied to them. This method is
    typically used in feral druid combat logic to track active debuffs and manage
    spell usage. The check is performed against an internal tracking structure that
    maintains information about active Thrash effects on players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player with the specified GUID has an active Thrash
    effect; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player Has Thrash
    code: "if (feralBleedTracker.HasThrash(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player is affected\
      \ by Thrash\n    // Apply appropriate logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an internal data structure that tracks active
    debuffs. The GUID parameter should refer to a valid player entity within the game
    world context.
