api:
  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: CompareBotPerformance
  signature: PerformanceComparison BotPerformanceAnalytics::CompareBotPerformance(uint32_t
    botGuid, uint64_t timeWindow)
documentation:
  brief: Compares performance metrics of a specified bot within a given time window.
  description: The CompareBotPerformance method evaluates and returns performance
    comparison data for a specific bot identified by its GUID. It analyzes various
    performance indicators such as response times, task completion rates, and resource
    utilization over the specified time window. This method is typically used in automated
    testing or monitoring systems to assess bot behavior and efficiency. The method
    requires a valid bot GUID and a meaningful time window value to produce accurate
    results.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose performance is being compared.
      Must be a valid, existing bot GUID in the system.
  - name: timeWindow
    description: Time window in milliseconds over which performance metrics are collected
      and compared. Should represent a reasonable duration for meaningful analysis.
  returns: PerformanceComparison object containing detailed metrics and comparison
    results between current and baseline performance of the specified bot.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Comparison
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      uint64_t timeWindow = 3600000; // 1 hour

      PerformanceComparison result = analytics.CompareBotPerformance(botGuid, timeWindow);

      // Process the comparison results'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Performance Analysis with Error Handling
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nuint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nuint64_t\
      \ timeWindow = 7200000; // 2 hours\ntry {\n    PerformanceComparison result\
      \ = analytics.CompareBotPerformance(botGuid, timeWindow);\n    if (result.IsValid())\
      \ {\n        // Process valid comparison data\n        std::cout << \"Performance\
      \ improved by: \" << result.GetImprovementPercentage() << \"%\";\n    }\n} catch\
      \ (const std::exception& e) {\n    std::cerr << \"Error comparing bot performance:\
      \ \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries or cache lookups depending on the
    implementation. Performance can be affected by large time windows or high-frequency
    data collection. The returned PerformanceComparison object should be checked for
    validity before accessing its members.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot GUID corresponds to an active bot in the system, otherwise
    results may be invalid or cause exceptions. Using excessively large time windows
    may lead to performance degradation and memory issues.
