  method: PropagateSuccessfulStrategies
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::PropagateSuccessfulStrategies()
documentation:
  brief: Propagates successful strategies from adapted behaviors to related AI components.
  description: The PropagateSuccessfulStrategies method is responsible for distributing
    the outcomes of behavior adaptations that have proven effective. This method ensures
    that successful strategy implementations are shared across relevant AI modules
    or subsystems within the TrinityCore framework, allowing for improved decision-making
    and adaptive behavior patterns. It typically operates as part of a larger behavioral
    adaptation system where strategies are evaluated, refined, and then disseminated
    to enhance overall AI performance.

    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n  \
      \  if (m_behaviorAdaptation.HasSuccessfulStrategies())\n    {\n        m_behaviorAdaptation.PropagateSuccessfulStrategies();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after behavior adaptations have been evaluated
    and confirmed as successful. It is typically invoked during AI update cycles or
    at specific intervals to ensure that beneficial strategies are propagated efficiently
    without causing performance bottlenecks.
