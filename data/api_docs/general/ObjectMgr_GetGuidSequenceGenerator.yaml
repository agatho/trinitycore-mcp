  signature: int & ObjectMgr::GetGuidSequenceGenerator(int high)
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the GUID sequence generator for the specified high
    guid type
  description: The GetGuidSequenceGenerator method retrieves a reference to an internal
    sequence generator used for generating unique identifiers (GUIDs) within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method is typically used to obtain a sequence counter that ensures
    globally unique identification of game objects, players, and other entities in
    the World of Warcraft emulation environment. The high parameter determines which
    type of GUID sequence to access, with different values corresponding to different
    object types such as players, creatures, game objects, etc. The returned reference
    allows direct modification of the sequence, enabling the system to maintain consistent
    and unique identification across all game entities.
  parameters:
  - name: high
    description: The high GUID type identifier that specifies which sequence generator
      to return. This value typically corresponds to specific object types in the
      game (e.g., players, creatures, game objects) and determines the range of GUIDs
      that will be generated.
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the current value of the GUID sequence
    generator for the specified high guid type. This reference can be used to increment
    or modify the sequence directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get and increment a GUID sequence
    code: 'int& playerGuidSeq = ObjectMgr::GetGuidSequenceGenerator(HIGHGUID_PLAYER);

      playerGuidSeq++;

      // playerGuidSeq now holds the next available player GUID'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the sequence generator to create a new creature GUID
    code: 'int& creatureGuidSeq = ObjectMgr::GetGuidSequenceGenerator(HIGHGUID_CREATURE);

      uint32 newCreatureGuid = (HIGHGUID_CREATURE << 16) | (++creatureGuidSeq);

      // newCreatureGuid is now a unique creature GUID'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal sequence counter, so modifying
    the returned value directly affects the global GUID generation. The method is
    thread-safe as it operates on per-type sequence generators that are typically
    managed by the game's object manager system.
  warnings: Direct modification of the returned reference can affect GUID generation
    for all subsequent objects created in that category. Ensure proper synchronization
    when accessing this method from multiple threads to avoid race conditions in GUID
    assignment.
