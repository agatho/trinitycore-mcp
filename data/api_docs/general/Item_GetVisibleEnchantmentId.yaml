documentation:
  brief: Returns the visible enchantment ID of the item, which is used to determine
    the visual appearance of enchantments on items.
  description: This method retrieves the visible enchantment ID associated with an
    item, which represents the ID of the enchantment that is currently visible to
    the player. The returned value corresponds to the enchantment ID shown in the
    game client for the item's visual appearance. This method is typically used in
    conjunction with player-specific data to determine how the item appears to a specific
    player. It does not return the actual enchantment ID of the item itself, but rather
    the ID that is visible to the player based on their own enchantment knowledge
    or visibility settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the visible enchantment ID of the item, which
    is typically a numeric identifier used in game client visual representations.
    This ID can be zero if no visible enchantment exists or if the item's enchantment
    is not visible to the player. The value corresponds to the ID shown in the game
    client for the item's visual appearance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 enchantmentId = item->GetVisibleEnchantmentId(player);\nif (enchantmentId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Item has visible enchantment\n    // Do something with the\
      \ enchantment ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with player-specific data to
    determine how the item appears to a specific player. It may return zero if no
    visible enchantment exists or if the item's enchantment is not visible to the
    player. The method does not directly return the actual enchantment ID of the item
    itself, but rather the ID that is visible to the player based on their own enchantment
    knowledge or visibility settings.
  warnings: This method should not be used in isolation without considering the player's
    enchantment knowledge or visibility settings. It may return zero if no visible
    enchantment exists or if the item's enchantment is not visible to the player.
    Be cautious when using this method for determining visual appearance of items.
