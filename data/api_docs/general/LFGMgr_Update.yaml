  method: Update
  signature: void LFGMgr::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the LFG manager's internal state and processes queued LFG operations.
  description: The Update method is a core component of the LFG (Looking For Group)
    system in TrinityCore, responsible for maintaining and processing the internal
    state of the LFG manager. It handles timed events such as queue timeouts, group
    matching logic, and player status updates. This method is typically called from
    the main game loop at regular intervals to ensure that LFG operations are processed
    in a timely manner. The method does not directly interact with players or groups
    but manages the underlying data structures and state transitions required for
    LFG functionality.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\n\
      \    sLFGMgr->Update(diff);\n    // ... other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly from the game's main update
    loop with a time delta (diff) parameter that represents milliseconds since last
    update. The implementation likely uses this delta for timing-based operations
    such as queue timeouts and status transitions. It's important to note that this
    method should not be called directly by other systems unless they are part of
    the core game loop infrastructure.
