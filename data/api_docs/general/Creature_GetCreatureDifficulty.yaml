  method: GetCreatureDifficulty
  signature: const CreatureDifficulty * Creature::GetCreatureDifficulty() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the creature difficulty data for the current creature instance.
  description: This method retrieves the CreatureDifficulty structure associated with
    the current creature, which contains information about the creature's difficulty
    level and related game mechanics. The returned pointer provides access to the
    creature's difficulty-specific properties such as health, mana, damage, and other
    combat-related attributes. This is essential for determining how the creature
    behaves in different difficulty modes (normal, heroic, etc.) within World of Warcraft's
    instance content.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the CreatureDifficulty structure which contains difficulty-specific
    data for this creature. Returns nullptr if no difficulty data is available or
    the creature has not been properly initialized with difficulty information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nconst CreatureDifficulty* diff = creature->GetCreatureDifficulty();\n\
      if (diff)\n{\n    // Use diff->health, diff->damage, etc.\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with creature's difficulty selection
    logic within instance content. The returned pointer may be null if the creature
    hasn't been initialized with proper difficulty data or if the creature is not
    part of an instance.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can return nullptr if the creature
    has not yet been assigned a difficulty level. Always check for null before accessing
    any fields in the returned structure to avoid access violations.
