  class: KitingManager
  method: GetAvailablePatterns
  signature: int KitingManager::GetAvailablePatterns(const KitingContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of available kiting patterns for the specified context.
  description: The GetAvailablePatterns method determines and returns the count of
    kiting movement patterns that are currently valid and available for use within
    the provided kiting context. This method is typically used by AI systems or movement
    controllers to assess how many distinct kiting behaviors can be executed based
    on current game state, target position, and environmental constraints. The returned
    value represents a numeric identifier indicating the total number of applicable
    kiting patterns, which may influence decision-making in combat or movement logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of available kiting patterns for the
    given context. A return value of zero indicates no valid patterns are currently
    available, while positive values indicate the count of usable patterns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "KitingContext context;\nint patternCount = kitingManager.GetAvailablePatterns(context);\n\
      if (patternCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with selecting a kiting pattern\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks such as evaluating target distance,
    terrain conditions, and player orientation to determine valid kiting patterns.
    It may be called frequently during AI decision-making loops, so performance should
    be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
