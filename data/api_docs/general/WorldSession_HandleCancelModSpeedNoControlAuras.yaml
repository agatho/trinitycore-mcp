    & cancelModSpeedNoControlAuras)
documentation:
  brief: Cancels aura effects that modify player movement speed without control.
  description: The HandleCancelModSpeedNoControlAuras method processes incoming client
    packets to remove specific auras that alter a player's movement speed. These auras
    typically represent abilities or effects that change how fast the player moves,
    such as those from certain spells or items, but are not under direct player control.
    The method ensures that any active speed-modifying auras without control are properly
    removed from the player's state. This is part of the game's anti-cheat and gameplay
    mechanics to maintain proper movement behavior for players.
  parameters:
  - name: cancelModSpeedNoControlAuras
    description: The packet containing data related to the cancellation request for
      speed-modifying auras that are not under player control.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleCancelModSpeedNoControlAuras(WorldPackets::Spells::CancelModSpeedNoControlAuras&\
      \ cancelModSpeedNoControlAuras)\n{\n    // Implementation removes applicable\
      \ auras\n    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n    if (player)\n    {\n       \
      \ player->RemoveAuraType(SPELL_AURA_MOD_SPEED_NO_CONTROL);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the packet handling system when
    a client sends a request to cancel specific movement speed modifiers. It interacts
    with the player's aura system and should be called only when appropriate, such
    as during specific spell or ability interactions.
