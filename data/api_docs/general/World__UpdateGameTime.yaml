  method: _UpdateGameTime
  signature: void World::_UpdateGameTime()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal game time tracking system to reflect the current real-world
    time.
  description: The _UpdateGameTime method is responsible for maintaining the world's
    internal time state by synchronizing it with the actual system clock. This method
    is typically called periodically by the game loop to ensure that in-game time
    progresses correctly according to real-time intervals. It updates various time-related
    systems such as server time, game tick timing, and ensures consistency across
    all connected clients. The method does not directly affect gameplay mechanics
    but is crucial for maintaining accurate time-based events, such as sun/moon cycles,
    server time displays, and time-sensitive quest conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    while (running)\n    {\n        // ... other game\
      \ logic ...\n        sWorld->_UpdateGameTime();\n        // ... more game logic\
      \ ...\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from the main game thread to maintain thread
    safety. It's typically invoked automatically by the core game loop and shouldn't
    require manual calls in most scenarios. The internal time tracking may be affected
    by system clock adjustments or server load.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the main game thread can lead to race conditions
    and inconsistent time states. Avoid manual invocation unless you're certain about
    the implications for time synchronization across the entire world instance.
