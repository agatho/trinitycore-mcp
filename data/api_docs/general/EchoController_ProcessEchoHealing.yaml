  brief: Processes echo healing effects for affected targets in the current environment
  description: The ProcessEchoHealing method handles the application and management
    of echo healing mechanics within the TrinityCore framework. This method iterates
    through all applicable targets that are currently affected by echo healing effects,
    calculates the appropriate healing amounts based on the source spell's properties
    and target conditions, and applies the healing to each eligible unit. The method
    ensures proper handling of healing over time effects, periodic tick calculations,
    and maintains synchronization with the game's combat log system. It is typically
    invoked during the update cycle of affected units or when specific triggering
    conditions are met.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void CombatSystem::Update()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n   \
      \ echoController.ProcessEchoHealing();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Trigger for Testing
    code: "void TestEchoHealing()\n{\n    // Simulate manual triggering of echo healing\n\
      \    EchoController* controller = sObjectAccessor->GetEchoController();\n  \
      \  if (controller)\n    {\n        controller->ProcessEchoHealing();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of the World of Warcraft's healing
    system and relies on proper initialization of echo healing effects. It should
    only be called when there are active echo healing effects present in the current
    environment to avoid unnecessary processing overhead. The method handles both
    single-target and area-of-effect echo healing scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initialized echo healing effects
    may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all affected units have
    valid echo healing state information before invoking this method. Avoid calling
    this method from multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization
    mechanisms.
