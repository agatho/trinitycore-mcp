  class: QuestHub
  method: ContainsPosition
  signature: bool QuestHub::ContainsPosition(const int & pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is contained within the quest hub's boundaries.
  description: The ContainsPosition method determines whether a specified position
    coordinate falls within the defined area of the QuestHub. This functionality is
    typically used to verify if a player or object is located inside a specific quest
    zone or trigger area. The method performs a boundary check against internal quest
    hub coordinates, returning true if the position is within range and false otherwise.
    This is essential for quest progression systems where player location affects
    quest state or triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position coordinate to check against the quest hub boundaries.
      This is typically an integer representing a coordinate value in the game world
      space.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is within the quest hub's defined
    boundaries, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Check
    code: "if (questHub.ContainsPosition(playerPosition)) {\n    // Player is inside\
      \ the quest hub area\n    HandleQuestTrigger();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Quest State Management
    code: "bool isInHub = questHub.ContainsPosition(currentPlayerPos);\nif (isInHub\
      \ && !questCompleted) {\n    // Activate quest objectives\n    quest->ActivateObjectives();\n\
      } else if (!isInHub && questCompleted) {\n    // Reset or deactivate quest\n\
      \    quest->ResetQuest();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal coordinate systems and may involve spatial
    partitioning for performance. It's recommended to cache position checks when dealing
    with frequent queries. The exact boundary calculation (inclusive/exclusive) should
    be verified based on implementation details.
  warnings: Ensure that the position parameter represents a valid coordinate within
    the expected range, as invalid coordinates might lead to unexpected behavior or
    performance degradation. This method may not handle edge cases involving complex
    multi-dimensional boundaries.
