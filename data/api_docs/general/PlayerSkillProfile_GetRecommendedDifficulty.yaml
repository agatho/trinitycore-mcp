  method: GetRecommendedDifficulty
  signature: float PlayerSkillProfile::GetRecommendedDifficulty() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the recommended difficulty level for the player based
    on their skill profile.
  description: The GetRecommendedDifficulty method computes a float value representing
    the optimal difficulty level that should be offered to the player. This calculation
    takes into account various factors such as the player's current skill levels,
    progression history, and game balance parameters. The returned value is typically
    used by the game engine to dynamically adjust quest difficulties, dungeon challenges,
    or other gameplay elements to maintain an engaging experience without being overly
    frustrating or trivial. The method does not modify any internal state and is purely
    a read-only calculation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the recommended difficulty level. This value
    typically ranges between 0.0 (easiest) and 1.0 (hardest), though exact bounds
    may vary based on game implementation. Values outside this range may indicate
    special cases or error conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float difficulty = player->GetSkillProfile()->GetRecommendedDifficulty();\n\
      // Use the difficulty value to adjust quest difficulty\nif (difficulty > 0.7f)\n\
      {\n    // Apply harder quest modifiers\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Difficulty Scaling
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* profile = player->GetSkillProfile();

      float recommended = profile->GetRecommendedDifficulty();

      uint32 scaledDifficulty = static_cast<uint32>(recommended * 100);

      // Use scaledDifficulty for dungeon difficulty selection

      player->SetDungeonDifficulty(scaledDifficulty);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations based on the player's current skill profile
    and may involve multiple internal computations. It is recommended to cache the
    result if the value is used multiple times within a single game tick or frame
    to avoid redundant calculations. The calculation may be influenced by temporary
    buffs, achievements, or other transient player state elements.
  warnings: The returned difficulty value should not be directly used for UI display
    without proper normalization or formatting, as it may contain values outside the
    expected [0.0, 1.0] range in edge cases. Additionally, this method might not account
    for real-time changes in player performance during active gameplay sessions.
