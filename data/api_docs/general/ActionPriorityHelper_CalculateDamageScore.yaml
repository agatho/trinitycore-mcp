    spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a damage score for a target based on spell effectiveness and target
    attributes
  description: The CalculateDamageScore method evaluates the potential damage output
    of a spell against a specified target. It considers various factors such as spell
    power, target resistance, damage type, and target health to determine a normalized
    score value. This score is used by AI decision-making systems to prioritize spell
    casting based on expected damage output. The method performs calculations using
    internal game mechanics and target state information to provide an objective measure
    of spell effectiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object for which damage score is calculated.
      Must point to a valid GameObject or Unit instance.
  - name: spellId
    description: Identifier of the spell being evaluated. Must correspond to a valid
      spell entry in the game database.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated damage score. Higher
    values indicate more effective damage potential. Values typically range from 0.0
    (no damage) to 1.0 (maximum possible damage) but may exceed 1.0 for exceptionally
    strong spells.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Damage Score Calculation
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nuint32 spellId = 12345;\nfloat score\
      \ = ActionPriorityHelper::CalculateDamageScore((int*)target, spellId);\nif (score\
      \ > 0.8f) {\n    // Cast high-damage spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making with Damage Score
    code: "float bestScore = 0.0f;\nuint32 bestSpell = 0;\nfor (auto& spell : availableSpells)\
      \ {\n    float score = ActionPriorityHelper::CalculateDamageScore((int*)target,\
      \ spell.id);\n    if (score > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = score;\n   \
      \     bestSpell = spell.id;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestSpell based on calculated\
      \ damage score"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI decision-making systems for determining
    optimal spell selection. The calculation takes into account target resistance,
    spell power scaling, and various combat modifiers. Performance impact is minimal
    as it uses cached target state information when available.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent undefined behavior. The spellId must be validated against existing spells
    in the database to avoid invalid calculations.
