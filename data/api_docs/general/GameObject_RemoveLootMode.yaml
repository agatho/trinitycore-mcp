  class: GameObject
  method: RemoveLootMode
  signature: void GameObject::RemoveLootMode(uint16 lootMode)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific loot mode from the GameObject's loot list.
  description: This method removes a specified loot mode from the GameObject's loot
    list, effectively disabling that particular loot mode for the object. It is used
    to control which loot modes are active during loot generation, allowing developers
    to fine-tune the loot behavior of game objects. The method operates on the internal
    loot system and affects how loot is distributed when players interact with the
    GameObject.
  parameters:
  - name: lootMode
    description: The loot mode to be removed from the GameObject's loot list. This
      represents a specific loot mode (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) that corresponds to
      different loot types or conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Loot Mode Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->RemoveLootMode(1);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related methods
    to manage the complete loot system of a GameObject. It should be called before
    any loot generation occurs to ensure proper behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect loot distribution or
    missing loot items, especially if used without understanding the full context
    of loot modes and their interplay with other game systems.
