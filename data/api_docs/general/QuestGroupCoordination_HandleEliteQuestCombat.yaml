documentation:
  brief: Handles combat logic for elite quest targets within a group context
  description: The HandleEliteQuestCombat method manages the behavior and interactions
    when group members engage with elite quest targets. This method is responsible
    for coordinating combat events, updating quest progress, and ensuring proper group
    dynamics during elite quest encounters. It typically processes target destruction,
    rewards distribution, and quest state updates based on group participation. The
    method assumes that the group has already been validated and that the elite target
    is properly initialized within the quest system.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group engaged
      in the elite quest combat. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: eliteTarget
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the elite quest target identifier
      or health value. This parameter is modified during combat processing to reflect
      changes in target state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Elite Quest Combat Handling
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = ...; // Assume valid group

      int targetId = 12345;

      questCoordination->HandleEliteQuestCombat(playerGroup, &targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Elite Quest Combat with Group Validation
    code: "if (playerGroup && playerGroup->GetMembersCount() > 0)\n{\n    int eliteTarget\
      \ = GetEliteQuestTarget();\n    questCoordination->HandleEliteQuestCombat(playerGroup,\
      \ &eliteTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when an elite quest is active and properly
    initialized. The eliteTarget parameter may be modified during execution to reflect
    combat progress or completion status. Ensure that the group pointer is valid before
    calling this method to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. The eliteTarget parameter must point to a valid integer; passing an
    invalid memory location can cause crashes or data corruption.
