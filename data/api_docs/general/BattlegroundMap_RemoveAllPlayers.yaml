  brief: Removes all players from the battleground map
  description: The RemoveAllPlayers method removes all currently active players from
    the battleground map, effectively clearing the map of all participants. This method
    is typically invoked during battleground cleanup operations, such as when a battleground
    ends or is reset. It ensures that player references are properly cleared and any
    associated resources are released. The operation affects all players within the
    battleground's scope and should only be called when it's safe to remove all players
    from the map.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground Cleanup
    code: "BattlegroundMap* bgMap = sObjectAccessor->GetMap(1234);\nif (bgMap)\n{\n\
      \    bgMap->RemoveAllPlayers();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through all players currently on the battleground
    map and removes them from the map's player list. It may also trigger cleanup routines
    for each player's battleground data. The operation is typically performed during
    battleground lifecycle events such as ending or resetting.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are still participating in active gameplay
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all battleground activities
    have been properly concluded before invoking this method.
