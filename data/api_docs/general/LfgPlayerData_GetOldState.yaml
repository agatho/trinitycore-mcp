documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the previous LFG state of the player
  description: The GetOldState method returns the last known LfgState of the player
    before the current state was set. This is used internally by the LFG (Looking
    for Group) system to track state transitions and maintain consistency during group
    matching processes. The returned state represents what the player's LFG status
    was prior to any recent changes, allowing the system to properly handle state
    rollbacks or revert operations if needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an LfgState enum value representing the player's previous LFG state.
    Possible values include LFG_STATE_NONE, LFG_STATE_ROLECHECK, LFG_STATE_JOIN, LFG_STATE_PROPOSAL,
    LFG_STATE_SUMMON, LFG_STATE_TELEPORT, LFG_STATE_FINISHED, and LFG_STATE_INVALID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve previous LFG state for debugging
    code: "LfgState oldState = playerData->GetOldState();\nif (oldState != LFG_STATE_NONE)\n\
      {\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"lfg\", \"Player's previous LFG state was: {}\", oldState);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during LFG state transition handling. The
    old state value is maintained by the LfgPlayerData class internally and updated
    whenever a new LFG state is assigned to the player.
