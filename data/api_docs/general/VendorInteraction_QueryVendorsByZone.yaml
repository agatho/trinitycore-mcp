  class: VendorInteraction
  method: QueryVendorsByZone
  signature: int VendorInteraction::QueryVendorsByZone(uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Queries and retrieves vendor information for a specified zone ID.
  description: The QueryVendorsByZone method fetches all vendor entries associated
    with a given zone identifier. This function is typically used within the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to retrieve NPC vendors that operate
    within a specific geographical area or zone. It allows for dynamic vendor listings
    based on player location or zone-based filtering. The method may internally query
    the database or cached vendor data structures to compile a list of valid vendors
    for the specified zone.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of vendors found in the specified
    zone. A return value of zero indicates no vendors were located, while a positive
    integer indicates the count of vendors retrieved.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Vendor Count for a Specific Zone
    code: "uint32 zoneId = 141; // Elwynn Forest\nint vendorCount = vendorInteraction->QueryVendorsByZone(zoneId);\n\
      if (vendorCount > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << vendorCount << \" vendors\
      \ in Elwynn Forest.\" << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"No vendors\
      \ found in Elwynn Forest.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal vendor caches or database queries.
    It is recommended to cache results where possible to reduce repeated database
    lookups. The zone ID must be valid and correspond to an existing zone in the game
    world.
  warnings: Ensure that the zoneId parameter corresponds to a valid zone in the game
    world; invalid IDs may lead to unexpected behavior or no results. This method
    should not be called excessively without caching, as it may impact performance.
