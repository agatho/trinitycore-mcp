  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: SelectByPriority
  signature: const LevelBracket * BotLevelDistribution::SelectByPriority(const int
    & brackets) const
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the appropriate level bracket based on priority rules
    from the bot's level distribution.
  description: The SelectByPriority method determines which LevelBracket should be
    selected for a bot based on internal priority logic. This method is typically
    used in the context of bot behavior or AI decision-making, where bots need to
    select appropriate level brackets for activities such as questing, combat, or
    loot distribution. The selection process considers various factors like bot level,
    distribution weights, and game mechanics. It ensures that bots operate within
    appropriate level ranges for their current state and environment. This method
    does not modify any internal state and is purely a lookup operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the selected LevelBracket object that matches the priority
    criteria. Returns nullptr if no valid bracket can be determined or if the distribution
    is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SelectByPriority
    code: "const LevelBracket* bracket = botLevelDistribution.SelectByPriority(5);\n\
      if (bracket != nullptr) {\n    std::cout << \"Selected bracket: \" << bracket->GetMinLevel()\
      \ << \" - \" << bracket->GetMaxLevel() << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"No valid bracket found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not have side effects.
    It relies on the internal state of BotLevelDistribution, which must be properly
    initialized before calling this method. The priority logic may involve complex
    calculations or lookups based on game rules and configurations.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotLevelDistribution object is fully initialized before
    calling SelectByPriority, as an uninitialized or corrupted distribution could
    lead to unexpected behavior or null returns. Avoid calling this method in performance-critical
    sections without considering potential overhead from internal logic.
