  class: PhasingHandler
  method: OnMapChange
  signature: void PhasingHandler::OnMapChange(WorldObject * object)
documentation:
  brief: Handles phase changes when a WorldObject moves between different maps or
    zones in the game world.
  description: The OnMapChange method is invoked by the PhasingHandler to manage and
    update the phasing state of a WorldObject when it transitions between different
    maps or zones. This ensures that the object's visibility, interaction, and event
    triggers are properly adjusted according to the new map's phase settings. The
    method typically updates the object's phase information and may trigger necessary
    client-side updates or server-side logic adjustments related to phasing mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom handler
    code: "class MyMapChangeHandler : public PhasingHandler {\npublic:\n    void OnMapChange(WorldObject*\
      \ object) override {\n        // Custom logic before calling base implementation\n\
      \        PhasingHandler::OnMapChange(object);\n        // Additional phase-related\
      \ operations\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    map transitions. Developers should ensure that any custom phasing logic does not
    interfere with core phasing systems. The method may be invoked multiple times
    during a single movement operation if the object crosses multiple phase boundaries.
  warnings: Avoid modifying the WorldObject's phase directly within this method unless
    necessary, as it might cause inconsistencies in the phasing system. Ensure that
    any custom logic doesn't introduce performance bottlenecks or race conditions
    during map transitions.
