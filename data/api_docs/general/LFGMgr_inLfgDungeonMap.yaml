  signature: bool LFGMgr::inLfgDungeonMap(int guid, uint32 map, Difficulty difficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is currently inside a LFG dungeon map.
  description: The inLfgDungeonMap method determines whether a specific player, identified
    by their GUID, is currently located within a LFG (Looking For Group) dungeon map.
    This function is typically used to verify the player's location status during
    group matching, queue management, or dungeon entry validation processes. It evaluates
    the player's current map and difficulty context to return an accurate boolean
    result indicating their presence in a valid LFG dungeon environment.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check. This should
      be a valid player GUID obtained from the game's entity management system.
  - name: map
    description: The map ID representing the dungeon or instance the player is potentially
      in. This corresponds to the map entry in the game's database.
  - name: difficulty
    description: The difficulty level of the dungeon (normal, heroic, mythic, etc.).
      This helps verify that the player is in the correct difficulty variant of the
      dungeon.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is currently inside a LFG dungeon
    map matching the provided map ID and difficulty; otherwise returns false. The
    method will return false if the player is not in any active LFG dungeon or if
    the map/difficulty does not match.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if player is in a specific LFG dungeon
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nbool isInDungeon =\
      \ sLFGMgr->inLfgDungeonMap(playerGuid, 1234, DIFFICULTY_NORMAL);\nif (isInDungeon)\n\
      {\n    // Player is in the specified LFG dungeon\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple difficulty checks
    code: "uint32 playerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nbool isInHeroicDungeon\
      \ = sLFGMgr->inLfgDungeonMap(playerGuid, 1234, DIFFICULTY_HEROIC);\nbool isInMythicDungeon\
      \ = sLFGMgr->inLfgDungeonMap(playerGuid, 1234, DIFFICULTY_MYTHIC);\nif (isInHeroicDungeon\
      \ || isInMythicDungeon)\n{\n    // Player is in a heroic or mythic version of\
      \ the dungeon\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal LFG state tracking and should only be called
    when the player's location and LFG status are known to be valid. The method may
    not return accurate results if called before the player has fully entered the
    dungeon or after they have left it. It is recommended to use this function in
    conjunction with other LFG state checks for robust validation.
  warnings: Do not call this method on players who are not currently in a group or
    during LFG queue transitions, as it may return unexpected results due to incomplete
    state updates. Also ensure that the map and difficulty parameters match exactly
    what is expected by the LFG system to avoid false negatives.
