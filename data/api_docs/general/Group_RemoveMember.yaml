  class: Group
  method: RemoveMember
  signature: bool Group::RemoveMember(int guid, int method, int kicker, const char
    * reason)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a member from the group with specified removal method, kicker, and
    optional reason.
  description: The RemoveMember method removes a player from a group (raid or party)
    based on the provided GUID. It supports different removal methods such as kicking,
    leaving, or being disbanded. The method takes into account the kicker's identity
    and an optional reason for the removal. This function is typically used internally
    by the TrinityCore server when handling group management operations like player
    kicks or automatic group disbanding due to inactivity.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from the
      group. Must correspond to a valid player in the group.
  - name: method
    description: 'The method used for removal. Common values include: 0 = kicked,
      1 = left, 2 = disband, 3 = die. Determines how the removal is processed and
      communicated.'
  - name: kicker
    description: The GUID of the player who initiated the removal (e.g., the one who
      issued the kick command). Set to 0 if not applicable or unknown.
  - name: reason
    description: Optional reason string explaining why the member was removed. Can
      be NULL or empty for no specific reason.
  returns: Returns true if the member was successfully removed from the group, false
    otherwise. Failure may occur if the player is not found in the group or if invalid
    parameters are provided.
  examples:
  - title: Remove a player by GUID with kick method
    code: "Group* group = ...; // Assume valid group pointer\nbool success = group->RemoveMember(123456,\
      \ 0, 789012, \"Player was kicked for violating rules\");\nif (success) {\n \
      \   // Player removed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove a player with no reason provided
    code: "Group* group = ...;\nbool success = group->RemoveMember(123456, 1, 0, NULL);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Player left the group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal group state and sends appropriate packets to
    all remaining members. It should only be called when the caller has proper permissions
    to manage the group. The method does not validate that the GUID corresponds to
    an actual online player; it assumes the caller ensures validity.
  warnings: Calling this function without proper checks may lead to inconsistent group
    state or crashes. Always verify that the target player exists in the group before
    calling RemoveMember. Using invalid method values can cause unexpected behavior
    during packet handling and communication with clients.
