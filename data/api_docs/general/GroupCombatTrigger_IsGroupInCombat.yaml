  method: IsGroupInCombat
  signature: bool GroupCombatTrigger::IsGroupInCombat(Group * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if any member of the specified group is currently in combat.
  description: The IsGroupInCombat method determines whether at least one player or
    creature within the provided group has entered combat status. This utility function
    is commonly used in AI scripts and quest triggers to assess group engagement with
    enemies. The method evaluates all group members, including both players and pets,
    to determine if any are actively fighting. It returns true immediately upon finding
    the first combatant, making it efficient for real-time game state checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if any member of the group is in combat; otherwise returns
    false. A group with no members or all members out of combat will return false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check group combat status
    code: "if (groupCombatTrigger->IsGroupInCombat(playerGroup))\n{\n    // Group\
      \ is in combat, handle accordingly\n    sLog->outString(\"Group is engaged in\
      \ combat!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a combat trigger condition
    code: "class MyCombatTrigger : public GroupCombatTrigger\n{\npublic:\n    bool\
      \ CheckCombatStatus(Group* group)\n    {\n        if (IsGroupInCombat(group))\n\
      \        {\n            // Proceed with combat-related logic\n            return\
      \ true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a fast check by iterating through group members and
    checking their combat state. It's designed to be lightweight for frequent calls
    in AI systems. The implementation considers both player and creature group members,
    including summoned pets and guardians.
  warnings: Ensure the group pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    crashes. The method does not account for temporary combat states or delayed combat
    entry; it reflects the current combat status of group members.
