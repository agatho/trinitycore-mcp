  signature: DifficultySettings AdaptiveDifficulty::InterpolateDifficulty(const DifficultySettings
    & easy, const DifficultySettings & hard, float t) const
documentation:
  brief: Interpolates between two difficulty settings based on a given factor.
  description: The InterpolateDifficulty method performs linear interpolation between
    two DifficultySettings objects, using a factor 't' to determine the weighted average
    of their properties. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's adaptive difficulty
    system to smoothly transition between easy and hard difficulty levels. The method
    takes two difficulty settings (easy and hard) and a interpolation factor t, where
    t=0 returns the easy setting, t=1 returns the hard setting, and values in between
    return interpolated values. The interpolation is applied to numerical properties
    such as health, damage, experience rewards, and other game mechanics that scale
    with difficulty.
  parameters:
  - name: easy
    description: The base difficulty settings representing the easier difficulty level.
  - name: hard
    description: The target difficulty settings representing the harder difficulty
      level.
  - name: t
    description: Interpolation factor between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 returns easy
      settings and 1.0 returns hard settings.
  returns: A new DifficultySettings object containing interpolated values between
    the easy and hard difficulty settings based on the interpolation factor t.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interpolation
    code: 'DifficultySettings easy = GetEasyDifficulty();

      DifficultySettings hard = GetHardDifficulty();

      float t = 0.5f; // Midpoint

      DifficultySettings interpolated = adaptiveDifficulty.InterpolateDifficulty(easy,
      hard, t);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adaptive Difficulty Scaling
    code: 'DifficultySettings baseEasy = GetBaseEasySettings();

      DifficultySettings baseHard = GetBaseHardSettings();

      float difficultyFactor = CalculatePlayerProgress(); // 0.0 to 1.0

      DifficultySettings currentSettings = adaptiveDifficulty.InterpolateDifficulty(baseEasy,
      baseHard, difficultyFactor);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that DifficultySettings contains numeric properties that
    can be linearly interpolated. The implementation should handle edge cases where
    t < 0 or t > 1 gracefully, though typically these values are clamped to [0,1].
    The method is designed to be efficient and suitable for real-time difficulty adjustment
    during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the input DifficultySettings objects are properly initialized
    before calling this method. Improperly initialized settings may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect interpolation results. Avoid using extremely large values
    for t as they may cause overflow issues in calculations.
