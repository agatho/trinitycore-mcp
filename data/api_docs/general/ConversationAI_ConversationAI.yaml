  brief: Moves a ConversationAI object to another ConversationAI object
  description: The ConversationAI move constructor transfers ownership of resources
    from one ConversationAI instance to another. This is a standard C++ move semantics
    implementation that efficiently reassigns internal data members without deep copying.
    The source object becomes invalid after the move operation and should not be used.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this constructor supports efficient
    resource management when creating or assigning ConversationAI objects during NPC
    conversation handling.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another ConversationAI object whose resources
      will be moved to this instance
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic move construction
    code: 'ConversationAI sourceAI;

      // ... initialize sourceAI ...

      ConversationAI newAI = std::move(sourceAI); // Move constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in function parameter
    code: "void ProcessConversation(ConversationAI&& conversation) {\n    ConversationAI\
      \ localAI = std::move(conversation);\n    // Use localAI for conversation handling\n\
      }\n// Usage:\nConversationAI ai;\nProcessConversation(std::move(ai));"
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor is automatically generated by the compiler when no
    custom destructor, copy constructor, or assignment operator is defined. It's important
    to note that after a move operation, the source object should not be accessed
    as its state becomes undefined. The implementation assumes proper resource management
    of internal AI data structures.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Developers must ensure that no further operations are performed on the
    source object after moving it. This is particularly important when dealing with
    AI objects that manage complex conversation states and dialogue trees.
