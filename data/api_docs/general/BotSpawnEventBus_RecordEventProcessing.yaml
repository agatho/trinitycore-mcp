  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: RecordEventProcessing
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::RecordEventProcessing(uint64 processingTimeUs)
documentation:
  brief: Records the processing time of a bot spawn event for performance monitoring
    and analytics.
  description: The RecordEventProcessing method logs the duration in microseconds
    that a bot spawn event took to process. This method is typically used within the
    BotSpawnEventBus class to track performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, or
    analyze system efficiency during bot spawning operations. It allows developers
    to monitor how long various stages of the bot creation pipeline take, which can
    be crucial for maintaining optimal server performance and responsiveness. The
    recorded time is likely stored internally for statistical purposes or may be forwarded
    to an external monitoring system.
  parameters:
  - name: processingTimeUs
    description: The processing time of the bot spawn event in microseconds (us).
      This value represents the elapsed time from when the event began until it was
      fully processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus eventBus;

      uint64 processingTime = 1500; // 1.5 milliseconds

      eventBus.RecordEventProcessing(processingTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Timing Measurement
    code: '#include <chrono>

      BotSpawnEventBus eventBus;

      auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // ... bot spawning logic here ...

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      uint64 processingTimeUs = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start).count();

      eventBus.RecordEventProcessing(processingTimeUs);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger event-driven system for managing bot
    spawns in TrinityCore. The recorded processing times may be aggregated over time
    to calculate average, maximum, or minimum values for performance analysis. It's
    recommended that this method be called after all relevant processing steps are
    complete to ensure accurate timing.
  warnings: Ensure that the input value for processingTimeUs accurately reflects the
    actual processing duration; incorrect values will skew performance metrics. This
    method should not be called with negative values as it may indicate a bug in the
    timing logic or system clock issues.
