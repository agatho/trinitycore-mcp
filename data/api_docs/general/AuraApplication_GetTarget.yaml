  signature: Unit * AuraApplication::GetTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the target unit that the aura application is attached to.
  description: The GetTarget method retrieves a pointer to the Unit object that serves
    as the target of this AuraApplication. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, an
    AuraApplication represents a specific instance of an aura applied to a particular
    unit. This method allows access to the unit that is currently affected by the
    aura, which can be useful for various game mechanics such as checking aura properties,
    modifying aura behavior, or determining the target for aura-related effects. The
    returned pointer is valid only while the target unit exists and remains in the
    world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object that is the target of this aura application.
    Returns nullptr if the target has been destroyed or is no longer valid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check aura target
    code: "AuraApplication* app = ...; // Assume app is a valid AuraApplication pointer\n\
      Unit* target = app->GetTarget();\nif (target)\n{\n    // Perform operations\
      \ on the target unit\n    sLog->outString(\"Aura applied to unit: %u\", target->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using target in aura effect handling
    code: "void HandleAuraEffect(AuraApplication* app, AuraEffectType type)\n{\n \
      \   Unit* target = app->GetTarget();\n    if (!target || !target->IsAlive())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Use the target for calculations or effects\n\
      \    target->ModifyHealth(-100); // Example damage effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Unit pointer should be checked for null before use, as the target
    may have been removed from the world or destroyed. This method is commonly used
    in aura application callbacks and effect handlers to determine which unit is currently
    affected by a specific aura instance.
  warnings: Be cautious when storing the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the
    AuraApplication or its target. If the target unit is removed from the world or
    destroyed, the pointer becomes invalid and accessing it will result in undefined
    behavior.
