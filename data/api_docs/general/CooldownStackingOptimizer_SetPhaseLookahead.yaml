  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: SetPhaseLookahead
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::SetPhaseLookahead(uint32 ms)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the phase lookahead duration for cooldown stacking optimization calculations.
  description: The SetPhaseLookahead method configures the time window (in milliseconds)
    that the CooldownStackingOptimizer uses to anticipate and plan cooldown usage
    during different phases of combat or gameplay. This setting affects how the optimizer
    evaluates when to activate abilities based on upcoming cooldowns, ensuring optimal
    resource management and ability timing. The lookahead duration influences decision-making
    for multi-phase scenarios where abilities may have overlapping cooldowns or need
    to be scheduled in advance. This method should be called before initiating cooldown
    optimization calculations to ensure accurate behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: ms
    description: The duration in milliseconds to look ahead when calculating cooldown
      phases. Valid values are typically positive integers representing time intervals.
      Larger values may increase computational overhead but provide more accurate
      predictions for complex scenarios.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetPhaseLookahead(5000); // Set lookahead to 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting for Different Combat Styles
    code: "if (player->GetMap()->IsRaid()) {\n    optimizer.SetPhaseLookahead(10000);\
      \ // Longer lookahead for raid encounters\n} else {\n    optimizer.SetPhaseLookahead(3000);\
      \  // Shorter lookahead for dungeons\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal timing calculations of the cooldown
    optimizer. Changes to the lookahead value should be made before starting optimization
    cycles, as modifying it mid-calculation may lead to inconsistent results. The
    optimal lookahead duration depends on the complexity of abilities being optimized
    and the expected duration of combat phases.
  warnings: Setting an excessively large lookahead value may cause performance degradation
    due to increased computational overhead. Ensure that the specified time interval
    aligns with realistic gameplay scenarios to avoid unnecessary processing.
