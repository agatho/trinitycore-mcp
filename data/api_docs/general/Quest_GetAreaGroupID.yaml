  class: Quest
  method: GetAreaGroupID
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetAreaGroupID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the area group ID associated with the quest.
  description: The GetAreaGroupID method retrieves the area group identifier that
    is linked to a specific quest. This identifier typically corresponds to the area
    or zone where the quest is available or becomes active. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, this value helps determine which area group the quest belongs
    to, influencing quest availability and progression within the game world. The
    method is commonly used for filtering quests based on player location or area
    group, and can be essential for quest-related logic in game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the area group ID associated with the quest.
    This value typically corresponds to an area group identifier that defines where
    the quest is available or becomes active within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 areaGroupId = quest->GetAreaGroupID();\nif (areaGroupId > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Process quest based on area group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and typically used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods to determine quest eligibility or progression.
    It should be noted that this value may not always directly correspond to a player's
    current zone, but rather to the area group where the quest originates.
  warnings: The returned area group ID might not always match the actual player zone,
    especially in cases where quests are available across multiple zones or when using
    quest scripts. Be cautious when relying on this value for zone-based logic, as
    it may lead to incorrect assumptions about quest availability.
