  signature: void MonkAI::ManageTacticalFormSwitching()
documentation:
  brief: Manages switching between tactical forms for the Monk AI based on combat
    conditions and resource availability.
  description: The ManageTacticalFormSwitching method controls the logic for switching
    between different tactical forms (such as Tiger Stance, Serpent Stance, or Crane
    Stance) in the Monk AI. This method evaluates current combat state, available
    resources like energy or chi, and situational factors to determine when and how
    to transition between stances. It ensures that the Monk AI uses the most effective
    form for the given scenario, optimizing damage output, survivability, or utility.
    The method is typically called during the AI's update cycle to make real-time
    tactical decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void DummyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic\n    if (me->GetVictim())\n\
      \        monkAI->ManageTacticalFormSwitching();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with the Monk's stance system and resource
    management. It may depend on internal state tracking of the AI's current form,
    target health, and available abilities. Performance is generally low as it only
    executes during AI update cycles.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI has a valid target before calling this method, as switching
    forms without a clear tactical benefit could lead to suboptimal gameplay behavior.
    Also, avoid calling this method too frequently in rapid succession, as it may
    interfere with form transition animations or cooldowns.
