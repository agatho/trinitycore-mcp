  class: Player
  method: GetQuestSlotObjectiveFlag
  signature: bool Player::GetQuestSlotObjectiveFlag(uint16 slot, int8 objectiveIndex)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns whether a specific quest objective flag is set in the player's quest
    log.
  description: This method checks if a particular quest objective flag is enabled
    for a given quest slot and objective index. It is used to determine the status
    of quest objectives within the player's quest log, which can be important for
    game mechanics such as quest completion tracking or conditional quest rewards.
    The method operates on the player's internal quest data structure, specifically
    targeting the objective flags associated with a quest slot. This function is typically
    used in conjunction with other quest-related methods to validate quest progress
    and ensure proper quest handling.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot index (0-25) where the quest is stored, representing
      the position in the player's quest log.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The objective index within the quest slot, typically ranging from
      0 to 4, indicating which specific objective within a quest to check.
  returns: Returns true if the specified objective flag is set, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the quest objective has been completed or marked as complete
    in the player's quest log.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "bool flag = player->GetQuestSlotObjectiveFlag(0, 0);\nif (flag)\n{\n  \
      \  // Quest objective is complete\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest system and should be used carefully
    when dealing with quest progression. It may not be directly exposed to external
    APIs but is essential for internal game logic handling.
  warnings: This method should only be called within valid quest slot ranges, as invalid
    indices can cause undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that the player's
    quest data is properly initialized and accessible.
