  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: GetBattlegroundType
  signature: BGType BattlegroundAI::GetBattlegroundType(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battleground type identifier for the current battleground instance.
  description: The GetBattlegroundType method returns the BGType enumeration value
    that identifies the specific type of battleground this AI instance is managing.
    This method is typically used by battleground AI systems to determine the rules,
    objectives, and mechanics applicable to the current battleground. The method does
    not require any parameters and is const, meaning it does not modify the state
    of the BattlegroundAI object. It serves as a key identifier for dispatching appropriate
    logic based on battleground type.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns a BGType enumeration value representing the type of battleground
    this AI instance is associated with. Possible values include but are not limited
    to: BattlegroundTypeId::BATTLEGROUND_AV, BattlegroundTypeId::BATTLEGROUND_WS,
    BattlegroundTypeId::BATTLEGROUND_AB, etc., depending on the specific battleground
    implementation.'

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyBattlegroundHandler(BattlegroundAI* bg_ai) {\n    BGType type =\
      \ bg_ai->GetBattlegroundType();\n    switch (type) {\n        case BATTLEGROUND_AV:\n\
      \            // Handle AV specific logic\n            break;\n        case BATTLEGROUND_WS:\n\
      \            // Handle WS specific logic\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Handle unknown type\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within battleground AI logic to make
    decisions based on the battleground type. It's important to note that this method
    returns a cached value and should be reliable for determining battleground mechanics
    during gameplay.
