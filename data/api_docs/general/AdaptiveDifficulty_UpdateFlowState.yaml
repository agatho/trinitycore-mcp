  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: UpdateFlowState
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::UpdateFlowState(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the adaptive difficulty flow state for the specified player
  description: The UpdateFlowState method adjusts the adaptive difficulty settings
    based on the current player's progress, performance, and game session data. This
    method is typically invoked during key gameplay events such as zone changes, combat
    encounters, or when the player's activity level changes significantly. It modifies
    internal difficulty scaling factors to maintain an appropriate challenge level
    for the player's skill and engagement. The method ensures that the game remains
    engaging by dynamically adjusting enemy strength, loot quality, and other difficulty-related
    parameters without requiring manual intervention.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose adaptive difficulty flow state
      needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterCombat(Player* player)\n{\n    sAdaptiveDifficulty->UpdateFlowState(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Flow State After Player Level Up
    code: "void OnPlayerLevelUp(Player* player)\n{\n    // Perform level up logic\n\
      \    player->SetLevel(player->GetLevel() + 1);\n    \n    // Update adaptive\
      \ difficulty to match new player capabilities\n    sAdaptiveDifficulty->UpdateFlowState(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during gameplay, particularly
    in response to significant player actions. It's recommended to avoid calling this
    method excessively in tight loops as it may impact performance. The implementation
    uses internal tracking of player activity and progression to determine appropriate
    difficulty adjustments.
  warnings: Never call this method with a null player pointer as it will likely result
    in a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object is valid and in
    a consistent state before invoking this method.
