  brief: Initializes default AI behavior profiles for adaptive behavior manager
  description: The InitializeDefaultProfiles method sets up and registers the standard
    AI behavior configurations that the AdaptiveBehaviorManager will use to control
    NPC decision-making processes. This method is typically called during server initialization
    or when a new behavior manager instance is created, ensuring that all NPCs have
    baseline behavioral patterns defined. The method configures default settings for
    various AI states such as combat, idle, patrol, and reaction behaviors, establishing
    a foundation upon which custom profiles can be built or overridden. It ensures
    that the adaptive behavior system has a working set of rules before any dynamic
    adjustments are made based on player interaction or environmental conditions.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = new AdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->InitializeDefaultProfiles();

      // Behavior profiles are now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of an AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    instance. Repeated calls may result in duplicate profile registrations or undefined
    behavior. The initialization process is typically synchronous and may block briefly
    while loading default configurations from internal data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method after behavior profiles have already been initialized
    may lead to memory leaks or inconsistent AI behavior states. Ensure that this
    method is invoked only during appropriate initialization phases of the server
    lifecycle.
