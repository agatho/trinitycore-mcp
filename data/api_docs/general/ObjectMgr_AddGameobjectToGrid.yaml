  signature: void ObjectMgr::AddGameobjectToGrid(const int * data)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a game object to the grid system for spatial partitioning and efficient
    object management.
  description: The AddGameobjectToGrid method integrates a game object into the server's
    grid-based spatial partitioning system. This allows the game world to efficiently
    manage and query objects based on their location within the game world. The method
    takes an array of data representing the game object's properties and positions,
    and ensures it is correctly registered in the appropriate grid cells for fast
    retrieval during gameplay operations such as visibility checks, collision detection,
    and AI pathfinding. This process is essential for maintaining performance in large-scale
    game worlds with many dynamic objects.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an array of integers containing game object data including
      position coordinates, map ID, and other relevant properties needed for grid
      registration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int gameObjectData[] = {12345, 100, 200, 300, 1};

      ObjectMgr::instance()->AddGameobjectToGrid(gameObjectData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game object creation system.
    It assumes that the data array contains properly formatted information matching
    the expected structure for grid registration. The method does not validate input
    data beyond basic assumptions about format.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or malformed data can lead to undefined
    behavior and potential crashes. Ensure all coordinates and identifiers are valid
    before calling this function.
