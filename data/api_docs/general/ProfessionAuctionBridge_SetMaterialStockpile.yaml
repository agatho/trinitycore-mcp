  method: SetMaterialStockpile
  signature: void ProfessionAuctionBridge::SetMaterialStockpile(uint32 playerGuid,
    uint32 itemId, const MaterialStockpileConfig & config)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the material stockpile configuration for a player's profession auction
    item.
  description: The SetMaterialStockpile method configures or updates the material
    stockpile settings for a specific item used in profession auctions. This method
    allows setting parameters such as minimum and maximum stock levels, restock thresholds,
    and other inventory management configurations for items that players can auction
    or trade within the context of crafting professions. It is typically invoked when
    a player modifies their auction house settings for a particular material or crafted
    item. The configuration affects how the server manages inventory levels and auction
    behavior for that specific item.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose stockpile configuration
      is being updated. Must be a valid player GUID in the database.
  - name: itemId
    description: The item ID representing the specific material or crafted item for
      which the stockpile settings are configured. Must correspond to an existing
      item in the game database.
  - name: config
    description: A reference to a MaterialStockpileConfig object containing the new
      stockpile parameters such as minimum/maximum levels, restock quantities, and
      other relevant inventory management values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MaterialStockpileConfig config;

      config.minStock = 10;

      config.maxStock = 100;

      config.restockThreshold = 25;

      ProfessionAuctionBridge::SetMaterialStockpile(12345, 1234, config);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal auction house or inventory management
    systems. It may trigger updates to the player's auction listings or stock notifications
    depending on implementation details. Ensure that the MaterialStockpileConfig values
    are within valid ranges to prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values (e.g., negative stock levels) might cause undefined
    behavior or database inconsistencies. This method should only be called when the
    player and item are confirmed to exist in the game world.
