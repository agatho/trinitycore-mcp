  class: PositionUtils
  method: GetMinRange
  signature: float PositionUtils::GetMinRange(Player * bot, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the minimum effective range between a bot player and a target
    unit for combat purposes.
  description: The GetMinRange method computes the shortest distance at which a bot
    player can effectively engage a target unit in combat, taking into account the
    bot's weapon range, spell range, and any applicable combat mechanics. This value
    is used by AI systems to determine optimal positioning and engagement strategies.
    The method considers both melee and ranged attack capabilities of the bot when
    calculating this minimum range. It returns a float value representing the distance
    in yards. The calculation may vary based on the bot's current equipped weapons,
    available spells, and the target's mobility or defensive capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the minimum effective combat range in yards
    between the bot player and the target unit. Returns 0.0 if either the bot or target
    is invalid or if no valid range can be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine combat range
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nUnit* target = ...; //\
      \ Assume target is initialized\nfloat minRange = PositionUtils::GetMinRange(bot,\
      \ target);\nif (minRange > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Bot can engage target at this range\
      \ or closer\n    printf(\"Minimum combat range: %.2f yards\\n\", minRange);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used by AI logic to make decisions about when and
    how to approach targets. The returned value may be influenced by the bot's current
    gear, spell cooldowns, and combat stance. For accurate results, both the bot and
    target should be valid objects in the game world.
  warnings: The method assumes that both parameters are valid pointers to Player and
    Unit objects respectively. Passing null or invalid pointers will likely result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect calculations. The range calculation may not
    account for all possible combat modifiers such as environmental factors or specific
    mob abilities.
