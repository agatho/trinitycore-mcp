  method: TeleportPlayer
  signature: void LFGMgr::TeleportPlayer(Player * player, bool out, bool fromOpcode)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports a player to or from the LFG dungeon based on the specified parameters.
  description: The TeleportPlayer method is responsible for handling player movement
    in and out of LFG (Looking For Group) dungeons. It manages the teleportation process
    for players who are part of a group seeking dungeon content. The method takes
    into account whether the player should be teleported out of the dungeon or into
    one, as well as the source of the teleportation request. This functionality is
    integral to the LFG system's operation and ensures proper player positioning within
    the game world during group dungeon activities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will be teleported. Must not be
      null and must represent a valid player in the game world.
  - name: out
    description: Boolean flag indicating teleportation direction. If true, the player
      is teleported out of the dungeon; if false, the player is teleported into the
      dungeon.
  - name: fromOpcode
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the teleportation was initiated by
      an opcode (client request) or internally by the server system. Used to determine
      appropriate handling and messaging.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Teleport player out of dungeon
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->TeleportPlayer(player, true, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Teleport player into dungeon from opcode
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->TeleportPlayer(player, false, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during LFG queue management and dungeon entry/exit
    processes. It handles the actual movement of players between the instance and
    the world map, including updating player states and sending relevant packets to
    the client.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent segmentation faults. The 'out' parameter must be set correctly based on
    the intended teleportation direction to avoid incorrect player positioning in
    the game world.
