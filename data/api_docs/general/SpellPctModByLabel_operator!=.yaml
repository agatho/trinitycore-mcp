  brief: Compares two SpellPctModByLabel objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this SpellPctModByLabel
    instance and another SpellPctModByLabel object to determine if they are not equal.
    This comparison is typically used in spell effect handling within the TrinityCore
    framework, where percentage modifiers applied to spells may need to be evaluated
    for equality or inequality. The method returns true if the two objects differ
    in any of their member variables, and false if they are identical. This functionality
    supports the core mechanics of spell modifications and effects processing in World
    of Warcraft emulation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether this SpellPctModByLabel object
    is not equal to the provided right operand. True is returned when the objects
    differ, false when they are identical.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check
    code: 'SpellPctModByLabel mod1;

      SpellPctModByLabel mod2;

      bool result = (mod1 != mod2); // Returns true if mods are different'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in spell effect validation
    code: "if (spellEffect->GetPctModByLabel() != SpellPctModByLabel()) {\n    //\
      \ Apply custom percentage modifier logic\n    // This checks if the modifier\
      \ has been set to a non-default value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is likely implemented using member-wise comparison of all relevant
    fields within the SpellPctModByLabel class. The implementation may involve comparing
    internal data structures such as label identifiers, percentage values, or other
    spell modifier properties. As with all comparison operators in TrinityCore, performance
    should be considered when used in tight loops or frequently called code paths.
