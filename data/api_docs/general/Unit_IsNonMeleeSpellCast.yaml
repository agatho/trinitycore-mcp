  class: Unit
  method: IsNonMeleeSpellCast
  signature: bool Unit::IsNonMeleeSpellCast(bool withDelayed, bool skipChanneled,
    bool skipAutorepeat, bool isAutoshoot, bool skipInstant) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is casting a non-melee spell, with optional filtering
    for delayed, channeled, autorepeat, and instant spells.
  description: This method checks if a unit (such as a player or creature) is currently
    casting a spell that is not a melee attack. It provides control over various spell
    types through optional parameters, allowing developers to filter out specific
    spell categories like delayed spells, channeled spells, autorepeat spells, and
    instant spells. The method is commonly used in game mechanics for determining
    spell casting behavior during combat or non-combat situations. This function returns
    true if the unit is actively casting a non-melee spell, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: withDelayed
    description: If true, includes delayed spells in the check; if false, excludes
      them. Delayed spells are those that have a casting time longer than 0ms but
      less than 1 second.
  - name: skipChanneled
    description: If true, excludes channeled spells from the check; if false, includes
      them. Channeled spells are those that require continuous casting over time,
      such as arcane missiles or power word shield.
  - name: skipAutorepeat
    description: If true, excludes autorepeat spells from the check; if false, includes
      them. Autorepeat spells are those that are automatically cast repeatedly, like
      auto shot or auto attack.
  - name: isAutoshoot
    description: If true, includes autoshoot spells in the check; if false, excludes
      them. Autoshoot refers to automatic shooting attacks like auto shot or auto
      attack.
  - name: skipInstant
    description: If true, excludes instant spells from the check; if false, includes
      them. Instant spells are those that have no casting time (0ms), such as spell
      cast with no delay.
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently casting a non-melee spell, false
    otherwise. The method returns false when the unit is not casting any spell or
    when all specified filtering parameters exclude the current spell type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsNonMeleeSpellCast(false, true, true, true, true)) {\n    //\
      \ Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with multiple conditions
    code: "bool isCastingNonMelee = unit->IsNonMeleeSpellCast(true, false, true, false,\
      \ true);\nif (isCastingNonMelee) {\n    // Unit is casting a non-melee spell\
      \ but not channeled or delayed\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell state tracking and may be affected by
    game mechanics such as spell casting time, channeling, and auto attack behavior.
    It is important to note that the method may not accurately reflect all spell types
    in complex scenarios involving multiple spell effects or simultaneous casting.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combat situations, as it might interfere
    with normal gameplay mechanics if used improperly. Also, ensure that parameters
    are correctly set to avoid unintended filtering of spells.
