documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an item is bound to a different map or zone than the current
    one.
  description: This method checks if an item's binding restrictions extend beyond
    the current map and zone, indicating whether the item can be used in other locations.
    It evaluates the item's bound requirements against the current map and zone IDs
    to determine if it's limited to another map or zone. This functionality is crucial
    for determining item usability in different zones and ensuring proper game mechanics
    handling when players move between maps.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is bound to a different map or zone, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the item is not bound to another map or zone, indicating
    it can be used in the current location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(12345);\nif (item && item->IsLimitedToAnotherMapOrZone(player->GetMapId(),\
      \ player->GetZoneId()))\n{\n    // Item is bound to another map or zone\n  \
      \  // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically involves checking the item's binding flags and zone
    restrictions. It may involve multiple checks depending on the item's specific
    binding type, including whether it's bound to a specific zone or map. Performance
    considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls when the item is not bound to
    another map or zone.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect item usability and
    game mechanics. Be aware that items bound to specific zones may have restrictions
    on usage in other zones, potentially causing issues if not handled properly.
