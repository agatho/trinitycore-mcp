documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from a battleground queue with specified parameters.
  description: The BGQueueRemoveEvent method is responsible for removing a player
    from a battleground queue. It takes in the player's GUID, the battleground instance
    GUID, the queue type ID, and a removal time to process the removal event. This
    method is typically used during battleground matchmaking or when a player leaves
    a queue before being assigned to a battleground. The removal time parameter likely
    indicates when the removal should take effect or how long the player has been
    queued.
  parameters:
  - name: pl_guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the player being removed from the
      queue. This is used to identify which specific player's queue entry should be
      removed.
  - name: bgInstanceGUID
    description: The instance GUID of the battleground that the player was queued
      for. This helps identify the specific battleground instance the player was waiting
      to join.
  - name: bgQueueTypeId
    description: The type ID of the battleground queue from which the player is being
      removed. This identifies the specific queue type (e.g., 1v1, 3v3, 5v5) that
      the player was in.
  - name: removeTime
    description: The time value indicating when or how long the player has been queued
      for removal. This may be used to determine queue timing or cooldown periods.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Removal from Queue
    code: 'BGQueueRemoveEvent removeEvent(12345, 67890, 2, 10);

      // Removes player with GUID 12345 from the 3v3 battleground queue

      // for instance 67890, with removal time set to 10'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal event system that manages battleground
    queue operations. It may be called by other subsystems like the battleground manager
    or player session handlers when a player leaves a queue. The exact behavior might
    depend on how the queue removal is processed in the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could result in players remaining stuck in
    queues or incorrect queue state management, which can affect matchmaking and gameplay
    balance.
