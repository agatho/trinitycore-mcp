  method: GetConfig
  signature: MovementArbiterConfig MovementArbiter::GetConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the configuration settings of the movement arbiter instance.
  description: The GetConfig method returns a copy of the current configuration object
    associated with this MovementArbiter instance. This configuration typically contains
    parameters that control how movement decisions are made, such as pathfinding behavior,
    speed limits, or collision avoidance settings. The returned MovementArbiterConfig
    object is immutable and represents a snapshot of the configuration at the time
    of the call. This method does not modify any internal state and can be called
    safely from multiple threads concurrently.
  parameters: []
  returns: A MovementArbiterConfig object containing the current configuration settings
    for this movement arbiter instance. The returned object reflects the configuration
    as it existed when the method was invoked, and changes to the original configuration
    after this call will not affect the returned value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MovementArbiterConfig config = arbiter->GetConfig();

      uint32 maxSpeed = config.GetMaxSpeed();

      bool usePathfinding = config.UsePathfinding();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Configuration Values
    code: "MovementArbiter* arbiter = ...;\nMovementArbiterConfig config = arbiter->GetConfig();\n\
      if (config.GetMovementType() == MovementArbiterConfig::MOVEMENT_TYPE_NORMAL)\n\
      {\n    // Handle normal movement logic\n}\nelse if (config.GetMovementType()\
      \ == MovementArbiterConfig::MOVEMENT_TYPE_EVASIVE)\n{\n    // Handle evasive\
      \ movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a shallow copy of the configuration object, so modifications
    to the returned object will not affect the internal state of the MovementArbiter.
    The configuration object is typically thread-safe for reading operations and should
    be treated as read-only after retrieval.
