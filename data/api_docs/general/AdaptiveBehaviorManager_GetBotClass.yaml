  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: GetBotClass
  signature: int AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetBotClass() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the class identifier of the bot managed by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    instance.
  description: The GetBotClass method returns an integer representing the class type
    of the bot controlled by this AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This value typically corresponds
    to the standard World of Warcraft class constants (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for
    Paladin, etc.). The method provides access to the bot's class information which
    is essential for behavior decision-making, spell selection, and role-specific
    actions within the adaptive AI system. This function does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call multiple times. It assumes that a valid bot has been
    assigned to the manager prior to invocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'An integer representing the class of the bot. Common values include: 1
    (Warrior), 2 (Paladin), 3 (Hunter), 4 (Rogue), 5 (Priest), 6 (Death Knight), 7
    (Shaman), 8 (Mage), 9 (Warlock), 10 (Monk), 11 (Druid), 12 (Demon Hunter). Returns
    0 if no bot is assigned or the class information is unavailable.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;\nint botClass = behaviorManager->GetBotClass();\n\
      if (botClass == 1) {\n    // Bot is a Warrior\n    printf(\"Bot is a Warrior\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Behavior Selection Based on Class
    code: "AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;\nint botClass = behaviorManager->GetBotClass();\n\
      switch (botClass) {\n    case 1: // Warrior\n        // Apply warrior-specific\
      \ behaviors\n        break;\n    case 8: // Mage\n        // Apply mage-specific\
      \ behaviors\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Default behavior\n   \
      \     break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the AdaptiveBehaviorManager to
    have a valid bot assigned. If no bot is assigned, it may return an unexpected
    value or 0. The returned class ID corresponds directly to the values used in the
    World of Warcraft client and database for character classes.
  warnings: Ensure that a bot has been properly initialized and assigned to the AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    before calling this method. Calling this method on an uninitialized manager may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect return values.
