  signature: void Unit::_RegisterDynObject(DynamicObject * dynObj)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a dynamic object with the unit's associated world objects.
  description: This method registers a DynamicObject with the Unit, allowing the unit
    to track and manage dynamic objects such as area effects or summoned objects.
    The registration process ensures that the dynamic object is properly linked to
    the unit's context, enabling proper handling of game mechanics like collision
    detection and object removal. This method is typically used during spell effects
    or summoning operations where dynamic objects need to be managed within the unit's
    scope.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Registration Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      DynamicObject* dynObj = new DynamicObject;

      unit->_RegisterDynObject(dynObj);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely involves internal tracking of dynamic objects through a
    container or list, ensuring that the object remains accessible for subsequent
    operations within the unit's scope. Performance considerations may arise from
    frequent registration/deregistration operations.
  warnings: Improper handling of dynamic object registration can lead to memory leaks
    or invalid access errors if the object is not properly managed. Ensure that the
    dynamic object is valid and not already registered before calling this method.
