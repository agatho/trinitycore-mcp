  class: ZoneCache
  method: FindHostilesInRange
  signature: int ZoneCache::FindHostilesInRange(float x, float y, float z, float range,
    uint32 maxResults) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds hostile units within a specified range of a given location in the zone
    cache.
  description: The FindHostilesInRange method searches for hostile units (such as
    enemy players or creatures) located within a defined spherical area around a given
    coordinate. It performs a spatial query against the cached zone data, returning
    a count of matching hostiles. The method is commonly used by AI systems and game
    mechanics that require knowledge of nearby threats. Hostile units are determined
    based on faction relationships and player/creature states. The search is limited
    to the current zone's cached entities for performance reasons.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the center point for the range search.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the center point for the range search.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the center point for the range search.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance from the center point to consider units as within
      range.
  - name: maxResults
    description: The maximum number of hostile units to return. If zero, no limit
      is applied.
  returns: Returns the number of hostile units found within the specified range. A
    negative value may indicate an error or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int hostileCount = zoneCache.FindHostilesInRange(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f,
      30.0f, 5);
    language: cpp
  - title: Find All Hostiles in Range
    code: int allHostiles = zoneCache.FindHostilesInRange(player->GetPositionX(),
      player->GetPositionY(), player->GetPositionZ(), 50.0f, 0); // 0 means no limit
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on cached zone data and may not reflect real-time changes
    in unit positions. It is optimized for performance by limiting results to the
    current zone's entities. The method does not perform any actual movement or pathfinding;
    it only queries existing cached information.
  warnings: Using a large range or zero maxResults can cause performance issues if
    many units are present in the area. Ensure that coordinates are valid and within
    expected bounds before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
