  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleNoReagentUseAura
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleNoReagentUseAura(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Handles the application or removal of aura effects that prevent reagent consumption
    for spell casting.
  description: The HandleNoReagentUseAura method manages the behavior of auras that
    disable the requirement for mana, health, or other resources when casting spells.
    This function is typically invoked during aura application or removal to modify
    the caster's ability to consume reagents. It adjusts internal flags and state
    within the aura system to reflect whether reagent usage should be suppressed.
    The method operates based on the provided AuraApplication context, the mode of
    operation (such as application or removal), and a boolean flag indicating if the
    effect is being applied or removed.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This contains contextual information about the aura's target,
      caster, and current state.
  - name: mode
    description: An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the mode of operation for the
      aura effect. Typically used to distinguish between different stages of aura
      lifecycle such as application or removal.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag specifying whether the aura is being applied (true)
      or removed (false). This determines how the internal state and effects are adjusted
      during execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying No Reagent Use Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* aura = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 1;

      bool apply = true;

      aura->HandleNoReagentUseAura(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing No Reagent Use Aura
    code: 'AuraEffect* aura = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication app;

      uint8 mode = 2;

      bool apply = false;

      aura->HandleNoReagentUseAura(&app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's aura handling system and interacts
    with spell casting logic to control reagent consumption. It should be called only
    from within the aura application/removal process and not directly by external
    systems.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in spell
    casting, particularly around resource consumption. Ensure that the AuraApplication
    object passed is valid and properly initialized before calling.
