documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AreaTrigger object with default values and prepares it
    for use in the game world.
  description: The AreaTrigger constructor initializes a new instance of the AreaTrigger
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the area trigger, including its
    unique identifier, position, dimensions, and associated data structures required
    for proper operation within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor ensures
    that all necessary member variables are properly initialized before the area trigger
    can be registered with the game world or used in spell effects. It is typically
    called internally when creating new area trigger instances through the game's
    object management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AreaTrigger instance
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      // The trigger is now initialized and ready for use

      // with methods like SetPosition(), SetRadius(), etc.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by developers. Instead,
    area triggers are usually created through the GameObject or Spell system in TrinityCore.
    The constructor ensures that all internal data structures are properly initialized
    to prevent undefined behavior when the area trigger is used in gameplay.
