documentation:
  brief: Returns the source location of a spell cast target.
  description: The GetSrc method retrieves the SpellDestination object representing
    the source location from which a spell was cast. This is typically used in spell
    handling to determine where the spell originated, such as from a player's position
    or an object's location. The returned pointer is const, meaning it should not
    be modified directly. The method does not perform any validation on whether the
    source is valid or set; callers should ensure the SpellCastTargets object has
    been properly initialized before calling this method.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a SpellDestination object representing the spell's source
    location, or nullptr if no source has been set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve spell source
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// ... initialize targets with source ...\n\
      const SpellDestination* src = targets.GetSrc();\nif (src)\n{\n    // Use src->GetPosition()\
      \ or other methods\n    WorldLocation const& pos = src->GetPosition();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using source location in spell effect logic
    code: "void HandleSpellEffect(Spell* spell)\n{\n    SpellCastTargets const& targets\
      \ = spell->GetSpellCastTargets();\n    const SpellDestination* src = targets.GetSrc();\n\
      \    if (src && src->IsPosition())\n    {\n        // Use source position for\
      \ area-of-effect calculations\n        Position const& sourcePos = src->GetPosition();\n\
      \        // Perform logic based on source position\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned SpellDestination pointer is valid only as long as the SpellCastTargets
    object remains in scope and unmodified. This method does not perform any deep
    copying or internal caching of the destination data, so it's safe to call multiple
    times but results should not be stored for extended periods without checking validity.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned SpellDestination pointer directly as it is
    const. If the source has not been set in the SpellCastTargets object, this method
    will return nullptr which must be checked before using the result.
