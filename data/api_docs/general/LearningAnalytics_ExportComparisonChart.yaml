  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: ExportComparisonChart
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::ExportComparisonChart(const std::vector<uint32_t>
    & botGuids, const std::string & filename) const
documentation:
  brief: Exports a comparison chart of learning analytics data for specified bots
    to a file.
  description: The ExportComparisonChart method generates and saves a comparison chart
    based on learning analytics data from multiple bot entities. It takes a vector
    of bot GUIDs and writes the resulting chart data to a specified filename. This
    functionality is typically used for analyzing and visualizing the performance
    or behavior differences between various bots in a learning context. The method
    does not return any value but performs file I/O operations to persist the generated
    chart data.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuids
    description: A vector of unique identifiers (GUIDs) representing the bot entities
      whose learning analytics data will be included in the comparison chart.
  - name: filename
    description: The name of the file where the generated comparison chart data will
      be saved. This should be a valid path with appropriate write permissions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Export Comparison Chart for Multiple Bots
    code: 'std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      LearningAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.ExportComparisonChart(botGuids, "bot_comparison_chart.csv");'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the learning analytics data for each bot GUID is
    available and properly indexed within the system. It may require sufficient disk
    space to write the output file. The chart format and content depend on internal
    implementation details of the LearningAnalytics class.
  warnings: Ensure that all provided bot GUIDs correspond to existing entities, otherwise
    the method might produce incomplete or invalid chart data. Also, verify that the
    application has write permissions to the specified filename path to avoid I/O
    errors.
