  class: PathGenerator
  method: SetEndPosition
  signature: void PathGenerator::SetEndPosition(const int & point)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the end position for pathfinding calculations within the PathGenerator.
  description: The SetEndPosition method configures the destination point for pathfinding
    operations. This method is typically used in conjunction with other pathfinding
    components to determine a valid route from a starting position to the specified
    endpoint. The method accepts an integer parameter representing the index or identifier
    of the target point within the navigation system. It updates internal state variables
    that are subsequently used by path calculation algorithms to generate movement
    paths for NPCs or players. This method should be called before initiating pathfinding
    computations to ensure accurate route generation.
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: An integer value representing the index or identifier of the end
      position in the navigation mesh or waypoint system. Valid values depend on the
      specific implementation and may correspond to waypoint indices, node IDs, or
      grid coordinates within the game world's pathfinding system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting End Position for NPC Movement
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.SetEndPosition(42);

      // This sets the destination point to waypoint index 42 for subsequent pathfinding
      operations.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Path End Position Update
    code: "void UpdateDestination(Unit* unit, uint32 newPointIndex) {\n    PathGenerator*\
      \ pathGen = unit->GetPathGenerator();\n    if (pathGen) {\n        pathGen->SetEndPosition(newPointIndex);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state and should only be called when the PathGenerator
    is in a valid state for configuration. It does not perform validation on the input
    parameter, so callers must ensure that the point index is valid within the context
    of the navigation system. The method may trigger internal updates to cached pathfinding
    data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid point index may result in undefined
    behavior or failed pathfinding operations. Ensure that the point parameter corresponds
    to a valid location within the game world's navigation mesh before calling this
    method.
