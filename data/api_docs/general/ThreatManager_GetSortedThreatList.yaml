  signature: int ThreatManager::GetSortedThreatList() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the sorted threat list of all targets in the ThreatManager
  description: The GetSortedThreatList method retrieves and returns a sorted list
    of threat values for all targets currently in the ThreatManager's threat list.
    This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's AI system to determine which
    targets are currently receiving the most threat from a creature or player. The
    sorting is typically performed based on threat values, with higher values appearing
    first. The returned integer represents the count of elements in the sorted threat
    list, allowing developers to iterate through the list and perform further processing
    or analysis.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents an integer indicating the number of elements
    in the sorted threat list. This value corresponds to the total number of targets
    currently in the ThreatManager's threat list, sorted by threat level in descending
    order.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int threatCount = threatManager->GetSortedThreatList();\nfor (int i = 0;\
      \ i < threatCount; ++i)\n{\n    // Process each threat element\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other threat management
    methods such as AddThreat or RemoveThreat to maintain accurate threat lists. Performance
    considerations may arise when dealing with large numbers of targets, as sorting
    operations can be computationally expensive.
  warnings: The method should not be called during active combat situations where
    threat values are rapidly changing, as it may return outdated threat values if
    the list has not yet been updated after recent changes.
