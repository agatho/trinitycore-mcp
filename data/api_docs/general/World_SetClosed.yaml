  class: World
  method: SetClosed
  signature: void World::SetClosed(bool val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the closed status of the world server to indicate if it is accepting
    new connections.
  description: The SetClosed method configures whether the World of Warcraft server
    is open or closed to new player connections. When set to true, the server will
    reject new login attempts and display a 'server closed' message to players trying
    to connect. This is commonly used during maintenance periods, shutdowns, or when
    the server needs to be temporarily inaccessible. The method directly modifies
    an internal flag within the World class that controls connection acceptance logic.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: Boolean value indicating the closed status. True sets the server
      to closed (rejecting new connections), false sets it to open (accepting new
      connections).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Close Server for Maintenance
    code: 'World::instance()->SetClosed(true);

      // Server will now reject new player connections'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reopen Server After Maintenance
    code: 'World::instance()->SetClosed(false);

      // Server will resume accepting new player connections'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from server management scripts or during
    shutdown procedures. The change takes effect immediately without requiring a server
    restart. It's important to note that existing players in the world are not affected
    by this setting and will continue playing normally.
  warnings: Setting the server to closed while players are connected may cause them
    to be disconnected abruptly. This method should only be used during planned maintenance
    windows or when proper announcements have been made to players. Improper use could
    lead to negative player experience.
