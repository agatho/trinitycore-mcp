  brief: Handles the logic when a mongoose bite spell is cast, updating tracking statistics
    and cooldowns.
  description: The OnMongooseBiteCast method is invoked when a player successfully
    casts the Mongoose Bite ability. This method updates internal tracking mechanisms
    to record the cast event, manages cooldown timers, and potentially triggers related
    game mechanics such as proc effects or resource generation. It serves as an event
    handler that integrates with the spell casting system and maintains state for
    the Mongoose Bite ability within the context of a player's actions.

  notes: This method is typically called from within the spell casting or AI logic
    flow. It assumes that the player has valid access to the Mongoose Bite ability
    and that all prerequisites for casting have been satisfied.
