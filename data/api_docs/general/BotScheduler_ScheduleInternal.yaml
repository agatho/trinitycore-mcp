  class: BotScheduler
  method: ScheduleInternal
  signature: void BotScheduler::ScheduleInternal(int guid, ScheduleEntry::Action action,
    int when, uint32 data1, uint32 data2)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules a bot action for execution at a specified time with provided data.
  description: The ScheduleInternal method is used to queue a specific action for
    a bot identified by its GUID to be executed at a given time in the future. This
    method is typically used internally by the BotScheduler to manage and dispatch
    scheduled tasks for AI-controlled bots within the TrinityCore framework. The action
    to be performed, along with associated data (data1 and data2), is stored for later
    execution. The scheduling mechanism allows for delayed or periodic bot behavior
    without blocking the main game loop. This method does not directly execute the
    action but merely registers it for future execution based on the provided timing
    information.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that will perform the scheduled
      action. This value identifies which specific bot instance the action is associated
      with.
  - name: action
    description: The action to be performed by the bot, represented as a ScheduleEntry::Action
      enum value. Defines what type of operation should be executed at the scheduled
      time.
  - name: when
    description: The absolute time (in game ticks or milliseconds) when the action
      should be executed. This is typically a future timestamp relative to the current
      game time.
  - name: data1
    description: First piece of data associated with the scheduled action. The meaning
      and usage of this parameter depends on the specific action being scheduled.
  - name: data2
    description: Second piece of data associated with the scheduled action. Similar
      to data1, its interpretation is determined by the action type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Schedule a bot to move to a location after 5 seconds
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.ScheduleInternal(12345, ScheduleEntry::Action::MOVE_TO_LOCATION, 5000,
      1000, 2000);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal scheduling system for AI bots and should
    not be called directly from external modules unless implementing custom bot behavior.
    The 'when' parameter represents a future time point in the game's time system,
    typically measured in milliseconds since server start or similar reference point.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the 'when' parameter can result in actions being executed
    immediately or never executing at all. Ensure that data1 and data2 parameters
    are properly initialized for the given action type to prevent undefined behavior.
