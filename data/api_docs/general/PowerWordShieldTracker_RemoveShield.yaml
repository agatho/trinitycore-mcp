  signature: void PowerWordShieldTracker::RemoveShield(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: 'Removes a Power Word: Shield effect from the target with the specified GUID.'
  description: 'The RemoveShield method is responsible for eliminating a Power Word:
    Shield buff from a specific target in the game world. This method typically gets
    invoked when the shield is either fully absorbed, expired, or manually removed
    by an external effect. The method operates on the internal tracking system of
    the PowerWordShieldTracker class, which maintains records of active shields and
    their associated targets. It ensures proper cleanup of shield data and may trigger
    related events such as updating the target''s health display or notifying the
    client about the shield removal.'
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: 'The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit from which the Power
      Word: Shield effect should be removed. This value must correspond to a valid
      GameObject, Creature, or Player in the game world.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Shield from Target
    code: 'PowerWordShieldTracker tracker;

      tracker.RemoveShield(12345); // Removes shield from target with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the specified GUID corresponds to a unit currently
    tracked by the PowerWordShieldTracker. It is recommended to verify the existence
    of the target before calling this method to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Calling RemoveShield with an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to
    undefined behavior or access violations. Always validate input parameters and
    ensure that the target has an active shield before attempting removal.
