  class: World
  method: Update
  signature: void World::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the world state and processes all active game objects, players, and
    systems.
  description: The World::Update method is a core game loop function that advances
    the simulation state by the specified time delta. It handles processing of all
    active game entities including players, creatures, game objects, and world events.
    This method is typically called once per game tick from the main server loop and
    ensures that all world systems remain synchronized with the passage of time. The
    method performs various internal updates such as AI processing, spell effects,
    movement calculations, and network packet handling.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since last update call. Represents the
      amount of time that has passed since the previous update cycle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetUpdateDiff();\n    sWorld->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Timing Management
    code: "uint32 World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Process world updates\n  \
      \  UpdateSessions(diff);\n    UpdateDynamicObjects(diff);\n    UpdateGameEvents();\n\
      \    UpdateCorpseRespawn();\n    UpdateMapSystem();\n    \n    // Handle global\
      \ world timers\n    m_worldTickTimer.Update(diff);\n    \n    return diff;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from the main server thread and must not be called
    from multiple threads simultaneously. The 'diff' parameter should represent actual
    elapsed time since last update to maintain accurate game state progression. Performance
    of this method directly affects overall server responsiveness.
  warnings: Never call this method with invalid time deltas as it may cause inconsistent
    game state or crashes. This method modifies global world state and should not
    be interrupted by other operations that might affect the same systems.
