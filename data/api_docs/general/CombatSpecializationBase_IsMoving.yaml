  method: IsMoving
  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::IsMoving() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently in a moving state.
  description: The IsMoving method checks if the combat specialization base unit is
    currently in motion. This method is typically used within the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to evaluate the movement status of units during
    combat scenarios. It returns true if the unit is actively moving, and false otherwise.
    The implementation likely relies on internal movement flags or velocity tracking
    mechanisms to determine this state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the unit is currently moving.
    True indicates active movement, while false indicates the unit is stationary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->IsMoving()) {\n    // Handle logic\
      \ for when player is moving during combat\n    DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Movement-Based Skill Activation
    code: "if (enemy->GetCombatSpecialization()->IsMoving() && !player->GetCombatSpecialization()->IsMoving())\
      \ {\n    // Player is attacking a moving target\n    player->CastSpell(enemy,\
      \ SPELL_MOVING_TARGET_ATTACK);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve performance considerations as it could be called
    frequently during combat updates. It's recommended to cache the result if the
    movement state is checked multiple times within a single game tick.
