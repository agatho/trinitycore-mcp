documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player with the specified GUID is a member of the group
  description: The IsMember method determines whether a player identified by their
    global unique identifier (GUID) is currently a member of the group. This method
    performs a lookup within the group's internal member list to verify membership
    status. It is commonly used in game logic to validate player participation in
    group activities, such as loot distribution, quest progression, or instance locking
    mechanisms. The method does not perform any side effects and simply returns a
    boolean result indicating membership status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player with the specified GUID is currently a member
    of the group; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Membership Check
    code: "if (group->IsMember(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player is in the group, proceed\
      \ with group-specific actions\n    SendGroupMessage(\"Welcome back to the group!\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Player is not in the group\n    SendErrorMessage(\"You\
      \ are not a member of this group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Loot Distribution
    code: "void HandleLootRoll(Player* player, uint32 lootId) {\n    if (!group->IsMember(player->GetGUID().GetCounter()))\
      \ {\n        player->SendLootRelease(lootId);\n        return;\n    }\n    //\
      \ Proceed with normal loot distribution logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the group's member list, so
    performance may degrade with very large groups. The GUID parameter should be a
    valid player GUID obtained from player objects or database lookups. This method
    is thread-safe as long as the group object itself is not being modified concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to an actual player
    in the game world, otherwise the result will always be false. Be cautious when
    using this method in high-frequency loops as it may impact performance with large
    groups.
