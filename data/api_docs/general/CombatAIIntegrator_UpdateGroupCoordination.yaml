documentation:
  brief: Updates group coordination state for combat AI integration
  description: The UpdateGroupCoordination method synchronizes the current combat
    AI state with group members in a World of Warcraft instance. This method ensures
    that all group participants maintain consistent awareness of combat events, positioning,
    and tactical decisions. It typically handles communication between the main combat
    AI and subordinate group members, updating their coordination flags, threat tables,
    and synchronized actions. The method is called during combat updates to maintain
    real-time group synchronization.

  - title: Basic usage in combat update loop
    code: "void CombatAIIntegrator::UpdateCombatState()\n{\n    // ... combat logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateGroupCoordination();\n    // ... more logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during combat state updates and should be
    called frequently enough to maintain synchronization without causing performance
    issues. The implementation likely involves checking group member states, updating
    shared combat variables, and broadcasting relevant information to group members.
