  signature: std::string BehaviorAdaptation::MapIndexToAction(uint32_t index) const
documentation:
  brief: Maps an index value to its corresponding action string identifier.
  description: The MapIndexToAction method translates a numeric index into a human-readable
    action string. This is typically used within behavior adaptation systems where
    actions are represented by integer indices and need to be converted back to their
    symbolic names for logging, debugging, or configuration purposes. The method performs
    a lookup operation based on the provided index value and returns the associated
    action name as a string. It's commonly employed in AI decision-making processes
    where behaviors are indexed for efficient storage and retrieval.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string representing the action name corresponding to the given index.
    Returns an empty string if the index is not found or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation behavior;

      uint32_t actionIndex = 5;

      std::string actionName = behavior.MapIndexToAction(actionIndex);

      // Returns the string representation of action at index 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal mapping table or array to perform the
    index-to-action conversion. Performance is expected to be O(1) for valid indices,
    but may involve a lookup operation that could be optimized in performance-critical
    scenarios.
