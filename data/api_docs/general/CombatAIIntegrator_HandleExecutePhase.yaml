  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::HandleExecutePhase()
documentation:
  brief: Executes the combat AI phase logic for the integrator.
  description: The HandleExecutePhase method is responsible for managing and executing
    the core combat AI behavior within the CombatAIIntegrator class. This method typically
    evaluates the current combat state, determines appropriate actions based on enemy
    proximity, health status, and spell availability, and triggers the necessary AI
    routines to engage or disengage from combat. It serves as a central execution
    point for all combat-related AI decisions and is usually invoked during the creature's
    update cycle or in response to combat events such as target acquisition or health
    changes.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void Creature::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_CombatAIIntegrator)\n\
      \        m_CombatAIIntegrator->HandleExecutePhase();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the creature's update loop and
    should not be invoked directly unless necessary. It relies on internal state tracking
    of targets, health, and spell cooldowns to make decisions.
