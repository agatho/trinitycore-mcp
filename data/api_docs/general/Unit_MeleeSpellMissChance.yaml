documentation:
  brief: Calculates the chance for a melee attack to miss a target.
  description: The MeleeSpellMissChance method determines the probability that a melee
    attack will miss its target, taking into account various factors such as the attacker's
    level difference, target's resistance, and the type of attack. This method is
    crucial for understanding combat mechanics in World of Warcraft, particularly
    when calculating hit rates for physical attacks. It returns a float value representing
    the percentage chance of missing, where 0.0 represents no chance of missing (100%
    accuracy) and higher values indicate increased chance of missing.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: Pointer to the target unit against which the attack is being performed.
      This parameter determines the defensive attributes used in calculation, such
      as target's resistance or level difference.
  - name: attType
    description: Integer representing the type of attack being performed (melee, ranged,
      or spell). This affects how the miss chance is calculated, with different attack
      types having different base miss rates and modifiers.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure for the spell being cast. This
      parameter allows for specific spell-based calculations, such as those involving
      spell penetration or special effects that may modify the miss chance.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the percentage chance that the attack
    will miss its target. Values range from 0.0 (no chance of missing) to 1.0 (100%
    chance of missing). This value is calculated based on game mechanics and can be
    used to determine whether an attack hits or misses during combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float missChance = attacker->MeleeSpellMissChance(target, ATTACK_MELEE,\
      \ nullptr);\nif (missChance > 0.5f)\n    printf(\"Attack has a 50%% chance of\
      \ missing\\n\");"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with spell info
    code: 'SpellInfo* spell = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);

      float missChance = attacker->MeleeSpellMissChance(target, ATTACK_SPELL, spell);

      printf("Spell attack has %.2f%% chance of missing\n", missChance * 100);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat calculations to determine whether
    an attack hits or misses. It should be called during the actual combat process,
    not before. Performance considerations include that this method may involve multiple
    calculations based on target's attributes and attacker's level difference.
  warnings: The method assumes that both attacker and victim are valid pointers. If
    either pointer is null, it could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Also note
    that this method does not account for critical hits or other special effects like
    those from talents or buffs.
