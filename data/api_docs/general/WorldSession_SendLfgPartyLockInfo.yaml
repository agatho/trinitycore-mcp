documentation:
  brief: Sends LFG party lock information to the client
  description: This method sends a packet to the connected client containing information
    about the current LFG (Looking for Group) party lock status. It is used to inform
    players about whether their group is locked for specific LFG activities, such
    as dungeons or raids. The packet includes details about the lock state, which
    helps prevent players from joining incompatible groups or losing their current
    group assignments during LFG operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a LFG context
    code: "void HandleLfgLockInfoRequest(WorldPacket& recvData)\n{\n    SendLfgPartyLockInfo();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player's LFG party status changes,
    or when the client requests updated lock information. The packet sent by this
    method is part of the LFG system's communication protocol and should only be invoked
    when there is actual lock state data to transmit.
