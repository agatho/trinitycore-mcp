documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a const pointer to an AreaTriggerSpawn object by its spawn ID from
    the AreaTriggerDataStore.
  description: The GetAreaTriggerSpawn method retrieves a constant reference to an
    AreaTriggerSpawn object using its unique spawn identifier. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore server framework to access area trigger spawn data,
    which defines how and where area triggers (such as quest objectives or environmental
    effects) are instantiated in the game world. The returned pointer is const, meaning
    the caller cannot modify the underlying AreaTriggerSpawn object through this interface.
    The method performs a lookup in an internal data structure that maps spawn IDs
    to their corresponding area trigger spawn definitions. If no matching spawn ID
    is found, the method will return a null pointer, indicating that no area trigger
    spawn exists with the specified identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an AreaTriggerSpawn object if a matching spawn ID is
    found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no such spawn exists in the data store.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const AreaTriggerSpawn* spawn = areaTriggerDataStore->GetAreaTriggerSpawn(12345);\n\
      if (spawn != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the spawn data\n    std::cout << \"Found\
      \ area trigger spawn with ID: \" << spawn->Id << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "const AreaTriggerSpawn* spawn = areaTriggerDataStore->GetAreaTriggerSpawn(player->GetAreaTriggerSpawnId());\n\
      if (spawn && spawn->IsActive)\n{\n    // Process active area trigger spawn\n\
      \    DoAreaTriggerEffect(spawn);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid or inactive\
      \ spawn\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Invalid or inactive area trigger spawn\
      \ ID: {}\", player->GetAreaTriggerSpawnId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only performs read operations on the internal
    data store. The returned pointer remains valid for the lifetime of the AreaTriggerDataStore
    instance and should not be stored or used beyond that scope. Performance-wise,
    this lookup operation is optimized using a hash map or similar fast-access container
    structure.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before dereferencing the returned
    pointer to avoid segmentation faults. The method assumes valid spawn IDs are passed;
    invalid IDs may result in null returns without error reporting.
