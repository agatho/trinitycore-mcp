  class: BotAccountMgr
  method: DeleteBotAccount
  signature: void BotAccountMgr::DeleteBotAccount(uint32 bnetAccountId, std::function<void
    (bool)> callback)
documentation:
  brief: Deletes a bot account associated with the specified Battle.net account ID.
  description: 'The DeleteBotAccount method removes a bot account from the system
    that is linked to a specific Battle.net account identifier. This function operates
    asynchronously and accepts a callback to notify when the deletion process completes.
    It is typically used in automated systems or game bots where accounts need to
    be managed dynamically. The method ensures that all related data associated with
    the bot account is properly cleaned up, including any character data, inventory,
    or session information. Precondition: The specified Battle.net account ID must
    correspond to an existing bot account; otherwise, the operation may have no effect
    or throw an error depending on implementation.'
  parameters:
  - name: bnetAccountId
    description: The unique identifier of the Battle.net account associated with the
      bot account to be deleted. Must be a valid uint32 value representing a registered
      Battle.net account.
  - name: callback
    description: A std::function<void(bool)> callback that will be invoked upon completion
      of the deletion operation. The boolean parameter indicates success (true) or
      failure (false) of the deletion process.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotAccountMgr::DeleteBotAccount(123456789, [](bool success) {\n    if (success)\
      \ {\n        std::cout << \"Bot account deleted successfully.\" << std::endl;\n\
      \    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Failed to delete bot account.\" << std::endl;\n\
      \    }\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is asynchronous and does not block execution while performing
    the deletion. The callback ensures that developers can react appropriately once
    the operation completes. Ensure that all references to the deleted bot account
    are invalidated after calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent Battle.net account
    ID may lead to undefined behavior or silent failures. Always validate inputs before
    invoking this method.
