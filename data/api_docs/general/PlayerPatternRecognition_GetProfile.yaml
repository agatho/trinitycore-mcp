documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a player profile by its unique identifier (GUID) from the pattern
    recognition system
  description: The GetProfile method fetches a PlayerProfile object associated with
    a specific player GUID from the PlayerPatternRecognition system. This method is
    typically used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore to access detailed player behavior
    or identification data stored within the pattern recognition framework. The returned
    shared pointer provides safe access to the profile data, which may include tracking
    information, behavioral patterns, or other profiling metrics collected for the
    specified player. The method assumes that a valid GUID has been provided and that
    the corresponding profile exists in the system's internal storage.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose profile is to be
      retrieved. This should be a positive integer representing the player's unique
      database ID.
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<PlayerProfile> pointing to the requested player profile
    if it exists, or a null pointer if no profile is found for the given GUID. The
    returned pointer ensures automatic memory management and safe access to the profile
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Profile Retrieval
    code: "PlayerPatternRecognition* patternRec = ...;\nstd::shared_ptr<PlayerProfile>\
      \ profile = patternRec->GetProfile(12345);\nif (profile)\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ profile data\n    std::cout << \"Found profile for player: \" << profile->GetGUID()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Profile Access with Error Handling
    code: "PlayerPatternRecognition* patternRec = ...;\nint playerId = 98765;\nstd::shared_ptr<PlayerProfile>\
      \ profile = patternRec->GetProfile(playerId);\nif (!profile)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ case where profile doesn't exist\n    sLog->outError(\"No profile found for\
      \ player GUID %u\", playerId);\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with profile usage\n\
      uint32 accountId = profile->GetAccountId();\nstd::string playerName = profile->GetName();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in an internal data structure, so
    performance may vary depending on the number of stored profiles. The returned
    shared_ptr automatically manages memory and should be used with proper null checking.
    This method is thread-safe if the underlying data structures are properly synchronized.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    player in the database; otherwise, a null pointer will be returned. Be cautious
    about holding onto shared_ptr references for extended periods as they may prevent
    garbage collection of profile data.
