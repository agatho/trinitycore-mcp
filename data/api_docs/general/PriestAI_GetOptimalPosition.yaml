api:
  class: PriestAI
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int PriestAI::GetOptimalPosition(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position for the priest to cast spells
    based on target proximity and spell requirements.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best location for a Priest
    AI to stand when casting spells, considering factors such as target distance,
    spell range limitations, and combat positioning. This method is typically used
    during spell selection and execution to ensure optimal effectiveness while maintaining
    safety from enemy attacks. The method evaluates the current position relative
    to the target and returns a calculated optimal position that maximizes spell efficacy
    and minimizes risk. It may consider various spell-specific parameters such as
    area of effect, line of sight requirements, and positioning constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position
      index. This parameter specifies which target the optimal position should be
      calculated relative to.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal position.
    A positive value typically indicates a valid position, while negative values may
    indicate failure conditions such as invalid targets or positioning constraints
    that cannot be satisfied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetOptimalPosition
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nint optimalPos = priestAI->GetOptimalPosition(&targetId);\n\
      if (optimalPos > 0) {\n    // Proceed with spell casting at optimal position\n\
      \    printf(\"Optimal position: %d\\n\", optimalPos);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid position case\n    printf(\"Failed to calculate optimal position\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Priest AI subsystem and should only be called
    when the AI has a valid target. The implementation likely involves pathfinding
    calculations and spell range validation. Performance may be impacted by complex
    positioning logic, especially in crowded combat scenarios.
  warnings: The method assumes that the target parameter points to a valid target
    entity. Calling with an invalid or null target pointer may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure proper target validation before calling this method.
