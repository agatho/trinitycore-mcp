  method: ReplaceAllAreaTriggerFlags
  signature: void AreaTrigger::ReplaceAllAreaTriggerFlags(AreaTriggerFieldFlags flag)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all flags of the area trigger with the specified flag value.
  description: The ReplaceAllAreaTriggerFlags method updates the internal flag field
    of an AreaTrigger object, replacing all existing flags with a new single flag
    value. This method is typically used to modify the behavior or properties of an
    area trigger, such as its activation conditions, visual effects, or interaction
    rules. The operation directly modifies the area trigger's state in memory and
    may affect how the trigger interacts with players or game entities. This method
    should be used carefully as it completely overwrites any previous flag settings
    without preserving existing values.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The new AreaTriggerFieldFlags value that will replace all current
      flags on the area trigger. This parameter defines the behavior and properties
      of the area trigger, such as whether it's active, visible, or has specific interaction
      rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an Area Trigger to Active State
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Get reference to area trigger

      trigger->ReplaceAllAreaTriggerFlags(AreaTriggerFieldFlags::ACTIVE);

      // The area trigger is now marked as active and will respond to player interactions.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting Area Trigger Flags to Default
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Get reference to area trigger

      trigger->ReplaceAllAreaTriggerFlags(AreaTriggerFieldFlags::NONE);

      // All flags are cleared, effectively disabling the area trigger.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct replacement of all flags and does not merge
    or combine with existing flags. It is recommended to use this method only when
    you intend to completely redefine the trigger's behavior rather than modify individual
    flag bits. The change takes effect immediately in memory but may require synchronization
    with the client if the area trigger is visible to players.
  warnings: Using this method will completely overwrite any existing flags on the
    area trigger, potentially causing loss of previously set behaviors or properties.
    Ensure that the new flag value properly represents the intended state of the area
    trigger before calling this method.
