documentation:
  brief: Sends out-of-range status to a player for this object
  description: This method sends an out-of-range notification to a specified player,
    indicating that the object is no longer within the player's visible range. It
    is used primarily in the context of World of Warcraft's object visibility system,
    where objects are removed from a player's client when they move beyond the visibility
    distance. The method ensures that the player's client properly updates its visibility
    status for this object, which is crucial for maintaining accurate game state and
    preventing ghost objects or incorrect interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Player object to whom the out-of-range notification
      will be sent. This player must be valid and active within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* target = new Player();

      Object* object = new Object();

      object->SendOutOfRangeForPlayer(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with player validation
    code: "if (target && target->IsInWorld()) {\n    object->SendOutOfRangeForPlayer(target);\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Handle invalid player or missing player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called during object removal from visibility, such
    as when an object moves beyond the visibility range or when a player logs out.
    It should be used carefully to avoid performance issues, as sending too many out-of-range
    notifications can cause client-side lag. This method is part of the broader visibility
    system and may be invoked by other methods like Object::UpdateVisibilityState.
  warnings: This method should not be called on objects that are already removed from
    the world or when the player is no longer in the game world, as it could lead
    to memory access violations or invalid client behavior. Additionally, calling
    this method on non-player objects (like creatures or GameObject) may result in
    unexpected behavior.
