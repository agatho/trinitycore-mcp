  signature: void BotThreatManager::ReceiveThreatInformation(int sourceBot, const
    ThreatInfo & info)
documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming threat information from a bot source to update internal
    threat tracking.
  description: The ReceiveThreatInformation method is used by the BotThreatManager
    class to handle and process threat data received from a specific bot source. This
    method updates the internal threat database with new threat values, enabling the
    bot to make informed decisions about target selection and combat behavior. The
    method is typically invoked when another bot in the system broadcasts its current
    threat level or target information. It ensures that all bots maintain synchronized
    threat awareness for coordinated group combat strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: sourceBot
    description: The identifier of the bot sending the threat information. This value
      uniquely identifies which bot is providing the threat data and is used to track
      source-specific threat patterns.
  - name: info
    description: The ThreatInfo object containing detailed threat data including target
      GUID, threat level, and other relevant combat metrics. This structure holds
      all necessary information for updating the threat manager's internal state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic threat information reception
    code: 'BotThreatManager threatManager;

      ThreatInfo info;

      info.targetGuid = 12345;

      info.threatLevel = 500.0f;

      threatManager.ReceiveThreatInformation(42, info);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating threat manager with multiple sources
    code: "BotThreatManager threatManager;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    ThreatInfo\
      \ info;\n    info.targetGuid = 1000 + i;\n    info.threatLevel = 100.0f * i;\n\
      \    threatManager.ReceiveThreatInformation(i, info);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the bot's update loop or
    threat broadcast system. It assumes that the ThreatInfo object passed in contains
    valid data and that the sourceBot identifier is properly registered with the system.
    The method does not perform any validation on the input parameters beyond basic
    type checking.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid sourceBot identifiers may lead to undefined
    behavior or corruption of internal threat tracking data. Ensure that all bot identifiers
    are properly initialized before calling this method. This method should not be
    called from multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization.
