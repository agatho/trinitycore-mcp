  method: IsUsableByLootSpecialization
  signature: bool ItemTemplate::IsUsableByLootSpecialization(const Player * player,
    bool alwaysAllowBoundToAccount) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can use an item based on their loot specialization
    and item requirements.
  description: The IsUsableByLootSpecialization method evaluates if a player is eligible
    to use a specific item according to their current loot specialization settings.
    This method checks various conditions including whether the item is bound to account,
    player's specialization, and other game-specific rules that govern item usability.
    It is primarily used during loot distribution and item usage validation processes
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose loot specialization and eligibility
      are being checked against the item template.
  - name: alwaysAllowBoundToAccount
    description: Boolean flag that determines if items bound to account should be
      allowed for use regardless of specialization. When true, account-bound items
      bypass specialization checks.
  returns: Returns true if the player can use the item based on their loot specialization
    and item requirements; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (itemTemplate->IsUsableByLootSpecialization(player, false)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can use this item\n    player->AddItem(itemTemplate, 1);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Player cannot use this item\n    player->SendEquipError(EQUIP_ERR_ITEM_NOT_READY,\
      \ NULL, NULL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Account-Bound Item Usage
    code: "if (itemTemplate->IsUsableByLootSpecialization(player, true)) {\n    //\
      \ Even if specialization doesn't match, account-bound items are allowed\n  \
      \  player->AddItem(itemTemplate, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during loot distribution or when validating
    item usage. The implementation considers the player's current specialization and
    the item's special requirements. It may also take into account the item's binding
    status and other game rules related to item access.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the 'alwaysAllowBoundToAccount' parameter as it
    can bypass important gameplay restrictions. This should only be used in specific
    scenarios where account-bound items are intentionally allowed regardless of specialization.
