  class: QuestTrigger
  method: Check
  signature: bool QuestTrigger::Check(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a quest trigger condition is met for the given bot AI context.
  description: The Check method determines if a specific quest trigger condition has
    been satisfied within the context of a bot's AI behavior. This method is typically
    used in automated questing systems to decide when certain actions should be taken,
    such as accepting or completing quests. It evaluates internal trigger logic based
    on the current state of the AI and returns true if the trigger conditions are
    met, false otherwise. The method does not modify any state but relies on the provided
    BotAI context for its evaluation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest trigger condition is satisfied in the given AI
    context; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in questing logic
    code: "if (questTrigger.Check(ai)) {\n    // Perform action when trigger is met\n\
      \    ai->DoQuestAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system and should only be called
    within valid bot AI contexts. It is designed to be lightweight and non-blocking,
    making it suitable for frequent checks during AI decision-making loops.
