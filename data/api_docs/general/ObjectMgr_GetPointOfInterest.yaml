documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a point of interest by its unique identifier from the object manager's
    internal database.
  description: The GetPointOfInterest method fetches a PointOfInterest structure from
    the ObjectMgr's internal storage using a provided unique identifier. This method
    is typically used to retrieve quest-related locations or notable landmarks within
    the game world that players can interact with or navigate to. The returned pointer
    provides access to various properties of the point of interest such as its position,
    icon, and associated data. It is important to note that this method does not validate
    whether the ID exists; callers should ensure the ID is valid before invoking this
    function to avoid undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a PointOfInterest object if the specified ID exists
    in the database, otherwise returns nullptr indicating no such point of interest
    was found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Use Point of Interest Data
    code: "const PointOfInterest* poi = sObjectMgr->GetPointOfInterest(12345);\nif\
      \ (poi)\n{\n    // Access POI data\n    uint32 icon = poi->icon;\n    float\
      \ x = poi->x;\n    float y = poi->y;\n    // Use the retrieved information\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal database structures and should be used carefully
    in performance-critical sections. The returned pointer is valid only as long as
    the ObjectMgr instance remains active and the point of interest has not been removed
    from memory.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid ID may result in a null pointer being
    returned, which must be checked before dereferencing. Also, since this is a const
    method, it does not modify any internal state but simply retrieves data.
