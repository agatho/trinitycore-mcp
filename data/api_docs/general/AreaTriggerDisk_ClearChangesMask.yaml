  signature: void AreaTriggerDisk::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the AreaTriggerDisk object, resetting its dirty
    state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of an
    AreaTriggerDisk instance, effectively marking all fields as clean and up-to-date.
    This is typically used after applying or processing changes to ensure that subsequent
    operations do not redundantly process unchanged data. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, area triggers are used for various game mechanics
    such as quest events, spell effects, and interactive zones. The changes mask helps
    optimize network updates by tracking which properties have been modified since
    the last synchronization with clients.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AreaTriggerDisk* trigger = new AreaTriggerDisk();

      // ... modify some properties ...

      trigger->ClearChangesMask(); // Reset the changes mask after processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after applying changes to avoid unnecessary
    reprocessing of unchanged data. It is commonly used in synchronization routines
    where only dirty fields need to be sent to clients.
