documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ActionButton object with default values.
  description: The ActionButton constructor initializes a new instance of the ActionButton
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the action button, including
    default properties such as action type, slot index, and associated spell or item
    information. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this
    constructor is typically called when creating new action buttons for player characters,
    either during character initialization or when dynamically adding new action slots.
    The method ensures that all member variables are properly initialized to their
    default states, preventing undefined behavior when the button is subsequently
    used in the game interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ActionButton instance
    code: 'ActionButton* newButton = new ActionButton();

      // The newButton is now initialized with default values

      // and can be configured for use in the player''s action bar'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when managing player action bars. Developers should not directly instantiate ActionButton
    objects unless specifically required for custom modifications to the action bar
    system. The initialization process includes setting up default values that match
    World of Warcraft's expected action button behavior.
