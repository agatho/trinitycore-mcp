  signature: bool Item::IsArtifactDisabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an artifact item is disabled in the game world.
  description: This method checks if a given artifact item has been disabled within
    the TrinityCore framework, which typically occurs when artifacts are not available
    for use or have been removed from gameplay. The function returns true if the artifact
    is disabled and false otherwise, indicating that the artifact can be used normally.
    This check is important for determining artifact usability and preventing invalid
    operations on disabled items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the artifact item is disabled, false otherwise. A disabled
    artifact typically means it cannot be used or equipped by players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (item->IsArtifactDisabled()) {\n    // Handle disabled artifact\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal state flags or configuration settings
    related to artifact availability. It may be used in conjunction with other artifact-related
    methods to determine overall artifact functionality.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without understanding the artifact's
    current state, as it may lead to incorrect behavior if used inappropriately.
