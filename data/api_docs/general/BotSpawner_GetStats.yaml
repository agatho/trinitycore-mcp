  signature: const SpawnStats & BotSpawner::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spawn statistics of the bot spawner instance
  description: The GetStats method retrieves a constant reference to the SpawnStats
    structure that contains detailed information about the current state and performance
    metrics of the bot spawner. This includes data such as total spawned bots, active
    bots, failed spawns, and other relevant statistics. The returned reference provides
    read-only access to these statistics without allowing modification of the underlying
    data. This method is typically used for monitoring, debugging, or reporting purposes
    within the TrinityCore bot system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a SpawnStats object containing current spawn statistics
    including counts of spawned bots, active bots, and failure metrics
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display spawn statistics
    code: 'const SpawnStats& stats = botSpawner.GetStats();

      std::cout << "Total spawned: " << stats.totalSpawned << ", Active: " << stats.activeBots
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned SpawnStats reference is valid only as long as the BotSpawner
    instance exists. The statistics are updated in real-time during bot spawning operations,
    so calling this method multiple times may yield different results if spawning
    activity occurs between calls.
