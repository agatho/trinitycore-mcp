  method: GetPlayerMetrics
  signature: const ArenaMetrics & ArenaAI::GetPlayerMetrics(uint32 playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the arena metrics associated with a specific player by their GUID.
  description: The GetPlayerMetrics method retrieves a constant reference to the ArenaMetrics
    structure for a given player identified by their unique identifier (GUID). This
    method is typically used within the context of arena gameplay to access player-specific
    statistics and performance data. The returned reference allows read-only access
    to the metrics without modifying them. It's important to note that this method
    assumes the player GUID corresponds to an existing player in the arena system,
    and calling it with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or a crash. The ArenaMetrics structure likely contains information such as match
    wins, losses, rating changes, and other performance indicators relevant to arena
    combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an ArenaMetrics object associated with the specified
    player GUID. This reference provides read-only access to the player's arena statistics
    and performance data. If the player GUID does not correspond to a valid player
    in the arena system, the behavior is undefined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      const ArenaMetrics& metrics = arenaAI->GetPlayerMetrics(playerId);

      // Access metrics data

      uint32 wins = metrics.wins;

      uint32 losses = metrics.losses;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Player Metrics
    code: "uint32 playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nconst ArenaMetrics&\
      \ playerMetrics = arenaAI->GetPlayerMetrics(playerId);\nif (playerMetrics.wins\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Player has won at least one match\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player %u has %u wins.\", playerId, playerMetrics.wins);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a lookup table or map structure to
    quickly retrieve player metrics by GUID. Performance considerations should be
    taken into account when calling this method frequently during gameplay loops.
    The returned reference is valid only as long as the ArenaAI instance and its internal
    data structures remain valid.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID may lead
    to undefined behavior or application crashes. Ensure that the player GUID is valid
    and corresponds to a registered arena player before invoking this method. The
    returned reference should not be stored for extended periods as it may become
    invalid if the underlying data structure changes.
