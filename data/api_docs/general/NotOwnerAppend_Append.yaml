documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet for non-owners.
  description: The NotOwnerAppend::Append method is responsible for populating a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with relevant data specific to users who are not owners of a channel. This
    method ensures that non-owner users receive appropriate channel-related notifications,
    such as join/leave messages or role changes, without having elevated privileges.
    It typically operates within the context of TrinityCore's channel management system
    and is used during packet construction for client communication. The method modifies
    the provided packet in-place and does not return any value.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet that
      will be populated with notification data specific to non-owner users.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in channel handling
    code: 'WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      NotOwnerAppend appendHandler;

      appendHandler.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal packet construction logic for channel
    notifications in TrinityCore. It should only be called when handling non-owner
    user interactions with channels, and assumes that the caller has already validated
    the context.
