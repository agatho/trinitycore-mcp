  brief: Updates the demonology demon tracker state and internal timers.

    the DemonologyDemonTracker, including updating cooldowns, tracking demon summoning
    events, and managing the lifecycle of summoned demons. This method is typically
    called every game tick or frame to ensure that the demon tracker accurately reflects
    the current state of the player's demonology abilities and summoned creatures.

    duration of active demon effects, and preparing for the next potential summoning
    event.
