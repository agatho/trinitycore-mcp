api:
  class: DruidAI
  method: HasEnoughEnergy
  signature: bool DruidAI::HasEnoughEnergy(int amount) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Druid AI has sufficient energy to cast a spell with the specified
    cost.
  description: The HasEnoughEnergy method evaluates whether the current Druid AI unit
    possesses enough energy (mana, rage, or focus) to execute a spell or ability that
    requires a specific energy amount. This method is typically used during AI decision-making
    processes to determine spell viability before attempting to cast. The check considers
    the unit's current energy reserves against the provided energy requirement. This
    functionality is crucial for proper spell selection and resource management in
    Druid AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The required energy amount needed to cast the intended spell or ability.
      This value represents the energy cost in the game's energy system (mana, rage,
      or focus depending on the druid form).
  returns: Returns true if the Druid AI unit has equal to or more than the specified
    energy amount; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Energy Check
    code: "if (druidAI->HasEnoughEnergy(50)) {\n    // Cast a spell that costs 50\
      \ energy\n    druidAI->CastSpell(SpellId::Moonfire);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "if (druidAI->HasEnoughEnergy(100) && druidAI->GetTarget()) {\n    // Cast\
      \ Hurricane if enough energy and target exists\n    druidAI->CastSpell(SpellId::Hurricane);\n\
      } else {\n    // Otherwise, try a cheaper spell\n    druidAI->CastSpell(SpellId::Wrath);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before attempting to cast spells that require
    energy to avoid failed casts. The energy amount is typically retrieved from spell
    data or calculated based on the spell's energy cost. This check does not account
    for any temporary energy modifiers or buffs that might affect the unit's current
    energy pool.
  warnings: Ensure that the energy amount parameter accurately reflects the actual
    spell cost, as incorrect values will lead to invalid AI behavior. This method
    may not consider energy regeneration rates or other dynamic factors affecting
    energy availability in real-time.
