  method: ShouldUseConsumables
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ShouldUseConsumables() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the adaptive behavior manager should use consumables based
    on current player state and AI logic.
  description: The ShouldUseConsumables method evaluates the current state of the
    player character and associated AI behavior to decide if it is appropriate to
    consume items such as potions, food, or other consumable resources. This decision
    is typically made in the context of combat or non-combat scenarios where resource
    management plays a key role in maintaining optimal performance. The method considers
    factors like health, mana levels, buff status, and environmental conditions to
    make this determination. It is commonly used within the adaptive behavior system
    to dynamically adjust player actions based on situational awareness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the adaptive behavior manager determines that using consumables
    would be beneficial or necessary; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.ShouldUseConsumables()) {\n    // Trigger consumable\
      \ usage logic\n    player.UseConsumable(CONSUMABLE_POTION);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void PlayerAI::Update()\n{\n    if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.ShouldUseConsumables())\n\
      \    {\n        if (player.GetHealthPercent() < 30)\n            player.UseConsumable(CONSUMABLE_HEALTH_POTION);\n\
      \        else if (player.GetManaPercent() < 20)\n            player.UseConsumable(CONSUMABLE_MANA_POTION);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an adaptive AI system that evaluates dynamic conditions
    to make intelligent decisions about resource usage. It may be called frequently
    during gameplay updates, so performance optimization is important. The logic behind
    this decision should consider the player's current class, specialization, and
    gear loadout for accurate behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that calling this method does not cause unintended side effects
    in your AI logic. Misuse of consumable usage decisions could lead to inefficient
    resource consumption or inappropriate behavior during critical moments like boss
    fights.
