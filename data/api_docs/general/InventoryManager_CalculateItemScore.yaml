documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a normalized score for an item based on its stats
    and quality.
  description: The CalculateItemScore method computes a floating-point value that
    represents the overall strength or desirability of an Item within the context
    of World of Warcraft's inventory system. This score is typically used for AI decision-making,
    item comparison, and inventory management logic. The calculation considers various
    item attributes such as stat values, quality level, enchantments, and other relevant
    properties to produce a single normalized metric. The method does not modify the
    item itself but rather evaluates its characteristics to determine its relative
    value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated item score. Higher scores indicate
    more valuable or desirable items. The exact scale and interpretation of this score
    may vary depending on implementation details within TrinityCore's item evaluation
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Item* myItem = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, SLOT_HEAD);\n\
      float score = inventoryManager->CalculateItemScore(myItem);\nif (score > 10.0f)\
      \ {\n    // Item is considered high-value\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Item Scores
    code: "Item* item1 = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, SLOT_CHEST);\n\
      Item* item2 = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, SLOT_LEGS);\nfloat\
      \ score1 = inventoryManager->CalculateItemScore(item1);\nfloat score2 = inventoryManager->CalculateItemScore(item2);\n\
      if (score1 > score2) {\n    // item1 is considered better than item2\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal scoring algorithms that take into account
    item level, stat weights, gem bonuses, enchantments, and other factors. The exact
    implementation details are not publicly exposed but are part of TrinityCore's
    core inventory management logic. Performance is generally acceptable for single-item
    evaluations but may become noticeable when processing large numbers of items.
  warnings: Ensure that the Item pointer passed to this method is valid and not null;
    passing an invalid pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    The returned score should not be used as a direct measure of item worth in monetary
    terms, as it's designed for relative comparisons within the game context.
