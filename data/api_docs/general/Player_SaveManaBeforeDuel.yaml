documentation:
  brief: Saves the player's current mana value before entering a duel.
  description: The SaveManaBeforeDuel method stores the player's current mana amount
    in a temporary variable or member field, typically used to preserve the mana state
    before a duel begins. This allows the player's mana to be restored to its original
    value after the duel concludes, ensuring that mana consumed during the duel does
    not permanently affect the player's resource pool. The method is usually invoked
    automatically by the game engine when a duel is initiated, and it helps maintain
    game balance by preventing mana loss from duel-related actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic usage during duel setup
    code: "void Player::HandleDuelRequest(Player* opponent)\n{\n    // Save current\
      \ mana before starting the duel\n    SaveManaBeforeDuel();\n    \n    // Proceed\
      \ with duel initialization logic\n    SendDuelArbiterInitiated();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a duel is about to begin. It's part of the duel system's resource management and
    should not be manually invoked unless implementing custom duel logic. The saved
    mana value is usually restored via another internal method like RestoreManaAfterDuel().
  warnings: Do not call this method directly in custom scripts or modifications without
    understanding its role in the duel lifecycle. Incorrect usage may lead to mana
    state inconsistencies or unexpected behavior during duels.
