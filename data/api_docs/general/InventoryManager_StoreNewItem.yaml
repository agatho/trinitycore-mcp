  method: StoreNewItem
  signature: bool InventoryManager::StoreNewItem(uint32 itemId, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Stores a specified item in the player's inventory, returning true if successful.
  description: The StoreNewItem method attempts to add a specified item to the player's
    inventory. It handles item stacking, container management, and inventory space
    checks. The method will attempt to place the item in existing stacks first before
    creating new slots. If the item cannot be added due to inventory constraints or
    other issues, it returns false. This method is commonly used for quest rewards,
    loot drops, and item grants within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully stored in the inventory, false
    otherwise. Failure can occur due to insufficient inventory space, invalid item
    ID, or other constraint violations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Storage
    code: "if (player->GetInventory()->StoreNewItem(12345, 1)) {\n    // Item successfully\
      \ added\n    player->SendNotification(\"Item received!\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Failed to add item\n    player->SendNotification(\"Failed to receive item.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Item Storage
    code: "uint32 itemCount = 10;\nif (player->GetInventory()->StoreNewItem(67890,\
      \ itemCount)) {\n    player->SendNotification(\"Received %u items!\", itemCount);\n\
      } else {\n    player->SendNotification(\"Could not receive all items.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method automatically handles item stacking and container logic. It respects
    inventory limits and will attempt to distribute items across multiple containers
    when necessary. The method does not perform any validation on the item ID beyond
    basic existence checks.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with invalid item IDs as it may cause
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate item IDs before calling this method
    in production code. Be aware that this method may split items across multiple
    containers if the stack size is exceeded.
