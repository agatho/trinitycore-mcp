api:
  class: CooldownManager
  method: StartChanneling
  signature: void CooldownManager::StartChanneling(uint32 spellId, uint32 channelDurationMs)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the channeling state for a specified spell with a given duration.
  description: The StartChanneling method begins the channeling process for a spell
    by setting up the necessary cooldown and channeling timers. This method is typically
    invoked when a player or creature starts casting a channeled spell, such as Drain
    Life or Healing Stream Totem. It ensures that the spell's channeling duration
    is properly tracked and that the caster cannot cast other spells until the channeling
    completes or is interrupted. The method updates internal state to reflect the
    active channeling period and may interact with the cooldown system to prevent
    immediate re-casting of the same spell.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being channeled. This ID must
      correspond to a valid channeled spell in the game's spell database.
  - name: channelDurationMs
    description: The duration of the channeling in milliseconds. This determines how
      long the spell will remain in the active channeling state before completing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Channeling Start
    code: 'CooldownManager* cooldownMgr = player->GetCooldownManager();

      cooldownMgr->StartChanneling(1822, 5000); // Start channeling Drain Life for
      5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Channeling with Dynamic Duration
    code: 'uint32 spellId = 526; // Healing Stream Totem

      uint32 duration = 10000; // 10 seconds

      cooldownMgr->StartChanneling(spellId, duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a spell is actually beginning its
    channeling phase. It does not validate whether the caster has the required mana
    or resources to start the spell. The cooldown manager will handle internal tracking
    of the channeling state and ensure that subsequent attempts to cast the same spell
    are properly delayed.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in incorrect
    behavior, such as allowing multiple simultaneous channeling effects or bypassing
    cooldown restrictions. Ensure that the spell ID corresponds to a valid channeled
    spell before calling this function.
