  class: AdaptiveDifficulty

  signature: std::shared_ptr<PlayerSkillProfile> AdaptiveDifficulty::GetPlayerProfile(int
    guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the skill profile associated with a player identified by their
    GUID.
  description: The GetPlayerProfile method fetches the PlayerSkillProfile shared pointer
    for a specific player using their globally unique identifier (GUID). This method
    is typically used in adaptive difficulty systems to tailor game content based
    on individual player capabilities. The returned profile contains data about the
    player's skill level, progression, and other relevant attributes that influence
    how challenges are adjusted. It is important to note that this method assumes
    the player exists within the system and has a valid profile; otherwise, it may
    return a null pointer or throw an exception depending on implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier of the player whose skill profile
      is to be retrieved. This value uniquely identifies each player in the game world.
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<PlayerSkillProfile> pointing to the player's skill profile
    if found, or a null pointer if no such profile exists for the given GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "std::shared_ptr<PlayerSkillProfile> profile = adaptiveDifficulty->GetPlayerProfile(12345);\n\
      if (profile)\n{\n    // Use the player's skill profile\n    std::cout << \"\
      Player skill level: \" << profile->GetSkillLevel() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "auto profile = adaptiveDifficulty->GetPlayerProfile(playerGuid);\nif (!profile)\n\
      {\n    // Handle case where player profile does not exist\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      world\", \"No skill profile found for player GUID: {}\", playerGuid);\n    return;\n\
      }\n// Proceed with using the retrieved profile\nint level = profile->GetSkillLevel();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe if the underlying data structures are properly
    synchronized. It is recommended to cache results when frequently accessed to avoid
    repeated lookups. The PlayerSkillProfile object returned should not be modified
    directly unless explicitly designed for such use.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or exceptions depending on the implementation. Ensure that
    the player GUID is valid before calling this function.
