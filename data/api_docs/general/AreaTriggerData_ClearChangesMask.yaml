  method: ClearChangesMask
  signature: void AreaTriggerData::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the area trigger data, resetting its modified
    state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of an
    AreaTriggerData object, effectively marking all fields as unmodified. This is
    typically used after applying or processing changes to ensure that subsequent
    modifications can be properly tracked. In the context of TrinityCore's World of
    Warcraft emulation, area triggers are used for various game mechanics such as
    quest events, spell effects, and instance boundaries. The changes mask helps optimize
    network updates by tracking which fields have been modified since the last update
    was sent to clients.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AreaTriggerData* triggerData = new AreaTriggerData();

      // ... modify some fields ...

      triggerData->ClearChangesMask(); // Reset the changes mask after processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after applying changes to avoid sending stale
    or redundant updates. It's commonly used in conjunction with methods that check
    the changes mask to determine what data needs to be synchronized with clients.
