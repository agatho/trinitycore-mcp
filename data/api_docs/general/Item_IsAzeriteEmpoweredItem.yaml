documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is an Azerite empowered item.
  description: This method checks if the current item has been empowered with Azerite,
    which is a special type of item introduced in World of Warcraft's Legion expansion.
    Azerite items are characterized by their unique properties and ability to be upgraded
    through Azerite powers. The method returns true if the item is an Azerite empowered
    item, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for identifying items that
    can benefit from Azerite-related mechanics such as Azerite traits and upgrades.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is an Azerite empowered item, false otherwise.
    The method does not distinguish between different types of Azerite items; it simply
    confirms whether the item has been empowered with Azerite.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemBySlot(1); // Get equipped item\nif (item &&\
      \ item->IsAzeriteEmpoweredItem()) {\n    // Item is Azerite empowered\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal item data structures that may vary depending
    on the game version. It's recommended to use this method in conjunction with other
    Azerite-related methods for comprehensive Azerite item detection.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole indicator of Azerite item status,
    as it only confirms whether an item has been empowered with Azerite, not the specific
    Azerite power or level. It's important to note that Azerite items are typically
    obtained through specific questlines and may require additional checks for full
    functionality.
