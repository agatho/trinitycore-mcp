documentation:
  brief: Releases an empowered spell from the evoker's current spell queue.
  description: The ReleaseEmpoweredSpell method is responsible for releasing a spell
    that has been empowered by the Evoker class. This typically occurs when an evoker
    has accumulated sufficient magical energy or met specific conditions to empower
    a spell, and it's time to cast or release that empowered state. The method likely
    manages the transition of the spell from an empowered state back to a normal casting
    state or removes it from the active queue. It may also handle cleanup operations
    such as resetting internal counters or flags related to empowered spells.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_empoweredSpellTimer <= diff)\n    {\n        ReleaseEmpoweredSpell();\n\
      \        m_empoweredSpellTimer = 0;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger spell management system within the
    EvokerAI class. It may be called during AI update cycles or in response to specific
    events such as energy accumulation or spell activation triggers.
