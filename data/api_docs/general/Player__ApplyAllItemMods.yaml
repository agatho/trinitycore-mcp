  brief: Applies all item mods to the player's attributes and stats
  description: This method applies all item modifiers to the player's character attributes
    and stats, ensuring that all equipped items are properly accounted for in the
    player's overall stats. It is typically called during character loading or when
    items are equipped/unequipped to maintain accurate stat calculations. The method
    ensures that all item bonuses from equipped gear are correctly applied to the
    player's base stats, including strength, agility, intellect, and other relevant
    attributes.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_ApplyAllItemMods();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during character loading process
    and when items are equipped or unequipped. It may be called multiple times during
    gameplay, particularly when switching between different sets of gear. Performance
    considerations include potential overhead from recalculating all stats when items
    change.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases as it's usually
    invoked automatically by the game engine. Calling it manually could lead to duplicate
    application of item mods and incorrect stat calculations. Avoid calling this method
    during combat or while in a state that might affect item calculations.
