  signature: void SocialManager::TrackChat(const std::string & message)
documentation:
  brief: Records a chat message for social tracking purposes within the game.
  description: The TrackChat method is used to log or monitor chat messages sent by
    players in the World of Warcraft environment. This functionality is typically
    employed for social interaction logging, moderation purposes, or maintaining player
    behavior records. The method accepts a string parameter representing the chat
    message content and processes it according to the server's social tracking configuration.
    It does not modify the message itself but rather ensures that it is captured and
    potentially stored for later analysis or display.
  parameters:
  - name: message
    description: The chat message content to be tracked. This string represents the
      full text of the message sent by a player, including any formatting or special
      characters that may be present.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chat Tracking
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = sSocialMgr;

      std::string chatMessage = "Hello everyone!";

      socialMgr->TrackChat(chatMessage);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Player Chat with Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerChat(Player* player, std::string& message) {\n    // Log\
      \ the chat for social tracking\n    sSocialMgr->TrackChat(message);\n    //\
      \ Proceed with normal chat handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger social management system that may
    integrate with other subsystems like player behavior monitoring, anti-spam systems,
    or administrative tools. The actual implementation details regarding storage location
    and processing pipeline are not specified here.
  warnings: Ensure that chat tracking does not violate privacy policies or player
    expectations. This method should be used responsibly in accordance with game rules
    and server configurations.
