  class: PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
  method: BeginTransaction
  signature: int PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::BeginTransaction()
documentation:
  brief: Begins a database transaction for player bot character operations
  description: Initiates a database transaction within the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
    class to group multiple database operations into a single atomic unit. This method
    ensures data consistency when performing related updates, inserts, or deletes
    on player bot character data. The transaction must be explicitly committed or
    rolled back using corresponding methods. This is essential for maintaining database
    integrity during complex player bot character modifications that involve multiple
    tables or records.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns 0 on successful transaction begin, or a non-zero error code indicating
    failure to start the transaction. Common error codes may include database connection
    issues or transaction already in progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Transaction Usage
    code: "PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface dbInterface;\nint result = dbInterface.BeginTransaction();\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Proceed with database operations\n    // ... perform\
      \ multiple operations ...\n    // Commit or rollback transaction\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle transaction begin failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a database connection is established
    and active. Multiple consecutive calls without proper commit/rollback may result
    in transaction conflicts or errors. The transaction remains active until explicitly
    committed or rolled back, potentially blocking other operations on the same database
    connection.
  warnings: Failing to properly commit or rollback transactions can lead to database
    locks, inconsistent data states, or connection timeouts. Always ensure that every
    BeginTransaction() call is matched with either CommitTransaction() or RollbackTransaction()
    to prevent resource leaks and maintain database integrity.
