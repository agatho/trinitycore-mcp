documentation:
  brief: Manages patrol behavior avoidance for AI units in TrinityCore.
  description: The HandlePatrolAvoidance method is responsible for implementing avoidance
    logic during patrol behaviors in the AdvancedBehaviorManager. This method ensures
    that AI units will avoid certain areas or objects while following their patrol
    routes, preventing them from getting stuck or entering invalid zones. It typically
    checks for obstacles, terrain restrictions, or other environmental factors that
    would impede normal movement during patrol sequences. The method integrates with
    the core AI system to dynamically adjust patrol paths based on real-time environmental
    data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Patrol Avoidance Usage
    code: "void MyAIUnit::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    m_behaviorManager->HandlePatrolAvoidance();\n    // ... continue with patrol\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked regularly to maintain proper patrol behavior. It may modify internal state
    variables related to patrol waypoints or movement targets. The implementation
    likely uses collision detection or pathfinding algorithms to determine avoidance
    paths.
  warnings: Improper use of this method in conjunction with manual waypoint manipulation
    can cause unpredictable patrol behavior. Ensure that patrol points are properly
    validated before calling this method to avoid potential infinite loops or invalid
    navigation states.
