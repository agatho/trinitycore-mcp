  brief: Clears all tracking data for LFG bots within the selector.

    related to LFG (Looking for Group) bots managed by this LFGBotSelector instance.
    This includes any internal state, player associations, or group tracking that
    may have been accumulated during previous operations. The method ensures a clean
    slate for subsequent LFG bot selection processes, making it useful when resetting
    the selector's state before initiating new searches or when cleaning up after

  notes: This method should be called before initiating new LFG searches to ensure
    no stale data affects the selection process. It is typically used in conjunction
    with other selector methods to maintain a consistent and accurate state.
