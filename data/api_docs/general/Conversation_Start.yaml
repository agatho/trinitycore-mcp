  class: Conversation
  method: Start
  signature: bool Conversation::Start()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a conversation with the player, returning true if successful.
  description: The Start method begins a conversation sequence for the current Conversation
    object. It initializes the conversation state and prepares the necessary data
    structures to display dialogue options or narrative content to the player. This
    method typically checks if the conversation can be started based on prerequisites
    such as quest status, player level, or relationship with NPCs. The method returns
    true if the conversation successfully begins, and false if it fails due to invalid
    conditions or already active states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the conversation was successfully initiated; otherwise
    returns false if the conversation could not be started due to preconditions not
    being met or other errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Conversation Start
    code: "if (conversation.Start()) {\n    // Conversation has begun successfully\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Conversation started successfully.\");\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Failed to start conversation\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to start conversation.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Conversation object is properly
    initialized and associated with a valid player or NPC. It may internally trigger
    related events such as quest updates or UI notifications depending on how the
    conversation is configured.
  warnings: Calling Start() on an already active conversation may result in unexpected
    behavior or failure to start. Ensure that any previous conversation state is properly
    cleaned up before invoking this method.
