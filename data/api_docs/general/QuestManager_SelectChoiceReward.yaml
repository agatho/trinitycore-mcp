documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the ID of the chosen reward option from a quest's choice
    rewards.
  description: The SelectChoiceReward method determines which reward option was selected
    by the player for a quest that offers multiple reward choices. This method is
    typically invoked when processing quest completion to identify the specific reward
    the player chose from a set of available options. It evaluates the quest data
    and returns the unique identifier (ID) corresponding to the selected choice reward,
    allowing the game to properly award the chosen item or currency. The method assumes
    that the quest has been properly initialized with choice rewards and that the
    player's selection has been recorded within the quest's state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the ID of the selected choice reward.
    This ID corresponds to an entry in the quest's reward choice table, indicating
    which specific reward option was chosen by the player. If no choice reward is
    selected or if the quest does not have choice rewards, the method may return 0
    or an invalid ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 selectedRewardId = questManager.SelectChoiceReward(quest);\nif (selectedRewardId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the selected reward\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"player.quest\"\
      , \"Player selected reward ID: %u\", selectedRewardId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Quest Completion
    code: "void Player::CompleteQuest(Quest const* quest)\n{\n    uint32 choiceRewardId\
      \ = GetQuestManager().SelectChoiceReward(quest);\n    if (choiceRewardId > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // Award the selected reward\n        RewardChoiceItem(choiceRewardId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest management system and relies on internal
    quest state tracking. It should only be called after a player has made their choice
    in a quest with multiple reward options. The implementation likely accesses internal
    data structures that store the player's selected reward choice.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest passed to this method actually contains choice rewards,
    otherwise the return value may not be meaningful. Calling this method on a quest
    without choice rewards could lead to incorrect behavior or invalid reward assignment.
