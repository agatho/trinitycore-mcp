  method: DoUpdate
  signature: void BehaviorManager::DoUpdate(uint32 elapsed)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active AI behaviors for the current tick cycle
  description: The DoUpdate method is responsible for executing the core update logic
    of all registered AI behaviors within the BehaviorManager. This method is typically
    called once per game tick and processes each behavior's update routine, handling
    state transitions, decision making, and action execution based on elapsed time.
    It serves as the central coordination point for AI behavior management in TrinityCore's
    AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: elapsed
    description: The time elapsed since the last update cycle, measured in milliseconds.
      This value is used by behaviors to determine how much time has passed and adjust
      their logic accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Behavior Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_behaviorManager)\n\
      \        m_behaviorManager->DoUpdate(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Behavior Update with Error Handling
    code: "void WorldObject::UpdateBehaviors(uint32 elapsed)\n{\n    if (!m_behaviorManager)\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    try\n    {\n        m_behaviorManager->DoUpdate(elapsed);\n\
      \    }\n    catch (const std::exception& e)\n    {\n        // Log error and\
      \ continue processing\n        sLog->outError(\"Behavior update failed: %s\"\
      , e.what());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from the main game loop and should not block for extended
    periods. The elapsed time parameter is crucial for maintaining consistent behavior
    timing across different server loads. BehaviorManager may internally manage multiple
    behaviors with varying update frequencies.
  warnings: Calling DoUpdate without proper initialization of the BehaviorManager
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that all behaviors
    have been properly registered and initialized before execution.
