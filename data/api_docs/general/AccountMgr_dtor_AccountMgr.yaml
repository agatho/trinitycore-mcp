  method: ~AccountMgr
  signature: void AccountMgr::~AccountMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AccountMgr instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The AccountMgr destructor is responsible for cleaning up any dynamically
    allocated memory or resources held by the AccountMgr singleton instance. In TrinityCore,
    this typically involves releasing internal data structures, closing database connections,
    or performing other necessary cleanup operations to ensure no memory leaks occur
    when the account management system is shut down. This method is automatically
    invoked when the AccountMgr singleton goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AccountMgr singleton
    code: "int main() {\n    // AccountMgr is created as a singleton\n    // ...\n\
      \    // At program exit, the destructor is automatically called\n    return\
      \ 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The AccountMgr class is typically implemented as a singleton, meaning there
    should only be one instance at any time. The destructor ensures proper cleanup
    of all internal resources and should not be called manually unless explicitly
    managing the singleton lifecycle.
