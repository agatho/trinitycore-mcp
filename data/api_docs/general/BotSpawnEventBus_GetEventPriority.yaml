documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the execution priority value for a specified bot spawn event type.
  description: The GetEventPriority method returns the configured priority level assigned
    to a specific bot spawn event type within the TrinityCore framework. This priority
    determines the order in which events are processed when multiple bot spawn events
    occur simultaneously. The method is typically used by the event bus system to
    sort and dispatch events appropriately based on their defined importance or urgency.
    It operates as a lookup function that maps event types to their corresponding
    priority values, ensuring proper sequencing of bot-related activities such as
    spawning, despawning, or repositioning within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the priority level assigned to the specified
    bot spawn event type. Higher numerical values indicate higher priority, with 0
    typically representing the lowest priority or default priority level.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Priority for Spawn Event
    code: 'uint32 priority = eventBus.GetEventPriority(BotSpawnEventType::BOT_SPAWN_EVENT_SPAWN);

      // Returns the priority assigned to spawn events, e.g., 100'
    language: cpp
  - title: Compare Event Priorities
    code: "uint32 spawnPriority = eventBus.GetEventPriority(BotSpawnEventType::BOT_SPAWN_EVENT_SPAWN);\n\
      uint32 despawnPriority = eventBus.GetEventPriority(BotSpawnEventType::BOT_SPAWN_EVENT_DESPAWN);\n\
      if (spawnPriority > despawnPriority) {\n    // Handle spawn events before despawn\
      \ events\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented as a lookup table or map-based system for
    efficient retrieval. The priority values are typically configured through configuration
    files or runtime settings, allowing administrators to adjust event processing
    order without modifying core code.
  warnings: Ensure that event types passed to this method are valid and registered
    within the system, as invalid types may return unexpected or default priority
    values. Misconfigured priorities can lead to incorrect event ordering in bot management
    systems.
