  signature: bool GroupInvitationHandler::AcceptInvitationInternal(int inviterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and accepts a group invitation from a specified player GUID
  description: The AcceptInvitationInternal method handles the internal logic for
    accepting a group invitation sent by another player. It validates the invitation,
    ensures the inviter is still valid and in a state where an invitation can be accepted,
    and attempts to add the current player to the inviting player's group. This method
    is typically called as part of the group invitation flow when a player chooses
    to accept an invitation received from another player. The method returns true
    if the invitation was successfully processed and the player was added to the group,
    or false if the operation failed due to invalid state, expired invitation, or
    other issues.
  parameters:
  - name: inviterGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the player who sent the
      group invitation. This value must correspond to a valid online player in the
      game world.
  returns: True if the invitation was successfully accepted and the player was added
    to the inviter's group; false otherwise, which may occur due to invalid GUID,
    expired invitation, or other failure conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Accepting a Group Invitation
    code: "if (groupHandler->AcceptInvitationInternal(12345)) {\n    // Player successfully\
      \ joined the group\n    sLog->outString(\"Player accepted group invitation from\
      \ player with GUID 12345\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to accept the invitation\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Failed to accept group invitation from player with GUID\
      \ 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal group management system and should not
    be called directly by external modules. It assumes that the calling context has
    already validated that the current player is eligible to join a group. The method
    may perform checks such as ensuring the inviter is in the same map, not in a combat
    state, or not already in another group.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the player is already in a group
    before attempting to accept an invitation. If called while the player is already
    in a group, it may result in unexpected behavior or errors depending on the server's
    group handling logic. Always ensure proper state checks are performed before calling
    this method.
