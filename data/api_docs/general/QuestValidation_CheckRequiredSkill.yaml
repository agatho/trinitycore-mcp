  class: QuestValidation
  method: CheckRequiredSkill
  signature: bool QuestValidation::CheckRequiredSkill(const Quest * quest, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has the required skill level to accept a quest.
  description: The CheckRequiredSkill method validates whether a given player possesses
    the necessary skill requirements to accept and progress through a specified quest.
    This validation is crucial in World of Warcraft's quest system, ensuring that
    players meet prerequisites such as minimum skill levels in professions or abilities
    before they can engage with certain quests. The method typically checks against
    the quest's required skill ID and minimum skill value defined in the quest template.
    It returns true if the player meets all skill requirements, false otherwise. This
    check is often performed during quest acceptance and may be part of a broader
    validation process for quest eligibility.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that contains the required skill information.
      Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose skills are being validated against
      the quest requirements. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player has the required skill level or higher, false
    if the player does not meet the minimum skill requirement for the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Skill Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::CheckRequiredSkill(quest, player)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can accept and progress with the quest\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Player lacks required skill level\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not have the required skill to take this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's skill database and the quest's
    template data. It may be called during quest acceptance, quest update checks,
    or when a player attempts to interact with quest givers. The implementation might
    cache skill information for performance reasons.
  warnings: Ensure both parameters are valid non-null pointers before calling this
    method. Passing null pointers will likely result in crashes or undefined behavior.
    This method should not be used as the sole validation for quest acceptance, as
    other conditions like quest level requirements and reputation may also apply.
