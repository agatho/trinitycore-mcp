documentation:
  brief: Updates the social manager's internal state and processes pending social
    actions.
  description: The Update method in SocialManager is responsible for maintaining the
    player's social list state, processing queued social actions such as friend requests
    or ignores, and synchronizing social data with the game server. This method is
    typically called every game tick to ensure that all social interactions are handled
    in a timely manner. It manages the internal timers and states of social relationships,
    ensuring that players can properly interact with their friends, ignore lists,
    and other social features within the game world.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\n\
      \    sSocialMgr->Update(diff);\n    // ... other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked from the main game loop and should not be
    called directly by external systems. The 'diff' parameter represents the time
    elapsed since the last update in milliseconds, which is used to manage timing-sensitive
    social operations such as cooldowns or timeouts.
