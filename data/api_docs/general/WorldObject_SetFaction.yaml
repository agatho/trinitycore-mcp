api:
  class: WorldObject
  method: SetFaction
  signature: void WorldObject::SetFaction(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the faction ID for this WorldObject, affecting its relationships with
    other objects in the game world.
  description: The SetFaction method assigns a new faction ID to the WorldObject,
    which determines how the object interacts with others based on faction relations.
    This change affects hostility, friendship, and communication behaviors within
    the game world. The faction ID is typically sourced from the creature_template
    or gameobject_template tables in the database. When called, this method updates
    internal faction data structures and may trigger visual or behavioral changes
    depending on the new faction assignment. It's commonly used during creature spawning,
    quest events, or scripted interactions where an object's faction needs to be dynamically
    altered.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The faction ID to assign to this WorldObject. This value must correspond
      to a valid faction entry in the database's faction_template table.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Player Faction to Neutral
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SetFaction(35); // Set to Neutral faction'
    language: cpp
  - title: Change Creature Faction During Quest
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->SetFaction(14); // Change to Alliance faction

      creature->AI()->AttackStart(player); // Begin attacking player if they''re hostile'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately update the client's view of the object.
    The visual representation and faction-related behaviors will be synchronized with
    the client on the next update cycle. For immediate visual feedback, consider calling
    SendUpdateToPlayer() after setting the faction.
  warnings: Setting an invalid or non-existent faction ID may cause undefined behavior
    or errors in faction-based interactions. Always ensure that the faction ID corresponds
    to a valid entry in the database before calling this method.
