  brief: Initializes default AI triggers for a bot AI instance
  description: The InitializeDefaultTriggers method sets up the standard set of AI
    triggers that govern a bot's behavior within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    configures the core decision-making logic for the bot, including combat behaviors,
    movement patterns, and interaction responses. It is typically called during the
    initialization phase of a bot AI instance to ensure all necessary triggers are
    registered and active. The method does not accept any parameters and operates
    on the provided BotAI instance directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();

      botAI->InitializeDefaultTriggers(botAI);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per BotAI instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may result in duplicate trigger registrations or undefined behavior.
    The method assumes that the BotAI instance has been properly constructed and is
    in a valid state.
  warnings: Do not call this method on an uninitialized BotAI object as it may lead
    to segmentation faults or other memory access violations. Ensure the BotAI pointer
    is valid before invoking this method.
