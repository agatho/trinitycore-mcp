  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void OutlawRogueRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the outlaw rogue's single-target rotation logic for the current
    target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core decision-making
    logic for an outlaw rogue class in TrinityCore. It evaluates the player's current
    state, available abilities, and combat conditions to determine the optimal sequence
    of actions against a single target. This method typically manages combo point
    generation, ability prioritization, and resource management specific to the outlaw
    rogue specialization. The method operates on the target specified by the input
    parameter and may modify the player's action queue or spell casting behavior accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      in the combat system. This parameter specifies which enemy unit the rotation
      logic should apply to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      outlawRogue->ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Manager
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    if (player->getClass() == CLASS_ROGUE && player->getSubClass()\
      \ == ROGUE_OUTLAW)\n    {\n        int currentTarget = player->GetVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \        outlawRogueRefactored.ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&currentTarget);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle in combat situations.
    It assumes that the target parameter points to a valid enemy unit and that the
    rogue has sufficient resources (energy, combo points) to execute abilities. The
    implementation may involve complex state checks including weapon availability,
    buff/debuff status, and positioning requirements.
  warnings: The method expects a valid target pointer; passing NULL or an invalid
    target ID may result in undefined behavior. This function should only be called
    during active combat scenarios where the rogue has a valid target. Improper usage
    can lead to incorrect rotation execution or potential client/server desynchronization.
