documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CombatStateAnalyzer instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CombatStateAnalyzer class is responsible for
    releasing any memory or system resources that were allocated during the object's
    lifetime. This method ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures, such
    as combat logs, state tracking variables, or any dynamically allocated buffers
    used to monitor player or creature combat behavior. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this destructor plays a key role in maintaining memory
    efficiency and preventing resource leaks when combat state analyzers are removed
    from memory, particularly during player logout, creature death, or server shutdown
    scenarios.

  - title: Automatic destruction of CombatStateAnalyzer
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;\n    // ... use\
      \ analyzer ...\n    // analyzer is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless explicitly managing object
    lifecycle through raw pointers. It is typically invoked automatically when the
    object goes out of scope or is deleted. TrinityCore's memory management system
    handles most cleanup operations, but developers must ensure that no external references
    to the analyzer remain after destruction.
