  brief: Loads and initializes creature quest starter data from the database into
    memory.
  description: The LoadCreatureQuestStarters method is responsible for loading all
    creature quest starter entries from the database tables into internal memory structures.
    This method ensures that creatures are properly linked to their associated quests,
    allowing players to initiate quests by interacting with specific NPCs. It typically
    runs during server startup or database reload operations to populate the necessary
    data structures for quest system functionality. The method processes the relationship
    between creatures and quests, enabling proper quest tracking and progression when
    players interact with eligible NPCs.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadQuestData()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadCreatureQuestStarters();\n\
      \    // Other quest loading operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or database
    reload processes. It performs database queries to fetch creature-quest relationships
    and stores them in internal lookup tables for fast access during gameplay. The
    method should only be called after the database connection is established and
    valid.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that database connections are properly
    initialized before invoking this method.
