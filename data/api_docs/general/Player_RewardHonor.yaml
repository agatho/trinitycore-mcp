documentation:
  brief: Reward honor points to player based on kill victim and group size
  description: The RewardHonor method distributes honor points to a player based on
    the kill of a victim and the group size. It is used in the context of World of
    Warcraft's honor system where players earn honor points for defeating opponents,
    particularly in battlegrounds or arenas. The method handles the calculation and
    distribution of honor points according to game mechanics, including the source
    of honor gain and the size of the group involved in the kill. This method is typically
    called when a player successfully kills an opponent and needs to receive honor
    points.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: Pointer to the victim's GUID (unique identifier) that was killed,
      used for calculating honor points based on the victim's level and faction.
  - name: groupsize
    description: The size of the group involved in the kill, which affects how honor
      points are distributed. Larger groups result in less individual honor point
      per player.
  - name: honor
    description: The amount of honor points to be awarded, typically calculated based
      on the victim's level and group size.
  - name: source
    description: The source of the honor gain, indicating how the honor was earned
      (e.g., battleground, arena, or other game mechanics).
  returns: Returns true if honor points were successfully awarded to the player, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if the player is not in a valid state for
    receiving honor points or if the honor calculation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int victim = 12345;

      uint32 groupsize = 5;

      int32 honor = 100;

      HonorGainSource source = HONOR_GAIN_BATTLEGROUND;

      bool result = player->RewardHonor(&victim, groupsize, honor, source);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = new Player();\nint victim = 12345;\nuint32 groupsize =\
      \ 10;\nint32 honor = 200;\nHonorGainSource source = HONOR_GAIN_ARENA;\nbool\
      \ result = player->RewardHonor(&victim, groupsize, honor, source);\nif (result)\
      \ {\n    // Player received honor points\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other honor-related methods
    like RewardHonorPoints or HonorGain. It requires the player to be in a valid state
    for receiving honor points, such as being in a battleground or arena. Performance
    considerations include handling of group size and victim level calculations for
    proper honor point distribution.
  warnings: The method may fail if the player is not in a valid state for receiving
    honor points, such as being outside of battlegrounds or arenas. Also, if the victim's
    GUID is invalid or the group size is incorrect, the method might return false.
