api:
  class: BotPacketRelay
  method: RelayToGroupMembers
  signature: void BotPacketRelay::RelayToGroupMembers(BotSession * botSession, const
    WorldPacket * packet)
documentation:
  brief: Relays a packet to all members of the bot's group.
  description: The RelayToGroupMembers method forwards a given WorldPacket to all
    players within the same group as the specified bot session. This functionality
    is typically used in bot systems where a bot needs to communicate game events
    or actions to its group members. The method ensures that packets are properly
    formatted and sent to each group member, maintaining synchronization between the
    bot and its group. It operates under the assumption that the provided botSession
    is valid and has an active group membership.
  parameters:
  - name: botSession
    description: Pointer to the BotSession instance representing the bot whose group
      members will receive the packet. Must not be null.
  - name: packet
    description: Pointer to the WorldPacket that will be relayed to all group members.
      The packet must be properly constructed and contain valid data for transmission.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Packet Relay Example
    code: 'BotSession* session = botMgr->GetBotSession(12345);

      WorldPacket packet(SMSG_CHAT_MESSAGE, 100);

      // ... populate packet with data ...

      botRelay->RelayToGroupMembers(session, &packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot session has a valid group and that all group
    members are online. The method does not perform any validation on the packet itself
    beyond ensuring it is not null.
  warnings: Ensure that the packet being relayed is appropriate for group communication
    to avoid sending unintended data or causing client-side issues. Avoid relaying
    large packets frequently as this may impact performance.
