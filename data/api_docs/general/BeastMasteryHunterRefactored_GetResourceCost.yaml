  class: BeastMasteryHunterRefactored
  method: GetResourceCost
  signature: uint32 BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::GetResourceCost(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the resource cost for a specified Beast Mastery hunter
    spell.
  description: The GetResourceCost method retrieves the resource cost associated with
    a given Beast Mastery hunter spell ID. This method is typically used within the
    context of spell casting mechanics to determine the required focus or energy expenditure
    before a spell can be executed. It plays a crucial role in enforcing game balance
    by ensuring that hunters cannot cast spells without meeting their resource requirements.
    The method likely accesses internal spell data structures and applies any relevant
    modifiers or calculations based on the hunter's current state, such as talent
    points or buffs.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the Beast Mastery hunter spell for which
      to calculate the resource cost. Valid values are integer identifiers corresponding
      to specific spells in the game's spell database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the resource cost (e.g., focus or energy)
    required to cast the specified spell. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    either no resource cost or an invalid spell ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 cost = hunter->GetResourceCost(1106); // Calculate cost for Kill\
      \ Command\nif (cost > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell casting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting Logic
    code: "void CastBeastMasterySpell(uint32 spellId)\n{\n    uint32 resourceCost\
      \ = GetResourceCost(spellId);\n    if (resourceCost > 0 && player->GetPower(POWER_FOCUS)\
      \ >= resourceCost)\n    {\n        player->ModifyPower(POWER_FOCUS, -static_cast<int32>(resourceCost));\n\
      \        // Proceed with actual spell casting\n    }\n    else\n    {\n    \
      \    // Handle insufficient resources\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may internally query the spell database and perform calculations
    based on player state. It is recommended to cache results when frequently accessed
    in performance-critical sections of code. The method assumes valid spell IDs are
    passed; invalid IDs might return unexpected values or cause undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-Beast Mastery spell ID may result in incorrect
    resource cost calculations or potential crashes. Always validate spell IDs before
    calling this method if the input source is untrusted.
