  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: AssignObjectiveToGroupMember
  signature: uint32 ObjectiveTracker::AssignObjectiveToGroupMember(Group * group,
    Player * member, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a quest objective to a specific group member within the ObjectiveTracker
    system.
  description: The AssignObjectiveToGroupMember method is responsible for associating
    a specified quest objective with a particular player member of a group in the
    TrinityCore framework. This functionality is typically used during quest assignment
    or progression tracking within group scenarios, ensuring that each group member's
    progress towards a shared quest objective is properly recorded and managed. The
    method operates within the context of the ObjectiveTracker class, which manages
    quest-related objectives for players and groups. It requires a valid group reference,
    a specific group member (player), and the identifier of the quest to be assigned.
    The method returns a unique identifier that represents the assigned objective
    within the tracking system.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group to which the member
      belongs. Must be a valid, non-null pointer to an active group.
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the specific group member
      who will be assigned the quest objective. Must be a valid, non-null pointer
      to a player currently in the group.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier (uint32) of the quest that is being assigned as
      an objective to the specified group member. Must correspond to a valid quest
      in the game database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the assigned
    objective within the ObjectiveTracker system. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    failure or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      Player* member = group->GetMember(0);

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 objectiveId = objectiveTracker->AssignObjectiveToGroupMember(group, member,
      questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "if (group && member) {\n    uint32 questId = 12345;\n    uint32 objectiveId\
      \ = objectiveTracker->AssignObjectiveToGroupMember(group, member, questId);\n\
      \    if (objectiveId != 0) {\n        // Successfully assigned\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Assigned objective %u to player %s\", objectiveId, member->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Assignment failed\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to assign objective for quest %u to player %s\", questId, member->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in group quest handling logic and assumes that
    the provided group and member are valid and properly initialized. The ObjectiveTracker
    system maintains internal state for tracking objectives, so repeated calls with
    the same parameters may result in duplicate entries or unexpected behavior if
    not handled carefully.
  warnings: Ensure that both the Group and Player pointers are valid before calling
    this method to avoid crashes or undefined behavior. Also, verify that the questId
    corresponds to an existing quest in the database; otherwise, the assignment may
    fail silently or produce incorrect tracking results.
